DJ Tiësto,"That summer, we talked endlessly
Always, about everything,
Fusion, nothing new for you
I felt, hey, under and, cool breezes
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember

We argue, constantly
Disagree, about everything
Distance, nothing new for me
I feel uneasy, under this thing
Thoughts away
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, i remember
I remember

And darkness falls in my eyes
And days are far from rosy now
And if I asked for the sky
Would you still shelter me
When the sky falls

I remember
I remember

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, hidden in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
I remember
Sitting in my memory
I remember",In My Memory

DJ Tiësto,"We go our separate ways through the portals of love
Truth was in creating, not the aftermath
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
But I will keep the memories for when my soul gets weary

Bittersweet stores, they always have no end
In the quietude of daybreak, we watch the sunlight bend
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
Now I'm late for the urban train to get back on the road again

Running thristy in the rain
I'm breaking through those clouds again",Suburban Train
DJ Tiësto,"You are an obsession 
I cannot sleep
I am your possession
Unopened at your feet
There's no balance
No equality
Be still I will not accept defeat

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

[Chorus]
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me

I feed you I drink you
My day and my night
I need you I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest
You want to leave
Stay
Oh, there's no alternative

Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger beware
A circumstance
In your naked dreams
Your affection is not what it seems

[Chorus]

My fantasy has turned to madness
And all my goodness 
Has turned to badness
My need to possess you
Has consumed my soul
My life is trembling
I have no control

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

DJ Tiësto,"You can travel the world but you can't runaway
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be make us believe
In you keep all your light in the dark
If you're searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And makes of what you can see
Just be, just be

They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step that you take
When you want to be real.
Flying on planes,
To exotic locations won't teach you how you really feel.
Face up to the fact,
That you are who you are
And nothing could change that belief.

Just be, Just be

'Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
And I'm this far
Is this the me

To just be

Love can come again
You gotta believe that

Breathing with blood and bones
Still no words we can speak
Of paths to be chosen

Tell me

So I let you set me free
Into sweet misery

Like the world around you's breaking
And it feels
Like there's no one else around you

There's a silence in the darkness

In the crowded empty spaces
And you stare
At the emptiness around you
You wanna go
To the city and the bright lights
Get away
From the sinners that surround you

'Cause I will be there
And you will be there
We'll find each other in the dark
And you will see
And I'll see you too

Then it's coming for me

And if it terrifies you
Then it terrifies me

I want you to stay with me

Burn me a fire
Rest something in my empty hands
Fill it with light
Fill me tonight

Up until dawn
Sweat on your palms
Feeling you poor me in out in
Under again
Under my skin
Guiding me through this hall of fears

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sing in my head
Omnipotent
Circling momentum round and round
Quenching my thirst
First for my thought
Second to fill my silent mouth

You're bright the darkness my love
In moments with you
There is no end tp me or beginning to you

I found what was missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na

I found what is missing inside you
Break my fall

Always with you
Connected by blood my love
A purpose fulfilled
You're my light in this dark, dark world

This unspoken within
I feel complete my love
The moments apart
I'm craving your light in the dark

Rock to the beat like my name can survive
Give me that heat 'til we all feel the fire

And you let it go, just let it go
And you feel life fall away, and you have no fear

You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here

It will soon disappear and will be miles away
Away from here

You need somewhere to start

Held you till morning, and Kissing your eyes.
Remembering your lips, When we first kissed,

That bind me to you.
It's not the things you say, Not the things you say ooh oh,
That matter.
Oh, how deep the ocean, stare at the sun
Our tears were glistening, Haunted your soul
If I could just hold you, Oh for the last time
I'd scare off those demons, And dry up your eyes

DJ Tiësto,"Waiting for the light to change from red
Thinking over all the things you said to me
You said to me
All your dreams are dying in the sun
Pretty soon there'll be nowhere left to run away
To run away

You packed your bags to leave by the morning
Destination far off and foreign
It's never or now
It's never or now

Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you
With you
Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you
With you
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone tonight
Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you
With you

Memories of a life I leave behind
Take a souvenir to remind me of
The ones that love

Feel my heart it beats like a stopwatch
Running out of time with each tick tock
It's never or now
It's never or now

Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you
With you
Baby won't you take me

DJ Tiësto,"Blacked out,
Everything's faded on your love,
I’m already wasted, so close
That I can taste it now, now

So let’s break right out of these guilty cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights

White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore no

We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for
What are we waiting for

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights

Feel that you're all something
You had my head choose up my just appeal
You're knocking down pretend that you’ve seen nothing

Wait, the hands across your face
Seem more than words can say
You're catching on to something in my eye
You see I just can't wait
I just won't let you buy
You seem surprised to even see me try

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You're the one I’m dreaming of

Hope that I too ever think like that Sunday (Sunday)

I'm picking up the pieces
Left on the ground

And some days
Are very long
I don't know where I'm meant to belong

Don't you hide from me
And don't you erase
What we used to be
Yesterday is far away
I'm lost in space

But the fire's burning
The fire's burning
Oh, I feel this love
And I'm giving up
'Cause nothing left for me to say

I'm reaching up
'Cause we're burning now
A million light years away

It's pulling me like gravity
It's telling me it aren't over
Light years away
Light years away, away, away

Satellites are crashing down
I watch you disappear at the speed of sound
Much feelings out of control
And where my heart lays
Now a black hole

Miles and miles away
Closing my eyes
Just to see you again
Memories are not enough
To leave me with

And my fire's burning

DJ Tiësto,"We’re not living in a snow globe Hollywood
There’s no rehearsal and our stage is an open book
It’s a landslide we’re never gonna ride again, again
So let go even when it kills you
Breakout from everything that built you
Wide awake, let your windows break

Set yourself free
And let the light through
Set yourself free
From what’ll blind you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
Set yourself free
From what’ll rest you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you

Indecision is the heart’s worst enemy
The tunnel vision to a true identity
It’s a land mine that everyone’s afraid to land
To land

Breakout from everything that built you
Wide awake, let your windows break

And let the light through

Before I got to say
Don’t let me get away

'Cause no one ever told you

Do you know when you go
All the lights go out, around me
Do you know when you go, I just wanna disappear
And take myself away in an ordinary day
Your shimmer

I ?
I can't appreciate
Till you illuminate
And I scream just to hear myself again
Over the silence in my head
And it’s killing me away

And I just can’t see it straight

And every morning is an hourglass

Til none of our planets could align

DJ U-Neek,"Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Can you me where I'm going
Am I going down
What am I supposed to feel
Am I having doubts
Life is not always showing
Am I safe and sound
The truth and what is really real
See I'm living all alone
Playing solitaire 
But it's kinda hard
When all the cards ain't there
And I'm starting to dig
All the voices inside my head
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?

Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Seems I am always thinking 
Of many things
Of how my life used to be
I'm doubting me
Before my world started sinking
I don't wanna drown
I used to feel so free
But now my back's against the wall
Can't see light at all
Every time I try and play pool
It takes my ball
And I don't care about nothing at all
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong

And you're losing your mind 
Trying find out what's going on

But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs
The real revolution ain't about booty size
The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives
And though we've lost Biggie Smalls
Baby your notorious revolution
Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush
Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees
Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
And produce little future emcees
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep
With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
Doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got
And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot
And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
Or helping you fantasize
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
No no, not between these thighs
Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
And really fantastic
And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla, 
Butter pecan, chocolate delux
Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just 'cause you made a few bucks?
Please brother please
Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense

Your revolution will not happen between these thighs

Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking

I'm more enhanced, and more co-operative, communal spawn ta live
I shot the gift provocatively
Held it down like shocking it
Puffed any green seteva I can hit and dough the chocolate
Sat with wise mentor sit and talk a bit of the apocalypse
And how to make this world that's about to end a bit more positive
The first, his voice was rough and needed some throat lozenges
He offered his opinion, youthful with expression, talkative
The second one had more method with; he moved and plodded with
He said the world has cheated karma and must be now audited
The third one seemed a bit more centred as he led us on a ship
He said something's just can't be and found we exist as onuses

So live it now

DJ Vadim,"I feel that most of you soldiers are flimsy
How the hell did you get over as an emcee
Now the dialogue injectors they simply
And I respect those that hold it against me
Paid rules and made rules to break rules
Stayed cool amongst tools and fake fools
Gave jewels to use from cradle to grade school
To the grave and still wade through the pools of
I love you and I hate you

And the turntable keeps on turnin' and turnin'
Nothing can fuck w/ the way it goes around

First off focus, figure out why you wrote it
What's the motive, what you use to grow it
Do the people want it, do they need it
Or would they rather that you keep it
Is the party not poppin', or at least a couple of heads noddin'
Does the pass or fail depend on whether or not a check's gotten
Is it the laughter, the love, the hope
Is it the aspiration to make other rappers think you're dope
Is it the fans, the adoration of devils and angels
The hunger, you want more than left over eggroll
Shit, I made a video, I ain't even got cable
So if you ain't down w/ what we do you better lay low
My future's made of play dough, past is made of stone
Virgo playboy slug is dumb building a home
And it lead me to believe the 3d that I breathe
Through the TV and the CD be the need to grit the teeth
A 20 something wasteland, here comes the out of place space man
Spread the wingspan, staring at the ocean like it was a woman
Hoping that she'll let me run my toes through her pink sand

Now here I sit in this cellar
Writing my interpretations of helter skelter
It goes 1 part hustler, 2 parts good guy
Sounds like it should,but the shit doesn't look right
Took my hook and pierced your skin, so now when I say jump
Y'all say when, when I say now all of y'all say where
When I say atmos, you say phere
You know me, but just the me I let you see
The me you need to so you could set yourself free
You'll have to shut slug up to fuck slug up
But for now baby close your mouth and lift your butt up

Placing bets on who would leave the set w/ a bloody nose

Before I knew that this network existed
Just another baggy pants sweat shirted misfit
The pilot sticker bombed spell it right s-l-you-g

DJ Vadim,"I'm vexed and perplexed like Malcolm X
On stage with chains around their necks
From the thread of the governments evil flex
I'm taking steps against the kind of lies they try to bring me
As a ? soldier with ?
Daily papers they're just propaganda scriptures from the government
It's not the daily news, it's the daily satanical supplement
Cause they don't deal with holy testaments just war and pestilence
Can I get a witness I don't need one in fact there's too much evidence
Spying on the people lying evil little devils
They're recruiting demon soldiers while they execute our rebels
CCTV cameras set up on no man's borders
They're not for law and order, they're Lucifer's camcorders
Politicians they're not concord borders they're using flying saucers
Decide to take to the sky or travel underwater
Chameleon type reptilians moving they're tongues like geckos
And they're trying to turn our ghettos into over sized death rows
You want heroin there's tons of that, guns and crack
But who's got the funds and cash the same people who supply guns to Iraq
They're pimping the public like rent boys prostitutes and hookers
Bringing strain to the brain as you remain in this giant pressure cooker
Behind your back trying to took your promise the world and overlook us
Spreading the evil love of Beelzebub, these human race butchers
Mankind destroyers, life I'm chasing those Freemasons
Chasing 'em back to the place of birth to reverse all of their creations
Scientists give us fabrication of mathematical equations
But the square root of my truth will cause the devil devastation

Well listen I'm more than vexed
I live in a time where I can't afford to flex
The police are stopping and searching just like some illegal border checks
You better beware we're living inside of lucifers era
My cypher's been scientifically sent back in time to prepare ya
So start stoning the Babylonians to show you're controlling then
Cause this Babylon been fueling my anger just like petroleum
I'm scolding them with the hard rhymes from a scarred mind
From living amongst the hard times
Where people just working through all of the serpentine
The devils disciple that stifle our plans for freedom
If wee keep conforming to all these laws set by the demons
They're thinking they're intellects
By plugging the whole world with the internet
If they thinking they got me they're information be incorrect
I'm using my third eye to guide I through the wilderness
Cause the system in Babylon's bad and there's enough people that's skilled in this
I'm vexed with the devils descendents with paganist pendants
For having the lack of faith and a disregard for repentance
My lyrical sentence is longer than people that's charged for child sex
Cause all the disordered leaders are into having a wild flex
I'm vexed with the government sects for giving this minimum wage
And working this nine 'til five bringing heat to my simmering rage
I spit this lyrical wisdom to charge down the Babylon systems
The rebellious Rastafarian that's flinging his fist to the system

Listen Atti if the devil tries to take Selassie
Put some you lose more blood than the face of Arturo Gati
I'm a raw rhyming anti smoking idol keeping it tribal
While reading pages of the bible to gain vision as a disciple
Studying at rasta night school while using my tongue as a rifle
Sniping you worse than the bible cause life I'm all about survival
I spitting my violent recitals so bright that they melt your eyeballs
Turning the Anti-Christ suicidal wrestle the devil like Shawn Michaels
The clash of the titans will over crush the devil and take his title
Phi-Life will remain his messengers cause a rasta revival
No time to idle the rastas are rising black we come to wipe out crack
Paint the Whitehouse black and speak real fast to the children
Expose our government foes who know the truth will never be told
They teach the people the root of all evil while they're stashing all of the gold
Attacking their souls and spirits until your life is finished
Phi-Life I spit the righteous lyrics
Chained the minds of the cynics held the blind endemic
Cause when I talk my vocal is blessed with holy powers
Making the devils cower while shaking the foundations of the Babylon tower
I terminate them like T2 when I spit my scriptures in Hebrew
A politicians not an honest man like a hologram he be see-through
Trying to deceive you lead you up the path so that they can feed you
Phi-Life I'm a friend of races representing the rasta nation
So when we flex on a rhythm we draw on the powers of the law of exorcism
Inject the rhythm of the holy serum purify all the fat cats
Who experiment on innocent lives of people like they were monkeys or lab rats

My sound tear the transponders out of your pounds
And explode Babylon satellites that scanning down to the ground
With the type of coast to reveal we're living under a microscope
My cipher be strangling Babylonians with the tightest rope
I'm fringing the violence you can fuck with living with silence
Cause before long they be forcing us into buying a breathing license
I'm dissing authority with my forces of purity
I piss in the parliament and I fart on the face of conformity
I never fill in the government census they cunningly sent us
It's asking me information like what I ate for my breakfast
Cause we the Messiah that's bringing more fire to the empire
With the type of tribal recitals that's setting Satan on fire
We're culling the paganist shaman the Phi-Life Cypher will slay them
Reveal the seventh seal to start the freemason complaining
With positive action infiltrates into paganist factions
I smashing your PlayStation and all these tools of distraction
With adequate satisfaction I smashing Babylon's walls
To stop all the gat cat bureaucrats from giving it all",Ghetto Rebels
DJ Wally,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

And I keep the faith in the Knicks, them fuckers
And I'm quick to get slick with the lip and word to mother
love a dude with a doo-rag, from where we suffer
from growin up too fast, I'm a rude ass bitch when I need to be
But I'm cool as shit if you real with me, you feelin me?
I never sleep like my city when it's time to get this money
Got game, spot game, so don't act funny (hah hah)

From Staten, to Long Island, we make it happen, out in

I'm tired of that punk shit
Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

It's time to research the documents and pull some files
And put it down with this gangsta style
'Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
After peace treaty meetings and the weapons down

Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check

Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
niggas have done did when the steel'll blast

Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin' rough in a bucket, tuckin' tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block

Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin' 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin' all the activity
That's how we livin' G, strictly killer tendencies

So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy

On the East fuck peace we ridin violent
Fuck where you been it's all about where I been
Sirens, gunshots, flood glocks get popped

Flip your own money, make your own proper
Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya
Be a boss hog about your money, float loc

like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit
Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!

DJ Whoo Kid,"Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama, busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga

""Brothers we better get hip""

""And come off this trip""

Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

DJ Whoo Kid,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

DJ X,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to ley you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
And they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everthing 
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love

I can't believe the things I do for you

The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?
Will, blow, your, mind

Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die

Now pause, now pause

I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause

Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move

DJ Yoda,"I said a hip hop,
Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow.  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball.  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again.  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ.  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind.  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat.
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat.
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak.
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight.
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn",Rapper's Delight

DJ Yoda,"Shut the bedroom window in the morning
Go to the shop, make plans to be leaving
In the morning 
Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
An ally cat chewing on dead leaves
In the morning 

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes I will be alright 

When I leave I try not to wake her
We had a toast to yesterday's capers
In the morning 

She wrote my name on a red telephone box
When I got there she'd already rubbed it off
In the morning 

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes I will be alright 

And all this time I've watched it change
But it's still the same

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early

DJ Yoda,"Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, i guess you just might
want to do a dance or two
'cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep

Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, ""we'll hurt you""
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, ""yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep",Just to Get a Rep
DJ Yoda,"Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fat Lip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon
Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star

See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap""

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow, my family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon

(I float upstream again)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?
Wow, who knew?

Did you know
What?
That I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me? Amazing, Geez

Polluted water can kill both baby salmon
That are developing and the adult salmon
That are on their way to spawn

Remember how in love we were?
So in love.
So in love.
Once.
So in love.
Once.

She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I?ll never be nothing she wasn?t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn?t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn?t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

And if I had a chance to do it all over I?d do it exactly the same

I was a be-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it?s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that was fulfulling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn?t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let?s try again
But I wasn?t buying in
Didn?t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it?s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn?t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I?m a veteran what?s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she?s in disguise
And I just didn?t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we?re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I?m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I?ll see you in the wind

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

My best old jeans and broke-in sneakers

The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect

She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump-shot that's nothin' but net
She's a handful of aces when the dealer's done dealin'
And I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feelin'

I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her

Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world.

Always saying little girl don't step into the club.
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why 'cause dancing's what I love.

Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy.
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy.

What's practical is logical. What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there.

I'm a slave for you. I cannot hold it, I cannot control it.
I'm a slave for you. I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it.

Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place.
Oh baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, and age.
(Lets go)

(Like that)
(You like it)
(Now watch me)

Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)

I really wanna dance, tonight with you.
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to.
(I just feel I let myself go)

I really wanna dance, tonight with you.
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to.
But did you want me to.
(Uh Uh Uh)

Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place.
Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, and age.

I'm a slave for you (take that) I cannot hold it, I cannot control it.
I'm a slave (it just feels right) for you (it just feels good)
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it (baby)

Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)

Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)


I'm a slave for you (here we go now)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it.

DJ's Choice,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last",Crocodile Rock [Instrumental]

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

DJ's Choice,"Boy, the way Glenn Miller played 
songs that made the hit parade.
Guys like me we had it made.
Those were the days.
Didn't need no welfare state,
ev'rybody pulled his weight,
gee our old LaSalle ran great.
Those were the days.
And you knew who you were then,
girls were girls and men were men.
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again.
 
People seemed to be content,
fifty dollars paid the rent,
freaks were in a circus tent.
Those were the days.
Take a little Sunday spin,
go to watch the Dodgers win.
Have yourself a dandy day,
that cost you under a fin. 
Hair was short and skirts were long.
Kate Smith really sold a song.

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

Django Bates,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Django Bates,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

You're always wanna go
You want to go somewhere
Where you don't know

And when you run
And when I try to run
You leave me bent over
With a stitch in the road

You are a maze
A complex sum
I've counted all my fingers
And I'm on to my thumb

You are a storm
You are my little storm
I watch the wind change
To find out where you've been blown

Pull it up
And steer it up
This game is over

You conjure a key
In the palm of your hand
You're burning all your bridges
Drawing a line in the sand

We travel far
Catch the last of the sun
We keep on going
Til we've nowhere to run

Look at the hills
They look so green
The horizon is the place
That you always dream

We shoot the nest
Like a bolt from a gun
You're tapping on the door
To the beat of the drum

Hold it up
And steer it up
This game is over

Look at the [?]
They look so free
It's the only real thing

Django Django,"Always look at the white sky and you lose your head in the clouds
Wanna step onto them and float onto their ground
You appear from the hillside and there's a funny look in your eye
Between a rock and a hard place and I will either do or say die

Spins the phrases together 'til something starts to make sense
Talk of the future ignoring the present tense
Start shining the night sky you light up like a solar flair
Won't just burn up on contact as we enter the atmosphere

Django Django,"That how you want to play it
Break my heart and go home
Why'd you want to go do that, but we're not even in the way

That how you want to sing it
I've been having loads of fun
I think I've heard that song before it ends up as a book

That how you want to see it
If you just have a 'tongue?'
Tunnel vision, never listen, no we're never going home

You're a good time killer
Why did you end up on your own
Overlook at Acapulco playing paper, scissors , stone

You told the fortune teller
The crystal ball is going to show
Uri Geller's going to tell or bend the truth so I don't know

Sea has something stirring
On the currents down below
There's a beach out of reach, pack it up so we can go

Crystal leaks start all over
Switch it up and overhaul
Step in line, get in time, speed it up until we fall

It doesnt matter if you can't say no
You say I'm never gonna be dishearted
You only tell me what I need to know
It doesnt matter if it left us stranded
I'll build a raft and tow us back to shore
It's not the way that anybody planned it
You know we should have thought about all this before

I'll climb up high to all the furthest branches
And gather fruit from all the tallest trees
You always said that we should take our chances
Watch the dust blow for a change of breeze
We venture out into the great uncharted
So far away from any beaten track
Enjoy it now before it's all departed
You know that once it's gone that there'll be no way back

Silver rays ricochet
And dance across the golden floor
Silver rays you can stay
And let me drift away from shore
Silver rays shadows play
And become the one that I adore
Silver rays cast away
And illuminate forever more",Silver Rays

Side effects
Have you walking in a daze
Another fall out from this thing just radiates

You'll be the first
I'll always be the last
I'll duck and cover 'till the threat is past

Make your move now and try to win the game
But in the end it always stays the same
Don't shy away behind those lost in lines
I read between them almost every time

Hold the fight
It's all I'm asking for
But the aftershock just shook me to the girl

Flick the switch
And watch it all around
Best get out before

How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing is up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when we step through the mirror
Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last, are you still there?
Face up to the facts
For guessing that we shared, step out of rhythm and fall into place

Open the shudders, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?

Take what you want take anything

Lift them higher so they're never hanging over you

In the shadow of the heaven that you're holding on
Nervous or something, birds are bright
Cut all the lights, lit up the night
What a sight
Looking over on the city that you once belonged
Shrug your shoulders at the people who have done you wrong
Walking about the crowded street
The ones you love ten thousand feet below
Take the throne back, now we're singing the same old song
Hold the throne now, 'cause you never loved to move along
Never give up all through the years
It's plain to see, straight through the tears your mistakes

Looking down to the worms
Way below, standing tall giant

We'll be closer when you turn the world upon its head
Hand it over and I'll carry it along instead
Show me your hands so I can see
I'll understand more easily all the time

Chasing a treasure we're elusive and few
Just catching flashes of emerald and blue

The thunder claps as I'm struck by my idol
I'm falling backwards I need your revival
So many patterns and shapes that came found me
I'm overcome by the love that's around me
We're carried higher can see all around us
It was the doctors but they likely found us
Across this landscape to cities and people
I never found that this love could be equal
Follow behind me I need you right into the sun

Capturing quick and in hearts when you be

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

 Just a lonely refrain

 Hoping I'll find my love, find my love

 Who knows some day someone may come along
 And change my lonely song to happiness
 Unitl the darkness fades into the dawn
 I'll just go on, I guess

 Just a dreamer am I
 Hoping I'll find a rainbow

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Eu nem sei te dizer quanta dor
Mesmo a noite não sabia
O que o amor escondía

Foi um raio de ilusão

Bem no meu coração

Dissabor e tudo
Veio com tudo

Longe já se vão os meus día s de paz
Hoje com a lua clara brilhando

Aquilo era quase o amor
Você me acelerou, acelerou
Me deixou desigual
Chegou pra mim
Me deu um daqueles sinais
Depois desacelerou
E eu fiquei muito mais
Sempre esperarei por ti
Chegue quando
Sonho em teus braços
Dormir, descansar
Venha e a vida pra você será boa
Cedo, que é pra gente se amar a mais

Quando te vi

Muito mais perdido

é mercê de amigo

Você bem que merece

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place

For the boys on MTV

Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show

But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

May not be what you want from me

Que no confiara en ti
Que tu amor no era sincero
Y por ti mi pobre vieja

Me sacrifique por ti

Pero yo era inocente

Cuando una pasion te ciega
Aunque hoy me pase a mi
Esto le pasa a cualquiera
Creo que no soy el primero
Que una mujer engaño
Tu fuiste pa' Nueva York
Con tu visa de paseo
Pero pasaron los dias,
Semanas, meses y años
Y yo aqui en Santo Domingo
Quede, tu amor esperando
Hasta ayer que me contaron
Que con otro te has casado

Por causa del trabajo why otras tonterias 
Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo

For people to read, I'm doin' this cause I need people to see, and touchin' a feelin'
And enter the spirit that is runnin' through me, I was born emcee
So when I was young I said I want to emcee, gonna emcee, using me
At 3:00 am in front of BoDangles, eatin' Potato Chips, n
Watchin' the day go by, with dreams of the day that I get paid to rhyme
And probally why I stay so high, blazen' a lot
But now a days we call it ""puffin' the trees"", nigga's ain't high
But now a days we call everybody emcee's
I don't mean to preach, but emcee's a level that you gotta reach
Respectin' history, be open to learn, and what it will teach
I master each and every lyrical style that you'll ever need
So lyrically-musically spiritually, guess that women's all you'll ever need
Please believe!
Uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm an urban entertainer of the hot nights
I don't want to see no end because it's not right

I'm just a brother who never
Compromised his integrity
My legacy is heavenly
Bury me in the hood
Never think I'm not cautious, hey
I recognise what a wrong look'll cost us
So inside I'm always nervous
But I never look worried
Come for me
Gun shot flurries in a hurry
Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me
Lord, please talk to these boys
'Fore I leave they evening spoilt
Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed
And when the 'hood get dry I supply the need
y'all faggot niggaz keep it moving honey riding with me
So what ya want?

[Jemini]
And I never politic when I be on some cool out shit
Don't even run up on me talking 'bout some artist that you signed
'cause I don't really give a fuck and I ain't really got the time
I'm trying to put some money in my clothes
Sean clothes, Jah clothes
First, did you come with six zeros?
Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe
Jah done made the reservation so we ready to peel
For real, without no hesitation Nitty bustin' the steel
So what ya what?

Mixed with a little cheese (from Coolie High)
Mommy how you gonna move? (when it's just you and I)
Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggaz know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will
But when the shells get to flying and I don't got skill
I get ghost then I bounce
Come back and a nigga be ready to throw toast

You can get it however you want it
'Cause I can spit it however ya like
Man, shit be tight nigga ya might need kryptonite
Man, you say that you want it
So you better take whatever you get tonight
See my problem is I never learned to lie for shit
Sometimes I get sperm in my eye 'cause I be on my own dick

Listen, momma said there'd be days like this
Where I'd have to set the record straight on a plagiarist
Who played the fifth row
Had to let the kid know even if he played the fifth
I'd still get in his ass like a wedgie
Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen
Murder music murder men
The mo' time go by the mo' intense my lyrical flow
To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches
You succeed with flukes and coincidences
You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches
Defenseless against this
From the beginning it was senseless
You bit more than you could chew
It's knocking out your dentures
""But I but I but I but I but I but I but I I figga, that I'm a bad nigga I'm
a bad nigga
I'm a bad bad nigga""

[Chorus]

[Jemini]
I love it when it's my turn
And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggaz down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lockjawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it
Nigga listen!

[chorus]

[Jemini]
So check the rhyme to the rhythm
Or shiver when I give a
Very fat deliver-why
The process only Jemini, me
Other MC's is corny I set ya souls free
The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer
I got rhymes in the clip plus one inside the chamber
Danger, so cock the glock near ya jock

Instead of niggaz ice-grillin' me
When they really be, feeling me
Lyrically it's just a facade
To hide their inabilities
And their insecurities
Picture me, giving a damn
I've been in the joint
Pitting lyrics written with pistols with venomous points
I explode through the whole first step be murder on the sole of my kicks
Spittin while I'm holding my dick
In the, circle of squares
This area here
Is something you don't want to fuck around with

I got a little bit of, something for you, it's lyrical too
Get up in the, middle of you, like miracles do
Help you grow in your mental and your spiritual too
Help your hearing and your visual too
Tell 'em Jemini said it
I come to set it, break it down in phonetics
Dip it in egg whites and bread it
And serve it up hot
When I'm up in your spot
Like a tasty, pastry treat

And copy gear quick to seen a rap cat with it

And you and I both know it's a shame I gotta lead
'cause others choose to follow
That's a hard pill to swallow for some

And I've been doin' it since you rappin' cats was still in diapers
But it seems to me these cats are gettin' too big for their britches
And they're barkin' up the wrong tree, callin' my women bitches
I remember, when we used to rhyme in the park
But things have changed, now they bustin' shots after dark
Now that's a shame, these youngsters see me in the streets
Ask me O.G. how you do it make it seem like nothin' to it
Well I never lost a dream, the hustle's still inside of me
And never even departed me, this rap shit didn't father me
I gave birth to a lot of M-C's on this earth

Don't worry about it, just know I'm in the game now
He was such a cute kid, why he sellin' cocaine now
But struggling's past tense, I'm rappin' now, bought myself a house
With a swimming pool, backyard and a glass fence
There's no time for celebration, mind elevation
If you ain't searchin' for money what the hell are you chasin'?
Go against I-C-U I'll put this barrel to your back
You know who this is, Lil Mizzo and Darryl Mack
I been a man since I got in the hood, flow so much niggas get jealous
Like I can't stand when he drop his hood
How could you not respect Run-D.M.C.
For bein' the first rappers to get they hand prints in Hollywood
They deserve the respect of a legend, and I'm tryin' hard
I can be the best rapper in less than a second

I would never leave the game my people love me too much
Because rap is my baby and I watched it grow up

They got the nerve to rap about cars and iced out jewels
Man you rented it from Jacob you ain't foolin' me or schoolin' D
On how to M-C, I be the pick of the litter
I've been in the game many years but I'll still spit a winner
Champ my people from the streets in Queens know I'm a hitter
Knockin' balls out the park, gettin' physically fitter
Don't duck too slow and don't jump too fast
I roll with young soldiers who put a foot in your ass

I have a lot of thoughts like who the hell am I
What is the truth and what is a lie?

But I think about my life and everything is okay
I gotta pave the way to a brighter day
'Cause it's really plain and simple when it came to me

There's a lot of people just like me (like me)
There's a whole lot just like me (like me)

[Chorus: Sarah Mclachlan]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin home, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then

1964, uhh! Here we go, aiyyo
The child was born it was a beautiful day
It was 1964, the 31st of May
The girl gave birth to a baby boy

He's not a burden, he's a bundle of joy
She was just a young girl in her youth
And her parents tried real hard to hide the truth
Is there a chance for the baby to live?
That is a chance that you gotta give [2X]

[Chorus]

[DMC]
It was 9 whole months inside of the womb
Another long month in the hospital room
Facin doom in a tomb cause the kid is alone
But somebody came along and they took the kid home

He came into the world like we all do
But he never ever knew how he came through
Do the best you can do if this happen to you
And understand all the words that I'm rappin to you [2X]

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Father is, the mother and the father is..
Yo, the mother and the father is all that he knows
They give him lots of love and you know that it shows
He's livin really well he has all that he needs

He came into the world and he's gonna succeed
It is a blessing to live in the light
If nothing is wrong then something is right
They say that life is a mystery

And I just wanna know my history
Understand that life is good to me
That's the way it is so (let it be)
My life is complete, everything is alright

Life is good to me, I'm in paradise
Understand when I'm rappin, no pain and sorrow
I just want you to know, yo yo [2X]
I'm alright ma
I'm alright pa.. na na na

[Chorus: singers - repeat 4X]
What's wrong with this world today (what's wrong with this world)

[DMC]
Check it out now
12 years old and I'm smokin on weed
I want a lot of stuff that I don't really need
14 years old and I'm drinkin on beer
What my parents gotta say I don't wanna hear
16 years old and I'm takin ecstasy
Girl next to me is gonna have sex with me
18 years old and I'm sniffin cocaine
Don't really care what it's doin to my brain

[singers]
Don't understand, why all the fuss
Why the grown-ups keep messin with us
I'm not gonna die just because I smoked dust
Smack me in the face just because I said a cuss
Treat 'em like kids, we should leave them alone
But they don't understand (I'm 12 and I'm grown)

[Chorus]

[Napolean]
At the age of 12 I was probably sellin weed
Seein the same things that DMC seen
Was a young cat that'd love to see you bleed
But what's goin on with this world tell me
Kids in the street eatin meals off the streets
Take me off the streets but can't stop the streets
At the age of 3 they got shot right in front of me
My moms and my daddy, shoulda never had me
16 years old my balls got swoll
Heart got cold and them glocks got load
Take it back to 15, pops was on the scene
Took me out the hood, showed me how to stack cream
Take it back to my breddern, age 11
Khadafi, the head brother, of Makaveli
Wasn't for you, the streets woulda failed me
Napolean, Outlaw, give 'em hell DMC

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Check it out
Today is the day that I bring a gun to school
The teacher dissed me and he played me for a fool
Tryin to play the role, tryin to be cool
Being {?} well I make the rules

[Napolean]
If I pull the trigger, I figure if he die
I say that I'm crazy, you know that's a lie

[DMC]
Just gotta act like I'm out of my mind
To be on the news, on the cover of Time

[Napolean]
Shoulda known I would do it, shoulda seen the signs
Been lovin guns ever since I was 9

[DMC] I played PlayStation
[Nap] And Nintendo too
[DMC] And love all the games
[Nap] When I'm shootin at you
[DMC] When my dad was young he used to go out and hunt
[Nap] It doesn't really matter man, I came to front

[both]
It doesn't really matter as a kid or a man
Cause the same thing can happen with a gun in your hand

",What's Wrong
Dmitri Matheny,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Dmitri Matheny,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!

Dmitri Pokrovsky,"You wrestle with your conscience 
to free your better self. 
But did you think for one moment 
you could be someone else? 
Between a rock and a hard place, 
is where you seem to be. 
You've been caught in a trap 
between the devil and the deep blue sea. 
All those nights so lonely, 
all the tears that you cry. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
You're in a situation, 
pray this time it will pass. 
But it feels like you're walkin' 
over miles and miles of broken glass. 
Painted into a corner 
where the sun never shines. 
Somebody's turned on the spotlight, 
you forgot to learn your lines. 
In the place you once called your heart 
there's a wound that's open wide. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
When you're thinking 'bout the hard times 
everyone's been through. 
But it won't make no difference, 
seeing things the way you do. 
In this blue condition 
you must search for the light. 
Don't believe them when they tell you, 
you can't hold back the night. 
Between a rock and a hard place, 
is where you'll always be. 
Caught in a trap 
between the devil and the deep blue sea. 
So many words unspoken. 
So many times you never tried. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
No, you can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
There's one thing you can't hide, 
it's the hurt inside.

Dmitry Baevsky,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired
You give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak 
You give me strength and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus in-between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect,but you'd like me to try
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie
'Til I die
Lord why is it that,I go through so much pain
All I saw was black,all I felt was rain
I come to you because its you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being,brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way,but I hid
And I remember once you held me close,but I slid
There was something that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it,but I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I've seen it,I can feel the change
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known a love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears with a song
And I almost lost faith when you took my man Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm saying won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good,cause I really didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer,for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die,but please Lord treat him right",Prayer

You ain't no fucking killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggas want, raw
Niggas laugh at me and was mad at me
Cause the way life was going had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it
So if I see it, I'ma dot it, where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it
Come on

[Chorus]

Niggas don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talking shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'ma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kidding why!
Make it double platinum, no bullshitting
And I'ma stay flipping flows, ripping shows
Stripping ho's, getting dough let me go
And nigas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast
Come on

[Chorus]",Ain't No Way
DMX,"(Jay) Fuck that 
(This is it right here baby)
You know what it is

Yo, I used to have bad luck 
Now you might see me in a Jag truck
Mad stuck, either with a dime or a bad duck
Double-R T with the matchin' bandana
38-snub blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryin' to glance at the 'Kiss
'Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Phoning your women, drunk off Corona's and lemon
And you know I'm still writin' the mean, lightin' the green
I need the bugy, even though I look, right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
'Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
(They call me) Raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me, you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss (uh-huh) a 100 for The L.O.X. (Yeah)
And if we cool, then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet, a z-bull's my pet
And you can bet he'll get the legs and the neck

Yo when my gun bust, send niggas to the fish like Swanson
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson, I put fear in y'all heads
Sheek Luc', type of nigga gasoline y'all beds
And that's warnin', if you all alive in the mornin', that's fine
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC, see me?  Tuck in your chains
I got niggas my pop's age that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like wake up, move a brick, half of it slow
Make car money, check with Sheek, go fuck with a hoe
I rock a waist length mink, do-rag under my fitted
And I don't even want waves, Timbs be halfway new
That's Sheek in the dress-up club 'cause I don't fuck with shoes
And for my nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
'Cause we got the same goal, and you try an' tamper with mine?
Don't make me motherfuckin' leave you with some shit in yo' spine
Fuck with me you be a was nigga, nigga was dope
Nigga was gettin' money 'fore I extorted your coke, 'ju crazy?

Ayo, catch me with a thirty-eight, box and shells
In a ninety-eight Lincoln eatin' pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of L's
Blow, stay on the low, get a Heine' and swig
I'm Pinero, so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit 'cause I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G.
Y'all niggaz is son-ned out, let me speak to your father
'Cause I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin' legit
You hold your nine if you holdin' a brick
Common sense, Fed drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L.O.X. get respect like Sonny from ""Bronx Tale""
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live, are y'all niggas eager to die?
I tell all my niggas ride, you won't leave with a dime
Motherfucker

Yeah, yeah
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters, wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers, bitches among us 
Tryin' not to let this bullshit become us 
It started from hunger, til it all went insane
Now bitches notice the chains now that I hit my number
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted
The beeper done changed, you dead bitch, the Reaper done came
I suggest niggaz stop speakin' my name
'Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creepin', streets keep watchin', I keep poppin '
Niggaz is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin'
Jay flow for pesos, chase hoes, not
I just circle 'round the block in a drop
Tell them jump through the top (Uh-huh) 
Where the sun roof used to be
I could see y'all not used to me
Nigga flows like none other, I'm the meanest
Toughest Don Dada, the gun butt ya
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya
I'm the type that get excited, when the gun touch ya, motherfuckers
Y'all niggas 'bout to witness a dynasty like no other

Grr. I'm headed nowhere fast
Run in the place, gat in my waist
Niggas wanted a taste, but wouldn't come to my face
So what that mean?  You cats is playin' games again
So now what I do?  Start namin' names again (What)
All you motherfuckers know, that I speak from the heart (Uh)
Play like you don't know, L.O.X. is gon' bark
We can take it there, but to make it fair, get some more niggas
Styles, Sheek, Jay, we comin' with like four niggaz (Aight)
Y'all niggaz, best to stop playin', it'll be the ones you forgotten about
That'll get you shot in your mouth
Got my dogs covered (Uh)

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go

I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the ?
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Like the side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
When they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh

[DMX]
I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood

[Mary J. Blige]
Now what's the moral to this story?

Give 'em dick, and they be buggin' 
I've done it all
From mackin' two hoes on a three-way 
Dominican hoes on freeway 
Country hoes in VA
And they all say the same about my game, it's tight 
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight 
Over some dick that they don't even own 
All I'm givin' 'em is the bone 
Blowin' up a niggas phone but ain't nobody home 
I'm in a zone tryin' to do things 
Let's turn this into a crew thing 
What's up, girlfriend, you game? 
No wonder why when I leave at night 
It's 'cause I thieve at night 
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right 
I fuck they head up with some slick shit 
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit 
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit 
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday 
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first day 

It's all good 
It's all right 
Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches 

It's all good 
It's all right 
Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches 

Flocks of bitches by the dozens 
From sisters to cousins 
Got 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't 
Ever gonna do like knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to 
Still gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to 
Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks 
Videos with the baddest hoes, sucking dick 
It's the dog in me that makes me do wrong 
Hunnies can't help but get strung (Why)
'Cause the game is too strong 
I like 'em greedy, black like Edi, eyes beady, willin' to give to the needy 
I done ran through 'em all 
From around the way bitches 
To them outta state hoes 
I'm even hitting gay bitches 
All I tell 'em is ""let me get that"" 
Then it's on 
Knock her mothafuckin' boots 
And then I'm gone 
I got the white bitches sayin' ""It's a black thing"" 
'Cause I leave that hoe with no dough and plenty back pain 

It's all good 
It's all right 
Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches 

It's all good

Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches 

Bitches who get props 'cause they know who can get got 
Who they can get shot by the way ya nigga's hip drop 
Walk up in the spot knowin' what she want strictly 
When hun wants the dickly, hun comes and gets me 
Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze 'cause that's daddy's baby 
I keep them hoes in check like the government 
Hittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick, and they lovin' it 
Huggin' it like it's they best friend 'cause it is, word to mix 
Fuckin' with tricks is just biz
I deal with strictly dimes 
Got 'em commitin' they first crimes 
Now she's suckin' dick for the first time 
And ain't no secret 'bout how I freak it when it's sleek it 
Never knew how I peeped it then creeped it 
That's how I know this must be that shit 
I tell them bitches ""I'll be back"" 
And they believe that shit 

It's all good 
It's all right 
Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches

What y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this war that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
Ride and die why
Cause my Niggas is wit it

I want Monopoly money but I ain't even half way there
Do a dirt and a nigga gotta take the backway there
What it is is the biz and its dirty
You'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty
Take the business to the hallways, driving up for four days
On parole with warrants that'll send me back the raw way
If I get caught across Jersey state lines
Figure this 98 and I been running since 89
So that's like 9 years delinquent time
You speaking crime than you know
9 years you owe it's not 9 years you gonna go
No probation or parole more time doing nothing
They roam to yard writing rhymes an fronting
Carry Niggas greasy because I'm built like that
Burry Niggas easy cause they get kilt like that
If you ain't in it wit me than you in my way
But either or you will respect mine
And leave tech 9 and leave it for dude
The realest you gonna feel is when you face your death
Sorry I didn't know nigga don't even waste your breath
Copping pleas not D why you flipping
Nigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slipping
Letting a nigga catch you when I got my guard down
So I keep em up
Nodding of with one eye open
I can it freak but there's a time when I'm close 'em both
Lead poisoning I'm a get hit with an overdose
So I don't drug thing crud things
Think I don't know a slug stains, or blood blaze
Raw gun playin drama
Sadness to another Niggas momma
I'm a be the the one that puts you up inside the trauma
These are troublesome times
And the crime prevails
And the dark side keeps a Niggas ass in jail
Bada-boom-bada-bing some of this and some of that
Gotta boogie for a minute but you know I'm coming back

[Chorus: x2]

Try to show Niggas but I can only hope they see
You a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3
Layin' up like this
Lips sewn shut eyes closed
Niggas walk past the casket damn shorty nice pose
You was balling nigga till your ass got balled out
Called out by some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out
I bet you thought it was real funny
Until it had to get cruddy
Me walking off leaving you with all this bloody
What he gonna do when it's all over for real
And the last thing you see is that steel
A blast of light that's what he seein' if you blast him right
Hit him in the face and hear that closed casket tight
Get it right it aint nothing but ending it to a nigga
Street sweeper like
Sending it to a nigga
When you in the house you play by house
2 words you'll never here again are house lose
And that's house choose it ain't gonna be that
Cause I can't see that
Ready to get in them Niggas ass real good so where the weed at
Believe that you ain't going to see nothing to familiar
I would tell you what to do but than I'd have to kill you
And it ain't even worth it I ain't going to build nothing
So I'm just gonna let you go be that same nigga
Still fronting laughing and shit
Like you see something funny but you say sound good
Let me see something money
For real

Figured out the plan, then I started to pray 
And that prayer, took me from here to over there 
Back to over here,

Do I belong? 
Do I fit in? 
Things on my mind, where do I begin? 
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart

I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance, at 27 
No longer afraid to knock on your door 
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war 

After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the lord 
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword 
And now that I've seen, what I need to see 
Please take me, where I need to be

It's better to tell the truth than to lie

To love my life until I die

Violence isn't always the key

You can't always believe what you see

It's better to forgive and forget

Give as you expect to get

Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

I've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there
Now I'ma there sit back and look
At what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit the drama with my Mama
She got on some fly shit so I split
And said that I'ma be that seed
That doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed
And a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Bagging niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Going too fast, it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be living high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only muthafucka I had offered my last
Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit starting shit for kicks
Catching Vicks throwing bricks gettin by being slick
Used to get high to get by used to have to puff my L
In the morning before I get fly
Ate something a couple of forties made me hate something
I did some coke now I'm ready to take something
Three years later showing signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side living the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fucking it up
I'm slippin', I'm falling, I can't get up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talking shit was like damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window
No more endo
Look at a video
Sayin' to myself that could've been yo
Ass on the TV
Believe me, it could be done
Something's got to give
Gots to change cause I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back looking type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothing but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doing wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fucking song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit you'll get yours because it's due

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up

DMX,"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF
Too late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four, with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles (What you want me to do?) Beep Carlos
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, ""Yo, get in! You drive""
""What the fuck you doing nigga?"" ""Tryin' to stay alive""
Cops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by
Who the fuck could'a snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take the niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch (Like you said nigga, almost)
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
""Drop it on the floor""
Boom, got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is what about my kids
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm going out fast and the last thing I hear is
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF",ATF
DMX,"You tell me that there's love here
But to me it's blatant
Nothin' but all the blood here
I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hate
It's hard to keep peace (Uh huh)

Thou shall not steal,
But I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but
Good's not too good for me
Misunderstood,
Why you chose the hood for me
Mean I'm aight,
I just had to work hard at it

Went to grandma for the answer,
She told me that God had it
So now here I am,
Confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose
Or is this just a lesson

And who it's goin' choose
When it gets turned around
And will it be
Layin' in my own blood
And on the ground

My child,
I watched you grow up
And I've been there (Uh huh)
Even at those times
You least suspected it I was there

And look at what I've given you
A talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call,
But I'm always on time

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin',
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin',
But where will it end

But when the funds are low
The guns will blow
Lookin' for that one that owe,
Make 'em run that dough

No!
Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time
You'll do fine
Just have faith
'Cause you mine (Uh huh)

And when you shine
It's gon' be a sight to behold.
So don't fight to be old,
Or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road,
It's goin' guide you there
Two sets of footsteps,
I was right beside you there

But what about them times
I only saw one
Those were the times that I was under the gun,

It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety
It just wasn't your time to face me (Uh huh)

Ah-yo a few of them times I thought you would erase me
But all you did was embrace me
Prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal light,
And scared me with the hearse

And the curse
Turned to grace
When the hurt, turned to faith
No more runnin', (Uh huh)
Slidin' in the dirt
'Cause I'm safe

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin,
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in

So if I'm yo' man
I'm in yo' hands
What's yo' plan?
Never had a friend
'Cause you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled
Things were twisted!

And if you showed me anything at all
Then I missed it
Looked the wrong way (Uh huh)
I've done some wrong things (True)
Kept a bad attitude,
But that's what wrong brings

And now you mean to tell me that
After all this time,
It was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind.
It was you that breathed life
Into my lungs when I was born

And it was you that let me know
What was right,
From what was wrong
And it was you that let me do
What I knew what could be done

And it was you that gave me a good wife
And a beautiful son
And it's been you speakin' to me
Inside my mind
And it's been you who has forgiven
Time after time

It was you who opened my eyes
So I could see
It was you who shined yo'
Light on me",The Convo
DMX,"Who is this I see, coming through, it's like 3 on the a.m
I'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I reach 'em
Like Jigga said, ""Niggas test you when your gun goes warm""
So I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light come on
From night 'til dawn, right from wrong, hold no weight
3-57 slugs with a snub nose, trey eight
Settin' all them issues straight, squashing all beefs
To the point where the police was lockin' all streets
They got me trapped off in the building, but you know how that go
I stay fucking with the hood rats, I run up in the rat hole
Run through the hallway, see police, face to face
And being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case

It's either you or me
And more than likely, it's gonna be you, than me
Aiight? Feel me yo

Day 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues
Waking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window
Plus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case
When they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face
""What a waste of potential"" is what my teachers used to tell me
""You can always get a job"" and peep shit they tried to sell me
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name, and niggas know my name
Knock of the door ""Police! We're looking for a man,
Who killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand""
I play like a bitch ""Its just me here, and I'm not dressed
And that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest""
It was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city
'Cause I know I'm hotter than lava, I'll holla tomorrow
Hit my dog on the horn, he like ""Fuck, you done did?!
They done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!""

Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind, no half steppin'
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it,
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', remember me as the nigga that died gunnin'
Kamikaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint, raw dog, fuck the vest
They can keep theirs, because it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the raw, or the C-4 as I'm bringin' down the building
When I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckers with me
I ain't sitting around waiting for them fagot niggas to come and get me
I bring it to 'em, service with a smile
What nigga? Didn't know a dog with rabies was in the cut, nigga?
Now that you finally findin' out what this shit means
I'm at the precinct, 116th
Run up in there
Open up my jacket ""You motherfuckers lookin' for me?""
Well here I am ""Now you comin' with me""",Crime Story

You got niggas coming? Where they at? Right where?

What do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat?

Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas, it's like
""Protected by viper, stand back.""
What's that? I thought you niggas was killas, demented
Fuck you want me with this coward?
Finish him, it's ended",Get at Me Dog
DMX,"Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your heads
Cats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Shut the casket door, this one here, it is done
And thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It's comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an him 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me and he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin', up or down what have you been provin'?
Just that you a fuckin' clown
Bitch seen through the bullshit, but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I would of traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

There's a lot of shit that I let slide, 'cause its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
And a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, feedin' them to the morgue
Full moon, the howlin',
The growlin', and prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know, why you bad in your house
When they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide,
But you an I both know the truth, fool would never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
'Cause you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on

DMX,"One two one two, come through run through
Gun who, oh you don't know what the gun do
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest
Rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill, is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefing but a lot of them bluffing
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?'
The battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy
But I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog bite
Biting whatever, all up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that
And ain't no love I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back (Clack, clack)
Close your eyes baby, it's over
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin' but
Nobody knows who did it
(What)
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?

Niggas is pussy
Keep 'em running from the Werewolf, oh
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get 'em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back, strike back
Left him like that, laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes
Hitting niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
'Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He ran through like 20 G's, thought that I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinking and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinking
Blowing up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dead
Four squared box
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob
That nigga DMX is a motherfucking problem
Alright",Intro
DMX,"Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want to play with me, wanted to show me how
No meow, 'cause its all about the bark
Let the dog loose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
'Cause why? And you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't trying to go, you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence 'cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barking up the tree for the cat
In the fog but y'all niggas see is the bat
Flapping away but I'm blind like Stevie
Niggas don't hear me, still trying to see me
Stop being greedy, you heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on

Either let me fly, or give me death

If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
And yo it's cold on this level 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it, then it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Let's keep it fair baby
Put me in the air, and I'll take it there baby (Yes)

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit he hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was cold
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that if taken away, you'd of missed it?
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I really say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is, eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'mma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day

DMX,"Yo, ay yo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole comity like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead with the bullshit you blab about going through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in yo' spot
Who sit next to you? Protecting you?
But they'll murder you, player
Don status, nigga we getting chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting in eclipses

Yo, Mase and The Lox
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The rack of sing-sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays with niggas names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a Tec at Mase, and, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it

Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas wit a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real, you can feel 'em in your vain
Like Ramello's pops from Sugarhill
J be the 'cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom
You'll see beg niggas pardon, whatever
We can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real big
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green backs from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle
And y'all niggas done started something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'mma makes a lot 'til you rot
And if you a player, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it

Don't came at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck what you heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on yo' toe
Now who gon' tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
What's that?

Surgery with the chainsaw, I hit the fucking streets
'Cause like I said before ain't nothing going down until I eat
Motherfuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, addressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with motherfuckers on all levels
What I'm dealing with is all devils, fucking with snakes
Running wit niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine
Your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck with you
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck with you
And gave it the money
'Cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest
Then I tossed the nine, boss of crime

DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food, let me sleep 
I come to you weak, you give me strength, and that's deep 
Called me a sheep, and lead me to green pastures 
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent 
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try 
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie till I die 
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain? 
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows 
Showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed 
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory 
So it was only right that when you ask for this story 
I put it together to do our dogs some good 
Our dogs being brothers and sisters of the hood 
Plenty of times you should help my way, but I hid 
And I remember once you held me close, but I slid 
It was somethin' that I just had to see 
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be 
And I think I've seen it 'cause I don't feel the same 
Matter of fact I know I've seen it, I can feel the change 
It's strange, but it's got me beatin' down your door 
But I've never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain 
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain 
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone 
I know real, so I wipe away the tear, it's on 
And I almost lost faith when you took my man 
Monte, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan 
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone 
But it's all good 'cause I really didn't expect to live long 
So if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light 
Give me pain till I die, but, please, Lord, treat him right",Prayer (Skit)

You need to go to the Mars or sumthin' like that

You need to get your shit together man
You out here listening to all these niggaz on the corner
Smokin' blunts and 40's, and all that shit
That shit look cool and all that, your head ain't right",The Storm [Skit]
DMX,"Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Burning in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be popping, robbing and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From YO to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flying, up 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, get at me nigga
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
The cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
The calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play rats and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch, didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Give to nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first I'm sold an eight, then told it's not an eight
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me the way
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

And I see the part of your head which used to be your face
Leave you placed by nothin', for bluffin', what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine
Picture that, get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off
Yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggas would have been fucked
But then we in the streets, niggas should haven been stuck you
Plucked you like a chicken, wit' your head cutoff
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cutoff
And as for your man, don't you ever in your motherfuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun, come at me wit' a knife, aight?
And forgettin' you ever saw me is the best thing to do

Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
'Cause I ain't knockin' on the door
I'm comin in the house and I'm gunnin' for your spouse
Tryin' to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older then 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the living room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, what you wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? When they kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a lil' while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, no time before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, motherfucker

I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once, and I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
'Cause where I catch you is where I catch you
That's what killin' means
Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'
'Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'
Niggas started somethin', but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cause I'ma win this shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax

DMX,"What good is it
for a man to, gain the world.
yet lose his own soul, in the process? 
God loves you, yes he does 
Said you're alright with him 
I wonder

[Chorus: x2]
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him 
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him 
Uh, you're alright with him 
I said you're alright with him 

I'm callin' out to you Lord, because I need your help 
See once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself 
behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it 
But every and now and then, gets a little harder to go through
it 
Losin' friends, day by day 
I'm in so much pain when I'm here Lord, please take me away 
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done 
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son 
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars 
But there won't be a, his or hers, just ours 
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you, all these
years 
Do the right thing; cause after the tears, come the cheers 
I will, my Lord, with my heart, and my soul 
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I'm old 
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow 
I'mma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow 

[Chorus]

I want you to know Lord, that for what you've given me I'm
thankful 
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful 
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak 
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach 
Can't tell em nothin' wrong, cause I love em too much 
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch 
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against 
everything I know is right, what I know makes sense 
That's when you must fight harder, than you've ever fought
before 
cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war 
between good and evil, be careful of those who want to be you 
They smile, but are not really happy when they see you 
Be careful of the ones that always want to get you high 
Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die 
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you 
if you want me to help, what do you want for yourself? 

[Chorus] 

My Lord, my saviour, don't judge my behaviour 
but instead, take what's in my heart and put it in my head 
See I guess I really never knew, how proud I made you 
My life is yours, my soul I gave you 
I don't know if I'll do good enough (he's by your side) 
And we both know the hood is rough (right by your side) 
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes) 
But I know what I gotta do (it'll be alright) 
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song 
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong 
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start
of it 
Praises to you my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it 
I was that kid that, been there, did that 
Became ashamed so I hid that 
But, ain't no longer with that 
Use me as an example - if I can do, then they can too 
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do 

[Chorus]
 
He's by your side 
Right by your side 
X, dry your eyes 
cause it'll be alright 
Yeah, he's by your side 
Right by your side 
X, dry your eyes 
Cause, it's gonna be alright

Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie 
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time

Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (hmm)
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uh)
""more money, more problems"" well the fame was worse (uh-huh)
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst (what?)
Blessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me
Niggas don't hear me, y'all niggaz, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? ""niggas don't hear you!"" see that?
You gots to feel me to catch what I'm sayin, believe that (uh!)
But leave that, alone (what?)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (what?)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (uh!)
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
Cause we got the chrome (c'mon!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggas wanna lie for? it changes nothin
I'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (hmm)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (uh)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (uh)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (what?)
Dark man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (uh) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (c'mon) I'm right there

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry

I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (Uh) 
Hit him with work 'cause, yo, that's my little man (Uh-huh) 
He asked a few questions 'bout the game, and I told him (Yeah) 
So when he made a bad move, it was my place to scold him (Aight)

Mmm... 

[Chorus: ] 

I gots to make a move and make it soon,  uhh 
I gots to take a block and make it boom  
I take the car and hit it with this boom 
Now come on let's get that money! 

It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street 
Til I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat 
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle 
Step on toes  strong arm and show a lil' muscle 
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated 
I hate it, seein' crab niggaz that made it 
And I'm robbin' cats just as broke as myself 
Livin' foul and ain't lookin' out for my health, where's the wealth? 

Not in New York, cause niggaz talk about goin' out of state 
Money got an eighth, comin' back, hot with a lot of weight 
Where's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too 
So I'ma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew 

Niggaz that ain't never had, and doin' bad 
Won't be bad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad 
Grab your bags, it's about to go down 
We goin' to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down 

[Chorus: Repeat 2X] 

I gots to make a move and make it soon 
Gots to take a block and make it boom 
We comin' through so make some room 
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up 
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up 
The purple top thirty-five smalls a ring of games? 
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
 
I send two niggaz back up top, and come back 
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop 
It's four in the mornin', we on the block creepin' 
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
 
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler 
Cause nigga if I ain't know you since I was like six 
Then I don't trust ya 
And we'll bust ya over somethin' petty like a few dollars 
Put somethin' hot up in that ass and watch you holla 
You think I'm here for the hoe flow? I want the dough flow 
And fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo' 

[Chorus: Repeat 2X] 

I spend my money on niggaz cause niggaz get me rich 
And a bitch ain't doin' shit but suckin' my dick 
Niggaz is family now, and we stand strong 
Thirty niggaz on six blocks, makin' the cash long 

Shit is good, because niggaz gettin' what they been wantin' 
And we see the same shit, other New York niggaz frontin' 
Stick up kids huntin', but I ain't got no love for em 
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em 

Them motherfuckin' knockers come at us and chop us 
And I know they, really tryin' to stop us and want to drop us 
So we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house 
It's holdin' em strong, it's a stash house 

I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts 
And when them niggaz keep they count correct, I don't riff 
But I ain't tryin' to hear that nigga took your pack shit 
Ain't tryin' to hear jack shit, fuck the black bitch 

I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run 
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun 
Got bitches to transport without an escort 
I'm makin' moves from D.C. up to Westport
 
Local police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us 
It be them ATF niggaz that have you under pressure 
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my glock down (why nigga?) 
Cause I'm a hustlin' motherfucker, and I'm holdin' my block down 

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Make a Move
DMX,"Uhh.. c'mon! 

[Chorus]
It's more to a song than jewelry and clothes 
More to a niggas life than  money and hoes 
The game is a lot bigger than you  think you know 
And if you think you know then I don't think you know 


Niggas walk around fronting talking bout jewels 
How much you bust tools y'all niggas sounds like fools  
Who you really think give a fuck how much your watch cost?  
How much your watch cost? You bout to get your watch lost  

If you flashing it, you must not want it 
See I fuck with real niggas that done it 
You know what time it is, run it! 
Niggas got more important shit to deal with 

Talking about some 4 wheel shit 
But my man here is about to kill shit 
Keep playing niggas pussy, and you will get fucked
Why don't you cop some more ice dog; 

Then you will get stuck and fucked 
Bitch-ass nigga, hit my street 
And see what happens to that iceberg when it's hit by heat  

It won't be a pretty sight, you and your pretty wife 
Oh you must have forgot dog, this is the city life  
Ain't a fucking thing sweet, and ain't nothing fair 
Just another nigga dead, don't a motherfucker care 

[Chorus: x 2] 


Born and raised in the projects and can't forget it 
And all that grimey shit niggas do, I done did it (uhh) 
And I'm still wit it, nigga I stay in the hood 
But when the cats is out, bet the dog, play in the hood 

You keep bringing them fake bitches through 
You gon' fuck around and make bitches do 
We take bitches too
An if you coming through my block, it's gon' be the last stop 
We blast tops, faggots couldn't make it to the stash box  

Big ass rocks, I want that! Fuck the blood 
All that shit washes off, the next day I'm like, ""What?"" 
Flossing yo' shit, what I want for yo' shit?  
Give a nigga like three bricks to feed the dogs with 
Cause I ain't really gots to shine (Why?) When they do, I do 

For me them niggaz will hide you, where nobody willl find you 
If you eating motherfucker, then your dogs should be eating too 
Not just four or five niggas 
Cause you know what the streets will do

[Chorus: x 2]
 
I will be the voice of the street til I die 
Cause I know if I keep my heart real, I'm going fly 
Either let me fly or give me death; if you didn't catch it then 
get it now, cause it's all that's left 

And this will be the last breath (uh) provoking my niggas  
To start choking y'all niggas (WHAT?) and smoking y'all niggas 
A nigga would never have to say, ""X feed me!"" 
You'll never hear a nigga say, ""X is greedy!"" 
Only, ""X believe me! I didn't know it was a setup!"" 
Get up, cock sucking motherfucker, shut up 
Shut up, Fuck you nigga 

From the hood to the wood, fuck you nigga 
This for my dogs, til death do us part 
I'm still here, cause I been here from the start  
If I'm ever anywhere, anytime it gets ugly 
The dog is aight, cause I know the streets love me

But the house is packed, shit, I know he here somewhere 
See, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by 
Just make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with me gettin' mine 
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then

Two stock boys, one at the register, but he count the stacks 
Aight, bitch, put on the ski mask, make sure that when we ask 
For the dough, they know that we takin' all three bags 
See that? We got a hero, shoot that nigga 
Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga 
Hard headed motherfuckers always get it 
I told him what would happen if he moved, the nigga moved, so I did it 
Did you get it? I asked my man as he was comin' from the back 
Nigga opened his mouth, said nothin', and fell out flat 
This cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans 
Couldn't control what was in his hands

Pour out my soul, took control of hurt

DMX,"Let us pray
Lord Jesus, it is you who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love - this is why I pray.
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good.
I influenced so many children; I never thought that I would.
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you, Lord
I'm just the one that's givin' it.
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch.
Lord, I am not perfect by a long shot; I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me.
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart will begin to show.
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, 'cause I'm so tired of the sufferin'.
I stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection
Beggin' for direction; for my soul needs resurrection.
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money.
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only having one life to do it instead of two.
Amen.",Prayer III
DMX,"[Chorus: DMX]
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna, then I'm gonna, 
Cause I gotta, pop, pop, pop, pop (nigga!)

I look through the 11th floor window
Take one last puff of the indo (what?)
Look through the scope, and let like ten go
Break it down, back in the briefcase
Wipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe 
Outside I breathe safe 
Nigga never saw it coming, that's how he got it (what?)
Never even thought of running, cause a nigga plotted (what?)
Smart niggas get niggas killed for real
I know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel (aight)
It's goin' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you 
Stop you in your motherfucking tracks nigga and drop you
Get rid of all the clothes (uh-huh) dump the gun
I hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slugged and run
But I'm on the job and right now there's more niggaz that need to be
Left with a head full of lead, resting easily
And that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use
The only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse (c'mon!)

[Chorus: x2]

[DMX]
I can catch you in the very building that you live in 
Wait until you get right at your door then start spitting (aight?)
Now they got a ribbon tied to the rail at the top of the steps (what?)
I was there, you ain't DIE at the top of the steps (alright?)
I can do that walk behind you shit and follow you home
Make a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (boom!)
Last thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light 
I blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight (c'mon!)
I could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (boom!)
Then make em call, tell em all they found was a piece of your clothes
And a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm
Which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waiting, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat
With some fucking chicken wire, soon as you hit the backstreet
I jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass
Clean up the mess and, get away from the cops

[Chorus: x2]

[DMX]
I could be the UPS delivery boy (uh-huh) or the man
Working at Toys'are'Us handing yo' kid a brand new toy (true)
I could be the one serving your food wherever you go to eat at
Or that nigga on the corner that you ask, 'Yo, where the weed at?'
I could be the one driving the school bus that yo' kids in
Except that, I don't like to involve, women and children (aight)
A nigga got feelings, I just put em aside
And when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride
I don't get much sleep (uh) my soul's tormented (uh)
I wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it
I know I'm doing wrong and everyday I beg the Lord
To forgive me for fucking with the, double-edged sword
Shit ain't going too well, but that's my life
I know I'm going to hell, but that's my life
Sometimes I think what will I do, with my life
Kill nigga kill this is my life

Uh-huh
What the fuck, you forgot about me?
You've been eatin' real good lately
Didn't get a shout out on your last album, what you hate me?

Said I was your dog
Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Arrf
Said I was your mans and them
And any problem that you had I would handle them
Eh yo dog it's like this, I fuck with you lightly (uh-huh)
Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me (uh)
Get mad at me, send niggas wantin' to fight me (uh)
Whole time you fucked with me you didn't like me

Plus you know how shit flow in New York
Walls have ears, buildings heard

Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin' with me

Why you lie? You told me it was Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly arf
Eye for an eye, what happened to my piece of the pie?

Now dog, you know me better than that
I could put you ahead of the pack, instead of the back
I could have niggas sellin' tapes, instead of the crack
Could have niggas fallin' down, with lead in they back
Ain't much that I can't do when I want to
I don't really need you, nigga fuck you
What?
Nah I'm just playin', got a wife and kids
Little Dame ain't come across dem triflin' kid
Yo what you mean by that?
Mean by what?
You is a grimy nigga f'real, I see whassup
I don't even know why I fucked with you from the door
Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I could of got it from him
But you would of hate to wait

So I can't trust you as far as I can throw you (uh)
Oh you, don't know you are the reason

Didn't I promise you again, to slight your friends
Countin' these pairs of Timbs, these endless ends?
But what did it cost me? (c'mon)
My life to be taken softly, man BACK THE FUCK UP OFF ME
Don't fuck with me like that when I fuck witchu like this
Don't come at me like that when you know that you might miss
Go on about your business

DMX,"I know that my savior lives
And at the end, he will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed, yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see him for myself - and I long for that moment

Grandma, I really miss you and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I, hear yo' name
Mariella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't it's like when you left, you took the Lord witchu
Why couldn't I come when he came to get you?
Damn I really miss you I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like ten
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein hard headed
You told me I would get it you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'mma let you know what's been goin on lately
Now you know since you left, a lot of things witcho kids done changed
Yeah Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renee's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's doin real good now, she workin'
Rhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin
Buckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father well, that's somethin' else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)

You left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grandkids
And since then, two of yo' grandkids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right
Xavier's made you a great grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
The lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

I speak for the meek and the lonely, weak and the hungry
Speak for the part of the street that keep it ugly
And niggaz couldn't wear my shoes
'Cause the places that I walk, most catz couldn't bear my dues

Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on
My journey has earned me the right to reach
I burned so I earned the right to teach, what to eat

What niggaz been gettin' fed is pork
What you niggaz been gettin' fed, shouldn't be even on your fork
Let's talk, about this, and about that
Yeah, we like this or we can do it out back

Keep the bullshit for the rodeo
'Cause on the real, you cocksuckers don't know me yo
Hit you wit' something for frontin' that'll end your life
Then hit your crib and bend your wife

Wearin' shit that's costin' too much, how often I touch
I like to break fake niggaz, rape snake niggaz
I take weight nigga, you fake hate nigga

And niggaz and ain't got the balls to say to my face
What you think behind my back suck my dick, how's about that?
Loose lifts is loose clips and crews hit
I run with niggaz from Israel to hijack crew ships

Watch the news at 6, that's how I'm gettin' down
Feds lookin' for the dog, oh that nigga outta town
This is a grown-up game, thinkin' 'cause you got a blown-up name
You won't get a blown-up frame

I ain't playin' wit' you niggaz no more, them are old
I be layin' when you hit the door, you hit it cold
Be like oh no, see what I'm sayin'
I told Money to stop playin', now he layin', we prayin'

Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing

I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing

Oh my God yeah niggaz done lost yo mind
Toss the nine, this nigga done cross the line
Disrespectful shit will get you hit, bitch
Fuck who you with, you niggaz get what you get

Five to the spine, ride now niggaz is dyin'
Money pulled out he was trying, yet to slow wit the iron
Nuttin' but gun firing, blap blap blap blap
Cocksucka where it at

Open up your back now I can see through your stomach
Told stupid muthafucka to stop runnin', or run in
To a buck shot, can't duck off shot
It's that click click boom you outta luck shot

Now don't fall to pieces on me, because the piece is on me
He thought the leash was on me, but dog the streets are hungry
And I'ma feed 'em every time I sing, do my thing

And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God

And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife

Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me

And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya

Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya,

Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear

Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray, so bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin good, I was too proud
And STILL you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin it back
That's somethin new to me, so I'm askin you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I DO!
I guess what I'm askin is - show me how to stand for you
And I will RAP for you, SING for you, PREACH for you, TEACH for you
REACH for you - I will love you like you love me, unconditionally
And I will ALWAYS be prepared, for whatever the mission'll be
GIVE THE NUTRITION TO ME, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, BEFORE I GO, let me give

was like Girlfriend, let me drop a bug in you're ear
she didn't mind 'cause i told her whut she wanted to hear
was like â??Yeah!â?? she knew she was how it was goin down
she said, â??Page me, code zero, 'cause i know you get around!â??
Didn't even have a man, but even if she did then
'cause my game is tight like i stop to cap on a nigga head
i said, woke up, like, 9, or sumthin
don't act like when i say that ass is mine, i'm frontin!
Uhhh that night she let me get that, hit that
ripped that, bounced off the walls and flipped that
But only one thing went wrong 
the rubber bust but i didn't fuss 'cause dogg!!!!
shorty was da bomb!

[chorus]
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
and man the pussy was good
but shorty's fuckin up my life (fuckin up my life)
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night
but man that pussy was good
but shorty's fuckin up my life.... c'mon, ma! gimme a break!

a few days later, i hit her up just to be real
I like, â??Whuttup, Boo, how you been, how you feel?â??
She said, â??Aiight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the thirteenth, it shoulda been here on the eighthâ??
I'm like, â??For real? Well stress a pill 
You better 'cause i can't afford another lil' one.â??
She said, â??Neither can Iâ?? I said, â??Cool 
'cause i got mad shit to do and you still in school
so at least we got the same thing in mind.â?? 
If didn't have this kid, then everything woulda been fine
BUT i was blind! for the fact that she was settin me up for the kill
damn! why wasn't she on The Pill?!
And i still check up on her, like, once a week
sometimes i hit it, sometimes i didn't
but Shorty was a frea, and whenever i would speak
on the baby, she'd be like:
""I ain't havin this kid, is you crazy?!!""

Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
(listen man, only one muthafuckin night!)
And man the pussy was good (i ain't gone front it was good as a muthafucka)
But Shorty's fuckin up my life (man, this bitch is a fuckin headache!)
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night (one muthafuckin night, 
it was nuthin but
trouble)
But Man the pussy was good (The pussy!! Man, let me tell ya....)
But Shorty's fuckin up my life (dogg, man, this bitch....!) 
C'mon Ma, gimme a break!!

By now wasn't lookin too good
'cause she wasn't doin things that she told me she would
like gettin the price checked out for whut we had to do 
and it goes up in the arguements after two
and a half, man i had to laugh at her frustrations
now she's four months ready to hit the bus station
if i was still in that shit wit her made me rob her
told her friends, â??DMX is my baby's father!â?? 
Lil' stomache was showin' so now the heat is on
well maybe we'll see the light if i start to treat her wrong
i guess she thought that if she keeped the baby, she would keep me
got the game on high level, gettin sneaky
had the kid she said it was premature
found out she was six months when she said she was four
so i left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
she'll be aiight 'cause shorty was da bomb!

Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
(man one muthafuckin night? Get real!)
and man the pussy was good (the pussy it ate the dick up like THAT!)
but shorty's fuckin up my life (This bitch won't quit CALLIN'!!!!)
Shorty..... UHHHH!! (she was kinda cute though) we only did it full that night 
(it only takes one night, man, hehehehe)
but man that pussy was good (Mmm Mmmm Mmm!!!!)
But Shorty's fuckin up my life C'mon, Ma! Gimme a break!!",Shorty Was da Bomb
DMX,"Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why the lights are out
Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder, what the lies are about
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why, I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I, get on that bullshit and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's yo' man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't wit it
Sometimes the pain is too much to bear
Sometimes it rains too much to care
Sometimes if you, don't watch yo' back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder, who would give a fuck if they lost you
Yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock
But sometimes it's dark, and hell is hot",Sometimes

Money went up against the dog, read about it
Man listen, you cats better walk easy
I'm on some positive shit but I still walk greasy

and give brothers a job that really want one

The jerk, the fame, the work, the game (uh!)
The friends, the foes, the Benz, the hos (what!)

First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life

Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with ""Oh, you ain't got?""
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'ma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg 'til I find
Strapped 'til I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, 'cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
Some of you niggas, form a following, but you startin' to forget

But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes

Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
'Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thoro nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, ""Yo, that's my dog""
To, ""Yeah, that nigga dead""
What the fuck is all this?

Misery, love, company

Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes
Live life through life, and so on and so on
That's when the grow on, man, get your flow on

You don't know? fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem, I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car

Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than 'cause
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm goin' die by it cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B.
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga!

[Chorus]

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for

[Chorus: x2]

Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
You want to start something, it's goin' be somethin'
You want to start something, it's goin' be somethin'
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
You want to start something, it's goin' be somethin'
You want to start something, it's goin' be somethin'

Started gettin a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin
Guns got the clappin, another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin, another bit by the dog
When there's nothin left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin
Killin other dogs got you cats chasin bitches
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within
What I catch I'ma eat, in the streets I'ma win
I've been top dog and I'ma stay top dog
So what the fuck you got to say dog?
You cats play games that dog ain't with
Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to clamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch

I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggaz don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggaz you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggaz like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't want to see your man missin, man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggaz be like ""X I thought I was your man!""
Not!

Yea what black
Don't nothin move less
Dog say so

At least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill
'cause they feel dog
I can't help what it is
Shit is real dog
You must have thought that
It was a joke or somethin
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin
Now hold up playa
'cause I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit

See what I know I'm taking
To the fuckin grave

But you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood

I wish you woulda listened

That it's only right
To give a dog a bone

Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla want to shake my left hand
When a nigga follow 'cause he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow 'cause he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
In to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast
That's the lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door
Shhh chill
You sit right there
I'm gonna answer that

Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know, fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down

They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand em, fake-ass niggas want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute

Father thank you for makin me righteous
And accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection
Your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favorite shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special privileges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything
That the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries
And an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turn-arounds and miraculous breakthroughs
In the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws
Are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight
Because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time the designated moment
For me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf

Get the drum crack four bars, horn then loop it
Same shit that you did to me, took what you did

Dog done did it again, uh uh (WHAT?)
Dog is in it to win, uh huh (WHAT?)
Dog did a nigga and then, uh huh (WHAT?)
You thought dog was afraid? Nah ah (Come on)

[Chorus]

My niggaz, some niggaz you don't want to try
But then again, I be that one to bust a nigga in his eye
I don't give a fuck bitch all my niggaz ready to die
Hit you with the things so you niggaz ready to fly
You don't want no more
Bring all ya got to even the score
E5 is HOT? You want more?
You really don't know what you're askin' for
Listen old man, don't do that
We all dogs over here, don't act like a cat
We like, touch balls, round table with a bat
Start with the cheers, ""Crack, crack, crack!""

The gate's wide open and the dog's off the chain

I be that yung'n with that gun-ness, tellin' ya stop frontin'
I be that yung'n on the run, after I pop some'n
In the Bible I read, death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Dave taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on e'ry nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say sak passe nap boule and rob niggas
The media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, whats up with that?
See my flick, next to bring Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
X what up? (aight!)

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you SHOT, DOWN

Now we meet again, it's all good my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood my nigga
Knock on wood my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard (aight?)
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'ma make you remember, where you know my name from (YYea!)

Niggas like me might rush your apartment (word)
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I don't want the throne or the crown, I ain't sellin up
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough

There would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win
In the name of Jesus
I lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life
In the name of Jesus
When I save a thousand two or save ten
So I thank the lord for my wife
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you what you showed me what you told me
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you for your love and watchin over me

Whatever it was right or wrong

Baby in the spirit, let me go

Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

We built this Double are thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!

Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out

Come on fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9

Double are and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
What! We untouchable, alright?
Yea, WHAT!

Paul bearers'll carry you

To the cemetery where your momma goin' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees

Then it's me against the world, man against machine

My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus]

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch

I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies

My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)

Randy a** was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say, I'm crazy
If you ask me, I'll say I'm what the hood made me

Now, I can stunt 'til my a** dead broke like Jay-Z
Or put a hundred grand on every n**** head that play me
See, I'm cool with them Hatian mob n****z
Tu say sapa say mavule, and rob n****z

Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seein the light, but lived in the dark

Was a pride brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So I gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us

DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired
You give food and let me sleep
I come to you weak
You give strength and that's deep
You called me a sheep
And led me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus
Between the chapters
You give me the word and only acts I interpret
And give me the eyes so I can recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'll like me to try
And just like the devil who wants me to lie
Till I die
Lord why is it that, that I go through so much pain
All I saw was black and all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you that knows
To show me that everything is black
Because me eyes were closed
You give me the light and let me bask in your glory

So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put together to do all dogs some good
All dogs being all the brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hid
I remember once you held me close but I slid
There was something that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I am seeing it but I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I have seen it I can feel the change
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears son
And I almost lost faith in you when you took my man Monty
Pass over chase a brother down
And I fear that what I saying won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, Cause I didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer for me brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die but please lord treat him right",The Prayer IV [DVD]

I don't have to walk to it anymore

I don't want to find a piece of the sword
I can't afford to

When every day of my life is a constant fight between wrong and right

Showed up at the federal court in Queens Wednesday
To accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse, D-M-X signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face
As well as the fans caught off guard
By this star's appearances

[Chorus]
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin' with that bitch no more""
Don't even like so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin' cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
(Repeat)

My baby's motha be buggin', she wanna blast stick bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, y'all niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's oh-five, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin' through that riffin' shit cousin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin' at me
You listenin' thinkin' that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin' with his baby motha

[Chorus: x2]

Bitches be callin' the cops, thinkin' they callin' the shots
Takin' the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops
And do yo thing, cause I'm doin' mine boo
A nigga just been chillin', I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin'
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin' clothes
When them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin' on the Guess
Askin' for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't goin' blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'm a always hit that

Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never gon go away (You won't)
I'm a stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin' for you to come out
Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin' stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch

[Chorus: x2]

My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin' with this bitch no more""
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like ""Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck""
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin' through, she comin' through with that twenty-two
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh y'all bitches already know, I got a wife
You's a stupid bitch, a real fuckin' stupid bitch
You ain't nothing but a stupid bitch. Bitch!

Didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick, half gas, half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic, if I didn't, I was bad

Took it out on my regulars, I come through
And if niggaz was broke, I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was, how not to be sloppy

An older cat robbed me when I was like ten
If anybody wanted to help, they should've did it then

Give up the money, the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play, let's get popped
See how much fun you having, when your heart be stopped

But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin' it out, we out

Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

So young, so gifted
Direction of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted
And took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse
A nigga stressin took the dog into the hearse
My nigga Divine was way too young to die
Fell out the nest and was way too young to fly
But that didn't stop fate from happenin
Idle time make the Devil HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
God no! Why did it go that way?
Comin from his fans away, why did he go that day?
Lightly, I dare say, life goes on
Donuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong
He was supposed to be on the road with me
I wish somebody WOULDA came to get me and niggaz woulda had to hit ME
But until then, MY FRIEND
I'ma say goodbye today, cause you never know when

Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

Goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
Goin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)
Goodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today
Go on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'ma say goodbye today
I'ma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!
Yes (yeah!)
I mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)
We are born, to die, so LET ME FLY! (know what I mean)
Let me fly, we are born, to die (be good)
{""Sometimes the pain is too much to bear"" - [repeat to end of Outro]}
Cause I'm in a better place ('til we meet again)
I'm in a better place (I don't know what form)
See you soon baby! (we'll meet again)
Ha ha! .. (But we will meet again)
...
Spread your wings (they gon' shed a tear on this one!)
Fly, I'll try not to cry, it'll be hard
I just, miss, not havin you here
Even though I know you're in a better place!
I just miss not havin you here

Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it

Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin' all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And I'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

[Chorus]

I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas

DMX,"We all got guns, we all got dogs
We all gon' make that trip to the morgue
We all find it harder to see through the fog
We all know the difference between right and wrong

We should all live life by one fact
Before you doin' dirt, the dirt gon' come right back
I seen cats go out like suckers
I seen cats get down like, ""Yo, them some bad ***""

I see fake niggaz and the games they play
Yo, I deal with that *** e'ry day
Ain't gon' stop me from doin' what I'm doin'
I got things beside *** to be pursuin'

It's that craft for me, the half of me
Let through niggaz in the door after me
Yo, somebody stop me, please, somebody come and get me
If I go, I'm takin' niggaz with me

Dog, nigga, Ghost, nigga
Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

Dog, nigga, Ghost, nigga
Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

Nigga, f*** the cop and the warrant
You get a chance, pop an informant
All I need is a *** and I'm torment
Hit every hole in the wall, have me a ball
And then slide the f** out in the top of the mornin'

If you hear me *** it on 'em, I'm poppin' it on 'em
I don't *** around nigga, better stop it and mourn 'em
And who the *** asked you to rhyme?
I'm the Ghost, when I come around
They throwin' up the hazardous sign

And you ain't around chemicals, just around generals
Who spend, passin' they time, blastin' they ***
Rather die with my man then the five for ya livewires
Spend half of ya time, smashin' ya spine

Other half, we gettin' money and more money
You think about cars, I got 'Goin' to war' money
We gettin' that dog money
We still in the front of the store, money
And if anybody slip, they gettin' 'Sent to the morgue' money

Dog, nigga, Ghost, nigga
Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

Dog, nigga, Ghost, nigga
Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

It's like lately I've been feelin' so weak at the knees
And speakin' to niggaz is just like speakin' to thieves
So I keep the hawk ready to eat 'em
Guess already? Then meet 'em
I'm fair game but I'm ready to cheat 'em

The streets ain't right now, the *** white is light brown
These niggaz ain't nice, they nice clowns
That's why I'ma start layin' them right down
And have 'em there layin' in the casket, ice down

Jacob watch on 'em, mortician must've been hazed up
'Cause you can see the makeup spots on 'em
This is way beyond ya Evian
The Golden King, it's more like Polo Spring

And what makes it even worse, yo, it's that it's personal
Maybe even ya earth can go
I'll make it where they can never find the ***
Right outta the bar, with all kind of ***

Dog, nigga, Ghost, nigga
Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

Hop the bar with the toast, nigga
It's like the Lord gettin' close, nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggaz
It's personal, now we gotta host niggaz

Yeah, y'all niggaz can get caught up in the hype if you want
Bodies drop over here, this is not a game, man
You wanna get caught up in the hype again
Then you can fall in the hype again

This is a movement, Double are, nigga, you know what's up
And if you don't, you gon' get to know what's up
Yeah, we ain't playin wit y'all niggaz this year
'06, '07 and on, nigga, what's up?

DMX,"Ask me if I cry
I'll tell you why I can, come on

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong

I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

How I live is simple, walk through the streets
Talk to the beats, New York, I'ma eat
I ain't never had a problem with survivin'
No problems with gettin' down, bustin' my *** or Ruff Rydin'

Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My *** for real 'cause I'm that ***
Reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the Lord, no one, only He can solve 'em

See what I see but look through my eyes
The Devil is a liar, the truth never lies
We all got issues, s*** that we go through
S*** that we been through, s*** that we won't do

The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me and in the process
I lost my soul, damn, Devil got a hold

In my mind, I'm like a little boy lost in crime
Like the healthy *** that the Devil forced into dyin'
Lord knows I'm tryin' but at the same time
You hit a *** with the weight of the world
Why you gave it to Earl?

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on

I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

To live is to suffer and I'm livin' it up
Face everyday chin up, I ain't givin' it up
If I ain't givin' a ***, then who will?
So I hope for the best, knowin' that it's all uphill

Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out and no doubt
The fate is mine is blind
So whatever, *** it, I'ma roll out

We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown in or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far

You don't know what to say when you talkin'
We don't know who you gon' see when you walkin'
If you don't know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you don't know could get you hurt

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on

In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, verse 15
do not love the world or anything in the world
and we know what that means, but listen
We know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen and amen",The Prayer VI

For bitch ass (niggas) to fool my (niggas)
Drinkin' daily, old ceiling leakin'
Men seem tense still smokin', drinkin'
Hammers ready for them billings
Tryna creep up in my building
Drunk ass bitches, what's the matter with your mind?

What type of games are being played, how's it going down?
It's on till it's gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me, or what? They gon' try to give me a nut
Just honeys want to give me the butt, what?

I'm politicking with this chicken, wondering if I'm a creep her
Little hood rat bitch from 25th named Tamika
Coming through, like I do, you know, getting my bark on
Knew she was a thug 'cause when I met her, she had a scarf on
Fifty-four, eleven, size seven in girls
Baby face, would look like she was eleven with curls
Girlfriend, (what), remember me from way back; I'm the same cat
With the wave cap, the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them doing they thing on 35th Ave.
It's a small hood, and it's all wood, so let me get that number, hook it up, a'ight
Hit you on the jack later on, see wassup
Talking to shorty made me want to do something nice
Looking at that ass made me want to do something tonight
And I know right when I see right; shorty lookin' like she tight
She bite, better give a nigga the green light; we might...

[Chorus x 2]

I'm getting at shorty, like what you need, what you want?
Offer nothing 'cause I got you, but you frontin'
I see you with your baby father but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is getting fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I done kept it more than real, Boo, can't lose with me
Heard he smacked you 'cause you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on TV
Try to creep me? (What?) Leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, and that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go, take this snow up to one-five-oh, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, and we can split that, sit back, fuck, puff a L, forget that
You wit' that?

[Chorus x 2]

Hey yo, this chicken got me digging her moves 'cause she smooth
Win to lose, whoever she choose gets the dues
Respect is not expected but it's given 'cause it's real
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Putting something in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me, kill for me
You still with me 'cause we get down like what
Told you it's from the dog, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, try to be there; we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, Boo, that answer gon' be ""yeah""
See there, something can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go; but it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me
Had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be, best of friends (Ha ha)
Mad love, Boo, to the end (Ha ha)

DMX,"[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

When I think I don’t deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I’m worth it
I know I got a purpose
So when I don’t like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look passed the surface
Believe me God heard this,
'Cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it’s gon’ get greater, later
God only wants the best for me
But the devil’s a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If yall think hate wins just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who’s will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes true
The spiritual individual within you

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

Lord if you hear me,
You know that I’m coming to you sincerely
I need you near me, please feel me
I’m sick and I need for you to heal me
I’m lost and looking for the real me
I’m tired and weary
Haven’t been able to see things clearly
And even though I know you love me dearly
I still get leery
So where does that leave me?
Lost and alone
I wanna call God but it’s like I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God
'Cause only he could solve them
I’m tired of lying to myself
Thinking I could do it on my own
When I get left alone
When the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly than peeks in
And it’s usually around the weekend
Then I get reckless and jump off the deep end
Come on

[Chorus: x4]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

You didn't bring me this far to let me go

[Chorus: x2]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky",Head Up

You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick

Or you can do is watch me die
You don’t wanna watch me try
So watch me fly!

Do my thing from that big stage in the sky

Bursts of sewing machine gun fire
From your position
Barricaded behind the piano

I return with small arms
Stuttered shots from typewriter keys

And yet in the silence
Between the volley
The hearts of weary camps
Sing to each other

""However faintly
As we each seek to claim
Disputed territory""

The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other

The us beneath the other

Chorus: 

Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow 

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 

Verse Four: Nard 

Now for some typical reason I'm rollin up with a hoe 

and I'm pattin my back seat 

I pimp lyrical tactics like a dirty kid flippin on a mat 

never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit 

Then be dip through the Chi and enjoy my Lexus 

Better blow when you bob your head, to the fed shit 

Why you waitin for the next kid, motherfucker

Get my girl in bed 

Spend my money in the Southern, motherfuckers 

that's thuggerin, but I'ma come from the heart for start 

to stop all the niggaz the bigger the trigger the larger the dividends 

Pimpin and paperin leavin sugar in 

Till money flow like a dreamland 

But really though, could you tell me how the money flow? 

Chorus: 

Don't you know, how the money flow 

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 

Don't you know, how the money flow

Do or Die,"Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse One:

I need...mo money mo money mo, suck 'em fast suck 'em slow
Even though I gotta pay my bills I'm still on the streets
tryin' to keep it real
Pass that shit let me take a hit, hopin' this money ain't
counterfeit
Give 'em 211 get 'em in line and let 'em 20 so(?)
Cut that money let's be up, which you want to ride, the
Benz or the Truck
Back up, get on the one way 'cause more Sundays hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, gotta get away by hittin them blocks
Got my glock, never stick middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from I'm known to clown
Get a dub off a nine, go get a sack, I'm back, pro black
achiever, leave her, thug and ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene, let in the wonder
let all the smoke out
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so I Z's for bud in
the breeze, ain't spittin' cheese
What a freak want to trip off, sip off the lame with the
game, get sick of the man who point the blame
Still a P-O, P-I,M-P, we be P-A,P-E-R...chase

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 2:

You see my nice Mom smokin', money slopin' 'tween my fo
with open arms when my option is to my mission it's a paperchase
So when you face to face: mom and dollar, keep to the
streets, hit the joints like hollow
Boy better figure if you owe them, better low then
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
a couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, nigga didn't want to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga want to go there
The game treatment so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me I'm brutal, choppin'
up that paper like you know
Gotta click since I call them blue notes
Shippin' that paper from Earth to Pluto
Get that new song
Nineteen ninety-six we be paperchasin'!

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 3:

I'm...checkin' paper like a hunter, Belo
Had dreams about runnin' four to the floor
O.G.s in my house me in the clause
Nigga want cheese, nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit 'cause all the good shit makes
you forget about the bad bit
Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, 'cause I never had shit
The basketball, the all, the ounce, bounce, A to the motherfucking K
I smoke the bead but they keep on calling me and they
want my apology
And they fall, see it's unexplainable how money's unattainable
if you play in this game
So nigga never call me names when I aim the gun but holler:
A to the motherfucking K with a motherfucking spray-ay-ay
A to the motherfucking K with a spray-ay-ay
It's 95 keep your ass out the line-up
Why don't you keep the double-time up, pimp keep them lines up
Help 'em talk to shiner, give me the best wish
The paperchase be for me 'cause you got blasted with
an eighth of a key
Niggas be be-comin' up but come or stay away
And I'll let you take your fate with three...
Bullets to the chest, put your body rest
If you know P-gang going for the G-Style
Never relax, realize don't give a one-too-many free packs
Come check your ho to see I'm a G
I-get in a sick dream
Paid to pick teams in a room full of dick fiends
Much love to thugs who sacrifice their life to get greens
for the troop of 15, what the shit mean?
It's you bitch, you better save your breath, 'cause you
can't count how many days is left
Let the weed smoke, blaze, but check, until I'm ready to wreck
Then a motherfucker gonna be paid to death
Because I'm goin' on a paperchase

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase",Paper Chase

Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the bead, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections

'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes

Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game

And I'll be flipping through the bud and holsters
Search all the working with all with working with no love and pop that ass with one slug, ugh

So that they ready to fall and put some names across the wall
How do it feel when you fucking with those veterans
They told the men shut down his body now we back again
With about 10 plates to make you vomit in your own hands
You and all men momma say stay outta the business of grown man

Catch me in the game for 8 years
So watch my nigga catch stripes
In the middle of the night
Seein' fiends smoke pipes
Dub sacks an Coniac
Helps me deal with these phonies
Busters sellin' for G's that I stack
From the back to ponies

And hidin' shank's under they mattress

Steady use of prison
Took another brothers man hood

Although I did comp out the boot-camp
Fly to give a brotha seven
Years of prison teirs

Should be life of what a thug lives
My only hurt
Maybe won't be my last
But here's a tip for these cops
Next time I'm goin' out with a blast

Tell Uncle Sam that I'm gon stay black
And fuck those silly cars stirring my shit up under this six flat
And tell them hoes who be diamond kissers
Trying to take control of a niggas riches
They can get they nose out a niggas business for it
Down here treying to set the wife off the fix and I don't play that
Praying for my downfall I'm making

[Verse One]
I see lookin all good with a see-through dress on, nails pressed on
Get your flex on, like fuckin off that song

By the way you thinkin you gotta peel with it
But if you can't deal with it
It's all cirentricals baby you ain't real with it
If you down then we'll feel it
But that's all them lils said
But licks told we can pick up the looks to the field yo
We can party with P.T.s on T.P. with a tub of hennesse
Three hoes screamin 'cause they straight out da hood
Chi-town pimps that all it took
Better yet we can say this party booked
Let's ride to the corner and get some more
On the way back we can pick up some hoes
Show em how to talk em out of their clothes
Handle some freaky shit behind those
See how the pimp be peeped with them flow
Do or Die's all I know
Make em do shit they ain't did before
Number one rule, don't kiss them low
Lemme do my pimp hard

Ain't trippin' got to split up the front
Approach you with a limp while I hit on the blunt
Your pager goin' off (oh, that ain't nothin')
Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin'
Blow to the bone as I clicked on somethin'
Tryin' to cut me up, yeah the trick's on somethin'
The corner of the party where the niggas stay bumpin'
This is for the gin and the hen in my stomach
I'm lookin' at the do' females still comin'
Lookin' to my left and the B's still comin'
Lookin' to my right and the drinks still comin'
Tryin' to shake the dice but the girl lookin' cunnin'
Circlin' the do' where the money start runnin'
Took a pause, hey y'all whats up
Head hunters in the double-R, is it a double car
Pulled over to the car
So I, asked Proceeds, to pass the B's, no bitch

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's

Choppin' up tens and twenties, mm!
Lean back in the corner with the dob hat
Now my nature is to ball like a democrat
In the club with hoes, and I suppose
That I've been chose, the nigga with the hoodrat
Mm, mm, mm, mm, got it down pat
You call her what you want or even all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm here just to ball black
Gettin' paid in the game bend a row free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
AC, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm makin' money in a row friend
Nickle dime if no fiend don't approach me
If you do, we could have sex, in the Caddy or Lex

But now I'm stackin' C-notes, still dope
Different strokes, same folks, hangin' from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back and like a picture take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another bad boy, playa pimpin' to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shorty what's the deal?

I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with peas and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fiends drip, ours is full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
No more servin' the rock 'caine, the night-game
Flippin' flows like hoes which is a drop-game
It's like, aw suki suki now, lookie here
Stick a phrase while I trades on my hog road
Divine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin' and she peepin' that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin',
Peepin' the Mediterranean try to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin' cold women
Bendin' and grinnin my hair spinnin'
While we smokin' on Henny, still po pimpin'

Do you wanna ride, slip-slide in your thighs
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience 

No second chances 

'cause in this game no one advances 

You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances 

No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks 

To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot 

With a 357 slug pointed at your nose 

Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes 

You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior 

Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer 

Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners 

Leave it in blood Hare Krishna

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go

When they see I got a star, they pause and they react quick
I'm immune to the hot shit, nevertheless
Shitty just beware of where the hat fit
Yo pimp where the plastic?
This pimp, real pimp, it's the pimp like a maverick
Playerism is a habit
I'm at the club wit 'um wit Crystal, what what

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Lil' baller be me, can't see me
Never get her with a TV, cause we be
In the five-double-oh, posed with the clothes
Dyslexic on the passenger side
Don't mean that I ain't got the keys to ride
She's the pie, my, my, my
We done came to fuck and get gone, pay no bills
Flex the mind to make the bank to bounce
Nigga bounce shit like the Dirty South
Watch that shit with a dirty mouth
Know you ain't mad, ain't splurging out
But if ya heard me out, on the passenger side
Care to bore me with the rest of the guys?
Spitting blunts, dropping jewels
Spitting at hoes, that'll be cool

[Johnny P]
Pay no bills, pay no bills
Pay no bills, pay no..,
I gotta keep it real, so I can't pay this here
Why you all up in my grill?
You can tell me about it, to pay the bill, pay the bill

Chorus
[Johnny P]
I got to keep...

[Outro]
One time, uhh... from the real, Do or Die see'mon
A-Rock, uhh.. Back-Pack, Jack-of-Love
Uhh uhh, Johnny P
Uh.. down - like - that - what?
Keep it real baby, 2000, millennium, we gone",Keep It Real
Do or Die,"[Chorus: Repeat 4x]
Gotta make the paper 
Can't let the paper make me
La di da di da di da

Thug come up in a fresh white Benz
Baby mama talkin' crazy cause I'm high again
Flow like a motherfucker say it again
Twenties lookin' like ooh
With the guy like who
Back up the bad money,put it in cruise
Got's new jeans, suits and Timbaland boots
Get off em', '92, all why'all ball
You playin with me, yo, I'm ballin' for all

[Chorus:]

In 96', ok, we made the m-o-n-e-why again
M-o-n-e-why, do you see what you like?
Flashin' cars, worries gone,??
Never went to my head, 'cause I stacked em', yo
Maxed a ho
You could roll by,I lock the door
La di da di da di da, I got a lot for sure
Ho, I make the paper, I don't let it make me
I stay runnin' through my hood, I don't let it break me
I work to get my cheddar, I ain't get it for free
You can do the same, I do so,so why you hatin' on me?
It be, 99' we ridin' in Benz, expo
For the one solo, we ballin' in twins
Right up again, we love em, I said it before
Stack your paper when you make it, it be money galore
Let em know, for those who be round my door
If it ain't about the dollar, then it really ain't low

[Chorus:]

In my early life,they told me I was chasin' a dream
Because I wanted everything that I seen on the screen 
Big home, diamonds, furs,and even them drop tops
I went from ??, little red model and I-Roc
I used to, drive my friends, to rollerskating, use my vocal chords
Choosin' ya know, now I'm on the production board
Took the Benz down until my feet touched the ground
And when the heat touched the ground, they had to sit me down
But the problem changed now
At first I started hustling, fuck struggling
I rather throw bricks, steady smuggling
I was down for an ounce, seven years no parole
It's bad and it's cold,mature getting old
And if you didn't know,now you know
Easy gettin' slow, now I'm gettin' paid for my show

[Chorus:]

Chicago, can we make g's?
Houston, can we make g's?

Cleveland and New York, can we make g's?

Yo, I know niggas that kill
Niggas that dump pills
Niggas that ill
Niggas that don't feel
No remorse like mil for a bitch like you
I'm a Outlaw
What the fuck you thought I would do?
Elaine told me
Never let a fiend hold me
These streets is like hockey
And Kadafi the goalie
Know me
I'm too holy
You too phony
And too bony Tiger
Step in with two Tony's
With two chrome heats
Aimed at your dome-piece
It's all til we deceased
As long as we agree
It ain't a war
If there ain't no blood
Motherfucker
You ain't an Outlaw
If you ain't no thug
Middle fingers up
Wave 'em from side to side
Ride or die Do or Die
Outlaw for life
Middle fingers up
Wave 'em from side to side
Ride or die Do or Die
Outlaw for life
Thug it out.

It's a ship it up yo flip
You see them dogs in me
Automatic static
Outlaws call on me
You see the balls on me
I'm gonna let 'em swang
Without them thangs
So if them cops rush them lanes
Put their names up the wall
Exactly where you left the green stacks
Money from the refs
Like you stackin' from that caine
If it's bullshit we'll set it off
If it's a full clip I'm gonna let it off
From L.A. to Chi-town
From Jersey to the black grounds
We'll shut this whole bitch down

[Chorus: Young Noble]
Who wanna bomb first?
Then the rest gonna follow
We livin' for today
We might not make it to tomarrow
Bore in your heart
Or insides hollow
If you wit me take a swallow
We drink from the same bottle
We share the same pain
This ain't a fair game
From your hood to my hood
It's never gonna change

While we sip on Hennessey hit the speed in the cut would you come come come
would you come come come would you come come come

[Verse 1]
3 double O AM she step into my x-5 beamer
You should have seen her
With a rubber perfection you can put it in a session with Janet Jackson
Little league the chemistry was up to satisfaction
With a magnificent ark spark bringing flame like a arsons
I locked the door and drove off and I drove off kind of slowly
Cause the popo's always blow me
And this is what she told me, she put her lips to my ear move closely
When we got into traffic she indicated what she working with and put her
lips around my LORD HAVE MERCY
I drove and watch, I watched them grow, I spit my hen, I smoke my dro.. shit
In between conversations she was like....she was like...oohhh oohh ooh oh oh ooohhhh
You already know, she was already blown, she was already gone
She was already sprung gone with her tongue uh huh uh huh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Late at night all alone dream of you in those thongs, girl I wake up in the morning

I like the way you moan girl don't you know you got that humm girl

[Verse 2]
I'm on the phone talking to Mrs. Who
I don't want to pump till the bottom white bloom
Tip type game all the things you do
Let her tease me, outta tease you
Baby want to come at 3 AM
She giving me the keys to the new be	-M
Plus she giving me and you won't see him
And she giving me to the you see them
Pick up the phone then arrive at the door
She came out and the white touched the floor
Gotta lay back cause the rain goin pour
Hope for the shade make it one night more
Looking like a diva with the queens on tour
I belong she's allmo
In the bedroom now its time for sex
Anything goes you can walk like mex
After making love and I will not jet
Up and down and around we go
I can feel her nails when she scream below
I'm a real pimp see I still gotta go
Some get pussy and they still don't know

[Verse 3]
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (be gone)
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah now throw yo half
Put back on the things you ask
You the man when it's double dare I'm L I'm L

You can see it in my eyes when I'm hustlin, burnt up tryin to come up from
Nothing
I be stackin them stacks bringin em back in the back of the lac
Talkin in codes to the burn outs hustlin daily got me turned out
You know my motto to invest and chase that paper like lotto
Follow, tryin to bring back money in car loads
But its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
When you just want to hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit

This is my motto, pop the first bottle

Ride up to my home paid for mansion celebrating you ladys on tables dance on

Now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
No how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
Don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
No matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
Make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it
The Rockafellers Stellers and Jones
To many other people got paper but we homeless
And let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban

And I'm steady staggerin'
Look at the Remy that I had last week off Madison
Tryna walk a straight line
But I can't find a pattern in her
I looked at the door
Put my drink on the floor
Cocked my nine when I opened it slow
Half-breed Chinese, sittin' a Lac
And about a hash green, plus
The audacity of the star
Strippin' and maneuver her ass like next to me
Actually, this S-E-X is testin' me
A-double-P, E-A-L
And it sound like her body is callin' me
But it might be the alcohol in me
And the sex appeal, it keep on drawin' me

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Sex, sex, appeal, whoa-ah

I'm finna get her off, high Hydro
Bump a crown from mista porch
Hey there lil' mama
Do you wanna come kick your heels
In the back of my Range Rove?
Wanna do what'chu did before?
Don't trip, cause ""You Already Know""
C-O-M-E-B-E-W-I-X-T, that me, Belo
Just do it ""Nice And Slow""
You gotta raise the door
And I don't pay for show
'Cause I don't pay fo-sho
You can grab yo' kicks and go
Put on yo (shh), let's roll
Recognize the G, true ballin'
Do or die, pimp or die, not fallin'
When we all in, yo club
Chillin' with the chiefs and the dubs
And I got love for the jiggaboos
Pop Chrys' with the niggas, and the bitches too
Dig a bitch out the Grove, like I just do
People say I'm like a statue
Spit the B in yo ear
Take you off to the real, and I match you
Sex appeal

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Whoa-ah, na, na, na

Go kick it wit' my niggas in the drop Regal
Do what, a Twista, Caddy, Po-Pimp sequel
On my way to the club, peek-a-boo motherfucka
But first I gotta roll one, for my people
Hate us for doin' that, saw us
Through Windy City, nightcrawlers
Who would have imagined lyricals on the legacy?
Cities legendary like, Rap-A-Lot and Legit Ballaz
Shit, let the Mo' pop, and drop the top
Ride like it's summertime in the Chi
Get'chu blind, to the abra
Blowin' lime to the sky
Rhyme til' I die, tryin' to get by
Lil' miss, lookin' tight in the coochie
Whether it's a Gucci
Love the way you do the jiggy when you walk
Soundin' like you freaky, girl, every time you talk
I know ya aura make the fellas wanna break 'em off
Hear me brotha?
Gotta try to get our feet further
Hit a lic' and feed, one-another
'Cause all we got is, each-other
I take it week after week
And to kick the flows that I freak but, uh
Roll up on a chick and spit game
Let me show you how the back seat of a Lexus feel
Take a hit of cess and chill
Girl, dressed to kill
Whippin' that sex appeal
Next appeal?

Sex, sex, appeal (whoa)
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal, hey
Sex, sex, appeal
Said her body keep
Sex, sex, appeal (callin', callin', callin' me)
Sex, sex, appeal (callin', callin', callin' me)
Sex appeal, sex, sex appeal

Do or Die,"I sit alone in the basement
Facing, chasing these wicked, demons
Got thoughts up in ma head of my daddy's wasted s-semen
Havin' her in the bedroom,
9-1-1 'cause I'm not breathin'
Feelin like death is getting closer and I can't stop from secedein'
Do I run to the mirror
Look at me, and pull the trigger.
Hooker said body found dead and gone
Well shit, just another dead nigga.
My future, lookin weary, hear me
Maybe after that wanna flex, wanna hustle
Never lay down a bit and tussle
Take my life, in one night
Now I'm havin' visions
Do or die based on decisions
Movin crystal sista, mssions
But I wanna be and fly away like pigeons
I missin my family an all
But I just don't know dog
'cause I left another dog in the back yard
An he jab wit the left an he hit hard
(but I break off)

(Chorus)
And that's why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin' too cold
We yellin it off the ""O""
'cause the world's full of bitches
(picture this)
Cold cold world.
They ask why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin too cold
We yellin out the ""O""
'cause the world's full of bitches
It just is
Cold cold world

Picture two worlds collide
Every civilization died
Catchin bullet holes
You can still hear they mamas crying
In every second is the grave laid tight
Niggas getting murdered and losin paper and they life
These days ain't so bright now
This is a message to how shorties gotta pipe down
I know we wansta weather crime on the streets
We hear the sound of the heat
And every round is takin ya six feet
I heard the cops killed you last week
You got shot tryin to take the phone off the seat
Rest in peace, I know it's better when your eyes sleep
God take us by the hands as we right deep
No longer seek for the things that weaken the flesh
Did we believe and have faith when it bothered us?
I understand that we all must return to dust
And leave behind everything that our hands have touched
God, this world is too much.

(chorus)

I first took a breather
Heard a voice to the 1-9
Nigga tryin tear ma life line
Get it back and to ma right man
Seeing blood on the sleece and a black nine
Please god is it my time?
Hold on to what am I face up for
Black the night was
No light was
Willing with the wind blew in
Below, with a slug to the moon
Open in time with the tomb
Looking for the hospital room
Feelin kinda dizzy from the blood shed
Turn around and heard a thug said
I gotta place we can play at
Hop to da 99' never get at all red
Come out quick before we all dead
To the back row
Sippin henesey
Better get relocated to the ash row
Here that nine with the bullet-proof vest go
Hottie lets go
Pull a chromium free with the vest go
Just a little on the testicle
Never leaving till the rest go
And it's best to know
Every dog on a day got a chance to bring
Got a chain for the best clothes
I wanna die my best slow
And even in my death glow
Lets have a prayer for the world, the cold one
From the old to the small one
Just to say that we are one
Father listen
This world is cold.

Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, 'cause she know she a star
Did you want to ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you want to blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes why'all
Rather be, let it test why'all
Light the be	 if it's special
Can I undress to relax why'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the five double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?

An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a fiftyball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin through stunting why are you running
Cause I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming through balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb??????
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cause' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do you?

that leading us, is it me or you who tried to resist
got you convinced lost in the mist
grabbing the sheets and balling her fists

The money, power, money and power
How can this world rotate without this money and power?
If I had money, I'd keep my peoples outta poverty
'Cause ain't no more starvin' when y'all around me (Shiiit)
This what it gotta be B, and every playa got paper
Shinin' like a superstar, with matchin' minks and gators
Keepin' our family off this poor table
Cause ain't no food on it
And every crab up in this bucket gotta move on it
I'm just a ghetto boy

Livin' in this ghetto world
Stayin' with' this ghetto chick
Hopin' to have a ghetto girl
And after all, ain't no spaces for that
How can we live up in this world, when ain't no place for the blacks?
Cause every dollar got a dream behind it, we seem to be blinded
Malcom X, he had to dream to remind us
Believe me, havin' money can have this world fucked up
But it can't answer yo' prayers, when you get down on yo' luck

Takin' baths with' broken showers

Callin' cops, cause we known to plot
Break in they home, on some bogus capers
But I never thought that it would affect me later
Until I seen the hustle, when niggas ridin' stretch Navigators
But, more now then later, I should come up
Cause I seen my homie on the block, slangin' rocks
And then his spot get gunned up
I never visioned it'd be homicide
Because they told me he'll live
That's what they said when my homie Boosie died
Could all these millions bring my nigga back?
Could all these millions feed children?
Could all these millions make my spirit fat?
Would all my friends become my enemies?
When my family becomes astonished
Will my strengths becomes an enemy?
Is this ""pretend to be? 
A vivid and magically?
A vivid and magically
I wonder, I wonder

I wonder, whoooooaa-ooohhh-oaahhhhh

I wonder what my life would be if I

I'm not poor anymore
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again

Back in the days, when I was poor
I'm not poor anymore (Da-da-da-da)
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again (Ohhh)

I remember when I stole deep
When it was cold outside
Sellin' packs and holdin' heat
Run up and I fold in the street

And the city get as cold as, thugs
I wonder will I come up? Get gunned up?
Turned up? Or anotha' sta-tistic
And my mama just goin', ball-istic
Realistic-ally, don't wanna do the caper
But I gotta get the paper, niggas ballin'
'Cause the county judge is callin'
And the lawyer keep stallin'
Why my niggas keep fallin', victim
To the same old theory?
Another bad outcome, leavin' mothers just out-done
Then it suddenly just sinked in
That my nigga just died last weekend, tears rollin'
And I'm goin' off the deep end
But I gotta stay stong, for the mothers and the kids
Just standin' there lookin' at the chalk line
In his hand was a cocked nine
Now should I walk a straight line?
'Cause ""Time After Time""
I just wanna rewind, and talk to you
At the grave site, gave it to 'em every day and night
But it's alright, and I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you (Just really wanna talk to you)

Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with three, one, two, seven, six, two, ten
Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the bead, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes want to snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe, to the crib

Seven deuce five, the ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour, like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself, a to the motherfucking K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and em
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls
'Cause they thinking about sampling em
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We're learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Mm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the see-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-see, A-see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
'Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexing one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smoking on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when out of me gotta be
Right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk come on suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, want to see what that'd be like
I know you want to try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean coasting have a cigarette thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be giving women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game
But it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a player do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit
That be	Low and AK'll do, wearing gray and blue
If a hoe want to holler then you a player if you hit them ends
and get the dividends but you a pimp if you can get
The same hoe to want to freak your friends

Dobie Gray,"Every night
I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love,
(You get the best of my love.)
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.
(You get the best of my love.)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream.
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Doc Cheatham,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Was it just by chance we spoke of love

Ma mère est née là bas, mon père est né là bas. Moi je suis né ici dans la misère et les cris. (bis)

C'est le deuxième couplet, j'espère qu'on va clipper. Tu pourras voir la tristesse de mon quartier. Ici tout est gris, ça s'appelle Paris. Les rues sont mortes, les filles décolorées. Pour rester bronzées, elles brûlent sous U.V. Toujours fâchée la fille de la ville est agressive comme un flic en civil. Y a comme une odeur de gaz sur les Champs-Elysées, et les bombes pètent dans le RER D. Ma mère est fatiguée, je la laisse se respirer. Je vis de mon côté et tente de subsister. Arrête de rapper me crie-t-elle toute la journée. Ce n'est pas sérieux, trouve un métier. Fumer ça donne faim, je suis Arsène Lupin. Je tape à E.D ; même sans les mains. Sur mon canapé, on est moins serré. C'est sûr certains se sont fait soulever. Je pense aux novices et n'oublie pas mes complices.

REFRAIN

J'veux porter des shorts toute ma vie. Avec mon escorte quitter Paris. Manger du poisson grillé sur la plage du Gosier. Prendre des bains de mer avec le Ministère. Mais je me suis noyé, je ne sais pas nager, les rues sont profondes et mènent toutes au Boulevard Ney. Comment s'en sortir pour la fille du quartier ? Elle croit que pour percer, il faut se faire trouer. Certains jouent au foot et veulent devenir pro. D'autres dealent et rêvent de kilos. Les seringues mortes se ramassent à la pelle sur les trottoirs de la rue La Chapelle. On protège nos fils de tout ce vice. Dans les cours d'école, on ne sniffe plus de colle. Drogue et alcool ont pris le monopole. Ma vie n'est pas simple, elle n'est pas funky. Moi je suis né ici et mon enfant aussi.

J'enfile mes gants tachetés et ma blouse craquée. Ma secrétaire flaire. Le carnet de rendez-vous m'a rendu fou. Trop de patientes, trop de paires de fesses. Ça me hante, trop d'herpès. Dis-moi, dis-moi, son infection sera-t-elle belle, belle, belle. Le docteur a peur, c'est con mais bon. Vais-je assurer ? Comment va se passer la première consultation ?

Refrain :
La première, la première, la première, la première consultation. (bis)

De peur de se faire fouetter puis au bled réexpédier, certaines veulent me forcer à falsifier mes certificats de virginité. Elles savent que tout peut se négocier. Des malades imaginaires de 70 ans, me font perdre mon temps. Des fois je me crois dans la brousse au Viet-Nam. Alors comme les cainris j'opère au napalm. Sur ces dames glissent ma langue et ma lame. Des maris jaloux accompagnent leurs femmes. Je suis donc obligé de travailler avec doigté et subtilité. Mais comme les sadiques, j'adore être regardé. Je travaille où d'autres s'amusent.

(Refrain)

Je prescris du Mycologue et des Dufaston. Une patiente me fait remarquer que mon spéculum est rouillé. Frottis, frottas, j'ai fini le taf. Des patientes que j'ai loupées, je me méfie, je fais gaffe. Je rentre chez moi. Ma femme m'a fait des moules frites. Pourquoi ? Comme lui a dit monsieur Marie, elle a mis des habits sexy. Le devoir conjugal ça suffit. J'ai fini de travailler et dois recommencer. Je travaille où d'autres s'amusent. Peut-être que j'abuse mais en tout cas, j'accuse toutes celles qui dans mon cabinet s'amusent. C'était la première, la première consultation.",Première Consultation
Doc Gyneco,"It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember, 
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

I took a flight to France
To make'em jump up, to make'em wiggle and dance
Now who in command, I got to promise I got to promise I got to promise
That I'm coming back, free world where it's all about peace
Who got my back wave your hands to that, that white and black creed whatever
That you do sing the rap with that cruz Dogg pound DPG Daz just call me Dillinger
Glad that you made it, the whole world was expecting it, jump up clap your hands,
Stamp your feet and get real with it he way that we party your know
We staying real with it my man Doc scooped me up and put me on a block
Stopped the watch and said to party don't stop

J'ai commencé par écrire et j'ai chanté
Jamais jamais j'aurai cru rapporté du blé
J'me suis fait arnaquer mais vous savez
Que le plus important c'est que le message est passé.
Première Consultation liaison Quality Street
De l'amour à donner, du papier à brûler
Chacun son truc, je connais mon rayon
J'ai juste besoin d'une feuille et d'un crayon,
C'qu'il y a de plus à dur à faire, mener une vie honnête
Être un rebelle mais toujours droit dans sa tête
Le rap hardcore ça m'impressionne pas
Je kiffe sur le travailleur qui élève sa millefa
Sur le scarla, qui achète une maison à sa mama
Tu sais ce que j'attends tu sais ce que je ressens mais j'me sens seul tellement
Seul personne à rappeler, solitaire je pourrais pleurer

Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,

Doc Holiday,"Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold
The night draws the warmth from my flesh
Howls in the distance
The wolves they catch my scent
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh

But I 

Cannot run, I cannot hide
I'm moments old, yet terrified
Snarling breath is on my face
I am damned in this place

Morning breaks the evening darkness
Daylight sings so loud
Father holds my in his arms
And laughs for he is proud
'All is well' my mother cries
A kiss for me her child
But at night my heart turns black
And calls me to the wild

In the night where the wolf-bane grows
In the night when the full moon glows

Cry wolf 

Alone in your room
By the light of the moon
Your glory is shining so bright
You prey for the day
Oh show me the way
The devil takes over tonight
It's too late, night is here
The time that you dread
The time when you loose all control

Your bodies in pain
You cry in vein
Satan takes over your soul

Cry wolf 

Even a man who's pure of heart
He says his prayers by night
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows
And the moon's full and bright

I cannot resist their call
It strengthens as I age
To the pack to join the feast
And fear immortal rage
Never can I live the life
Of every normal child
Forever I must answer
To the call of the wild

The call of the wild",Cry of the Wolf

Doc Hopper,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me.

I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.

Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.

Doc Severinsen,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

Was so inviting

Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello

Doc Severinsen,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Am I too late to make amends?

The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
