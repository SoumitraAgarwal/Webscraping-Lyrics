Linda Purl,"Hold me, hold me
Never let me go
Until you've told me, told me
What I want to know
And just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
(Hold me tight, never let me go)
Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do
I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say adieu, so kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you","Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"
Linda Purl,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Linda Purl,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Linda Purl,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill
Linda Purl,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

A-wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground

A-wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come
Linda Purl,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Linda Purl,"Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your feet, she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say ""When""

Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

[Instrumental]

",Too Close for Comfort
Linda Purl,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Linda Ransom,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Linda Ronstadt,"Look out your window, the rain is turning into snow
So the time has come you know, you must decide to stay or go
Oh how you love me! Sweet summer blue and gold. Will you stay with me? Long winter's grey and cold

Go love, open up the door you'll see the winds aren't warm anymore
The birds we heard all summer long were chased away by winter's storms
Oh how you love me! Sweet summer blue and gold. Will you stay with me? Long winter's grey and cold

Tell me with just a word if you're going to stay love, we'll wait the winter out, when summer comes we'll play, love
Oh how you love me! Sweet summer blue and gold. Will you stay with me? Long winters grey and cold",Sweet Summer Blue and Gold

It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down
Don't get upset, I am not pleading
Or saying I can't forget you
Well it don't even matter who you awaken with tomorrow
Cause baby you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
Oh you know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'll just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind

It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

Baby you've been on my mind

Baby you've been on my mind



","Baby, You've Been on My Mind"
Linda Ronstadt,"Sit by my window watch the rain
I hear it beatin' on my window pane
All the troubles I had
Bet no one ever hurt this bad

My baby left me all alone
Wait for a letter sit by the phone
It makes me so sad
Cause no one ever hurt this bad

Since you went away
I can't face the day
Night brings nothing but pain
I thought I could go on
I see that I was wrong
Baby please come home
I just can't to be alone

Somebody somewhere hear my plea
Send my baby home to me
It would make me so glad
Cause no one ever hurt this bad

Since you went away
I can't face the day
Night brings nothing but pain
I thought I could go on
I see that I was wrong
Baby please come home
Well I can't stand to be alone

Somebody somewhere hear my plea
Send my baby home to me
It would make me so glad
Cause no one ever hurt this bad

Sit by my window watch the rain
I hear it beatin' on my window pane
Sit by my window watch the rain
I hear it beatin' on my window pane",Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad
Linda Ronstadt,"Baby oh baby
Tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Well let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flying
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind

Break my mind
Break my mind
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break my mind
Break my mind oh lord
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind

Baby oh baby
Well let me take your suitcase off of that scale in time
Just tell the man that you suddenly developed a thing about high flying
Cause if you say goodbye to me you know you're gonna break my mind

Break my mind
Break my mind
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break my mind
Break my mind oh lord
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind

Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine

Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind",Break My Mind
Linda Ronstadt,"This old world may never change
Not the way it's been
And all the ways of war
Can't change it back again
 
I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me
 
I'm not the one to tell this world
How to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all hate is gone
 
I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me
 
Sometimes I think about
Saturday's child
And all about the times
When we were running wild
 
I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me
 
This old world may never change
This old world may never change",Dolphins
Linda Ronstadt,"It only seems like yesterday
You got a restless look
Said goodbye in the same old way
Like I knew you would

You remember, do you remember
Everything we said
Promise made with a kiss for sure
Like a book I read

It's about time you came back anyway
It's been a long long time
Been alone most every day
You've been on my mind

I always wondered where you went
To find some peace of mind
You never seemed to give much thought
To leaving me behind

You remember, do you remember
Everything we said
Promise made with a kiss for sure
Like a book I read

It's about time you came back anyway
It's been a long long time
Been alone most every day
You've been on my mind

It's about time you came back anyway
It's been a long long time
Been alone most every day
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
",It's About Time
Linda Ronstadt,"It's a cinch that I've been wrong
And it's clear it's not been long
Since I was hard on you
But now a time has come
When yesterday don't mean nothin'
Now I'm in love with you
And you've taken me the long way around

Take a look how young we are
A month has changed the moon and the stars
Changing the things we do
You've been lookin' for something strong
When other things don't mean nothin'
Now I'm in love with you
And you've taken me the long way around

Well I can't see beyond the doubt that's in your eye
It's on the outskirts of my fading alibi

It's a cinch that I've been wrong
And it's clear it's not been long
Since I was hard on you
But now a time has come
When yesterday don't mean nothin'
Now I'm in love with you
And you've taken me the long way around
Now I'm in love with you
And you've taken me the long way around",Long Way Around
Linda Ronstadt,"How many times have I read farewell lines
In the things that you never seemed to say?
How many times have I read those last lines
And wondered why it ended this way?

Words of goodbye and all those loving lines
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time

How you would write about the bright lights
And your words always clouded up my eyes
How you would write about the bright lights
It's a wonder that I never realized

Our race was run now and another's just begun
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time

When your letters stopped the tears that I fought
How they came in the flood of memories
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought
How they ran like the rivers to the seas

Each sunny day, you slip further away
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time
",Number and a Name
Linda Ronstadt,"Well everybody knows you been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
I'm gonna hit you on the head with a pan of cornbread
If you had any sense you'd quit

'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
I said you were the only man in this whole world
So now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

Well I'm a-workin' every day all you wanna do is play
I'm gettin' tired of staying home all night
Well I'm a-coming unglued from your funny little moods
Now honey baby that ain't right

'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
I said you were the only man in this whole world
So now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

Well I'm a-packin' up my clothes
Nearly everybody knows that you're still just a-puttin' me on
And when I start a-walkin' gonna hear you start a-squawkin'
And a-beggin' me to come back home

'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
I said you were the only man in this whole world
So now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

Linda Ronstadt,"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money

Cannot mend this heart of mine
",Silver Threads and Golden Needles
Linda Ronstadt,"Well you can read it in the morning papers
Hear it on the radio
Crime is sweeping the nation
This world is about to go

We need a good old case of salvation
To put the love of God in our souls
We need a whole lot more of Jesus
And a lot less rock and roll

We need more old time camp meetings
And a lot more prayers of faith
Prayers that will move a mountain
Save our souls from the burning waste

We need a good old case of salvation
To put the love of God in our souls
We need a whole lot more of Jesus
And a lot less rock and roll

We need more old fashioned preachers
Pouring out their hearts in prayer
When you're in their presence
Well you know that the Lord is there

We need a nationwide revival
To put the love of God in our souls
We need a whole lot more of Jesus
And a lot less rock and roll

We need a whole lot more of Jesus
And a lot less rock and roll

",We Need a Lot More of Jesus (And a Lot Less Rock & Roll)
Linda Ronstadt,"I'm gonna plant me some seed
Grow me an ocean
Cut me some trees
And build me an island
Stand on the corner
Flag down a streetcar
Go somewhere and phone him
And ask him where my thoughts are
I'm gonna say to him
Are my thoughts with you babe
How twisted, babe, are they
Since you went away, babe
I ain't been thinking too straight
And if that don't get through
I'm gonna build me a flower
Sit down in the morning dew
And kiss it every hour
I'm gonna turn out the lights
Turn on the night
Give up the fight
Go for a flight
Catch me a kite
Who cares what's right or wrong
When I get to the moon
Rent me a room
Sit in the gloom 
All alone
And cry are my thoughts with you babe
How twisted, babe, are they
You know, since you went away, babe
I ain't been thinking too straight
I'm gonna turn out the lights
Turn on the night
Give up the fight
Go for a flight
Catch me a kite
Who cares what's right or wrong
When I get to the moon
Rent me a room
Sit in the gloom 
All alone
And cry are my thoughts with you babe",Are My Thoughts with You?
Linda Ronstadt,"It was not so long ago, maybe just a year or so
When I was lonely and when looking for someone
Way down south in New Orleans just a-lookin' for a dream
And that's when I found him that's where it all begun

He was there on that night said for you I know I'm right
I'll be with you until my race is run
He walked into my life with his cold evil eyes
And with the length of his mind, he dark the sun

Well, my memory cannot speak and, oh Lord, I'm feeling weak
But I blame it on the fact that I was young
Though I know it may sound strange, there is no way I can change
What my fate has laid out for me now is done

He was there on that night, said for you I know I'm right
I'll be with you until my race is run
He walked into my life with his cold evil eyes
And with the length of his mind he dark the sun

And with the length of his mind he dark the sun

Now do you want my love
Or are we through

That's why I'm leaving it up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through

Here's my heart in my hand
And I, I don't understand
What did I, what have I done wrong
You know I worship the ground you walk on

Now do you want my love

Linda Ronstadt,"Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make this run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hands upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Saviour there to guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
And the angels there to join us
In God's grace forevermore

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You will reach the Union Depot
Into which your train will ride

There you'll meet the superintendent
God the father, God the son
With a happy joyous greeting
Weary pilgrim, welcome home

Blessed Saviour there to guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
And the angels there to join us
In God's grace forevermore

In God's grace forevermore

Linda Ronstadt,"Well they all said Louise was not half bad
It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act a little girl
A deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade
Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried
Ah but women like Louise well they get by

Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd always put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Louise rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard her say
Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go this way

Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight
Well goodnight Louise goodnight

But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""

Linda Ronstadt,"Well I hope that the friend that you've thrown yourself on
Gets drunk and loses her job
And every road that you travel on
Is dusty rocky and hard

I couldn't make you love me
You only made me blue
So all in all if the curtain should fall
Then I hope that it falls on you

And I will have sweet
Sweet sweet mental revenge
I will have sweet
Sweet sweet mental revenge

Well I hope that the train from Caribou, Maine
Runs over your new love affair
You'll walk the floor from dawn to dawn
And you'll tear out your peroxide hair

I never was your woman
Cause you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall
Then I hope that it falls on you

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow?
Linda Ronstadt,"Round my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if he's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
But I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there",I Still Miss Someone
Linda Ronstadt,"Hey Colorado
It was not so long ago
I left your mountains to try life on the road
But I'm tired of that race
It was much too fast a pace
And I think I've found my place
Colorado, I want to come home

I had a man there but I left him far behind
I could have loved him if I'd only had the time
Ah but I stopped along my way
Just long enough to say
That I'd really like to stay
But my baby
You know I have to go

I was too young
To know what I'd done
I made my plans
But I was wrong
Yes I was wrong

Is it too late to change my mind
I've done some thinking 
And I'm trying hard to find

Linda Ronstadt,"If you've ever been taken for money
If you've ever gone down with your pride
If you've ever stood up for a good friend and lost

With a picture in both of his hands
It's like part of your life is already begun
With something that you don't understand

But don't cry now
Oh don't cry now
Don't cry now
No don't cry now

When you're lying alone in the night time
And your loneliness turns into fear
With the words of your memory failing and falling
You're drowning in a river of tears

But don't cry now
Oh don't cry now

If you've ever thought much about freedom
You might find yourself caught in some door
With somebody you love more than (Incomprehensible to my ears)
And you've been weeping but you don't know what for

But don't cry now
Oh don't cry now
Don't cry now
Oh don't cry now
Don't cry now
Woah don't cry now",Don't Cry Now
Linda Ronstadt,"Once I had fame
Oh I was full of pride
Had lots of friends
Always here right by my side
Well my fame oh it died
Now my friends all try to hide

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and smile
I never thought
They'd be gone after a while
Well my friends let me down
And the smiles turned to frowns

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Once I had love
Ah but I couldn't be true
To get back that love
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
Well I've loved
And I've lost
And now I'll pay the cost

Everybody loves a winner

Linda Ronstadt,"You don't know how I feel
You don't seem to care
If I let you see it through my eyes
You wouldn't see anyone there

It's no wonder I been crying
It's no wonder that I'm blue
My crazy heart was gone and let somebody know
When it's time for me to go
Tired of being lonely
Tired of what you do to me
Hear it raining in my heart
Well I've been lonely before
But I've been so long without sunlight
I can't take another day more

No wonder I been crying
It's no wonder I been blue
My crazy heart can't tell me why
I can't tell you goodbye
Oh no, I'm tired of all this tragedy
I'm giving you back your misery

You better put on a fast one
I think I'm gonna pull through
You better play another fast one
No matter what you do
Put your money in a fast one
I don't want to hear the blues
Put on another fast one
Trying to forget about you

Well it ain't no wonder I been crying

Tired of what you put me through

Now you better put on a fast one

Linda Ronstadt,"Now that you find yourself losing your mind
Are you here again
Finding that what you once thought was real
Is gone and changing

Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day
How can I place you above me
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you

Coming to you at night I see my questions
I feel wiped out
Wishing that maybe in a year or two
We can laugh and let it all out

Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day
How can I place you above me
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you

O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you",I Believe in You
Linda Ronstadt,"written by J.D. Souther
It hurts to say goodbye
And when the words are going by
The wind can blow them right back in your eye
You can almost see it

Time will let you know
And when you turn around to go
The aching in your heart begins to show
You can almost see it

You can almost see it
You can almost see it
You can almost see it going by

So you take another train
But the tracks all look the same
They run around in circles like a game
You can almost see it

I can almost see it
I can almost see it
I can almost see it going by",I Can Almost See It
Linda Ronstadt,"I've had bad dreams too many times, 
To think that they don't mean much any more. 
Fine times have gone and left my sad home, 
Friends who once cared just walk out my door. 

Love has no pride when I call out your name. 
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame. 
I'd give anything to see you again. 

I've been alone too many nights 
To think that you could come back again. 
But I've heard you talk: ""She's crazy to stay."" 
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say. 

Love has no pride when I call out your name. 
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame. 
I'd give anything to see you again. 

If I could buy your love, I'd truly try my friend. 
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end. 
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees; 
Asking for you to come back 
I'd be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me. 

Love has no pride when I call out your name. 
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame. 
I'd give anything to see you again. 

Yes, I'd give anything to see you again.",Love Has No Pride
Linda Ronstadt,"In America you get food to eat
Don't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet
You just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American

Ain't no lions or tigers
Ain't no mamba snake
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake
Everybody is as happy as a man can be
So climb aboard little wog and sail away with me

Linda Ronstadt,"Now Matthew was a country boy until one day he found
That cheatin' folks was easier than plowin' his daddy's ground
He left his home back in Ohio, bound for Chicago's town
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back

A bullet cut him down
And as he lay there dying
He said ""Will I see my Ohio?""
In my reply I lied a bit 

And said I did not know
Now Jim McCall he was meek and small
And to become a man
He'd have to build himself up tall 

With fancy folks and land
He threw some stones at honest friends
And he got himself these things
His children left him and he sneered 


""That's what my kindness brings""
And on the south side he got lost
He asked me where to go
In my reply I lied a bit 

And said I did not know

And my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the Good Book Jesus

I never wanted to go
Down the Stoney End

Linda Ronstadt,"At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

I know that time is gonna take its toll
We're gonna pay for the love that we stole
Ah it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah but our love keeps coming on strong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We'll steal away to the dark end of the street

And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by

Linda Ronstadt,"Well I spent my whole lifetime
In a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions
On the slightest of notions
And the first easy loving I found
But soon all the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away

There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face

Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away

Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away",Keep Me from Blowing Away

Blue as the deep blue sea

I think I'll spend some time alone
Yes, unless you've found a way of squeezing water from a stone

Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can
Let the springtime begin
Let the boy become a man
I done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song
I done been this lonesome picker a little too long

Linda Ronstadt,"Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My baby left me and he didn't say why
Well I guess I'll have to try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There have been times I find myself thinking of committing

Linda Ronstadt,"You think the love you never had might save you
But true love takes a little time
You can touch it with your fingers
And try to believe your eyes
Is it love or lies
So you're keeping your distance
A little bit of room around you
But if he doesn't return your call on time
Oh my my

You just act like a fool on a holiday
There's nothing that you wouldn't try
You must be a prisoner in disguise
Well this night life is my life
But there's no one else in it
And sometimes those lonesome breezes blow
But it's no show so you might as well go
If you think you could win it 
Without losing and letting it show

The city is no place to hide in
Everybody knows your number
And you know that you could never be alone if you tried
You just run like a man with no reason to run
And no place to ever arrive
You must be a prisoner
Look just like a prisoner
Well you must be a prisoner in disguise",Prisoner in Disguise

Said goodbye to no one
Thought it through
And left me standing in the road

But someday baby you'll be here
And I'll be going home without you
With blood on both my hands
'Cause I took you through
And now we're both too weak to stand
You think you're gonna live forever
And somehow find me there
But you'll be wearing golden wings
And fall right through the air

Well I'm a fool for trying
'Cause I get so blue
That I don't know when I'm crying
If you are ever lonely
And you let me know
I'll come running right on time

One day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done

She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style
It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile

She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and e'er will be

She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style

If your baby love's you right

Can't stop saying it

Keep on saying it saying it
I won't stop until you say it too
Love can be gentle soft and tame
Or so rough you wouldn't know its name
Shy and wild like a runaway child
Storms of love always end up mild

So when you give your heart
You get one too

Could you take me back and try me

Well you're not being kind

And you know you lied

And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine

You're someone else's love now, you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
That's why I'm lonely all the time

Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new

Oh, can't you tell by the way I run
Ev'ry time you make eyes at me. Wo oh.
You cry and you moan and say it will work out.
But honey child I've got my doubts.
You can't see the forest for the trees.

Oh, don't get me wrong. It's not that I'm knockin'.
It's just that I'm  not in the market
For a girl who wants to love only me.
Yes, and I ain't sayin' you ain't pretty.
All I'm sayin's I'm not ready for any person,
Place or thing to try and pull the reins in on me.
So Goodbye, I'll be leavin'.
I see no sense in the cryin' and grievin'.
We'll both live a lot longer if you live without me.

Linda Ronstadt,"Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love like a river flows",Faithless Love
Linda Ronstadt,"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And she looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and stood so close to you
Suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips have kissed you
And held you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I've missed you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you",I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You)

How can I be just your friend

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too

Well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Golly gee what have you done to me
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore

Do you remember baby last September
How you held me tight each and every night
Oh baby how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

There's no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days over you

Now you go your way baby and I'll go mine

I'll find somebody new and baby

Linda Ronstadt,"Love will abide, take things in stride
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time 

Wait for the day 
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause? 
Living in the memory of a love that never was 
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine 
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time","Long, Long Time"

Ramblin' round your city
Ramblin' round your town

As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

The peach trees they are loaded
The branches are bending down
Well I pick 'em all day for a dollar, Lord
As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

Sometimes the fruit gets rotten
Falls down on the ground
Well there's a hungry mouth for every peach
As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

My father hoped that I would be
Someone of high renown
But I am just a refugee

You left him for somebody other than you
To be the one to care

There's no time to find you now

And your towers are turning
I've gotta leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

Rock me on the water
Sister, won't you soothe my fevered brow
Ooh, rock me on the water
Gotta get down to the sea somehow

The road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman child and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can

Now everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
Well, the fires are raging hotter and hotter
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Sister, won't you soothe my fevered brow
Ooh, rock me on the water

It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you gliding in one place
Like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang onto that gospel cloud
When my life is over
Gonna stand for the father
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Linda Ronstadt,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

With their sails afloat
If I could only see

Maybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy

Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so

Why

Maybe I'm right

Linda Ronstadt,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

That kiss will live in my heart

Linda Ronstadt," don't want you to hold me tight
Till you're mine to hold
And I don't even want you to stay all night
Just until the moon turns cold

All I need is black roses
White rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues

You say that somebody really loves you
You'd find her if you just knew how
But honey, everyone in the whole wide world
Is probably asleep by now

And they're dreaming of
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues

Close your eyes
Sleep away all your blues
I've done everything but lie
Now I don't know what else I can do

Ah, the night time sighs and I hear myself
But the words just stick in my throat
Would you think that somebody like me
Might hurt much more than it shows

Just send me black roses
White rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
Black roses, white rhythm and blues

Linda Ronstadt,"You're in deeper than you seem
What you need, what you want
Are not the same thing

I don't want to see you
Till you know the cost of love
Please don't make me need you
Till you know the cost of love

You told me that we could make it right
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight
Do you think forevers only last all night

I don't want to see you
Till you know the cost of love
Please don't make me need you
Till you know the cost of love

First it's promises then it's lies
Watch those stares turn to turned-away eyes

You told me that we could make it right
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight
Do you think forevers only last all night

Don't come any closer
Don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer
Oh I just wanna hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk
But I can't say the words you want to hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear right here and now

Girls talk 
And they wanna know how girls talk 
And they say it's not allowed girls talk 
If they say that it's so don't they think that I know by now
That the word up on everyone's lips stick that you're dedicated
You may not be an old fashioned girl but you're gonna get dated
Was it really murder were you just pretending
Lately I have heard you are the living end

Linda Ronstadt,"They say I'm nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high
But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
They'd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look you over
Seen them leaving when the party's over

They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything but time

Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance

You'll never be the guilty party will you
Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
Maybe I'll never get over this change in style
But I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine
Don't want to lose you or say good-bye
I'm the guilty party and I want my slice
But I know you've got me in a grip-like vise
They can't touch me now

Close enough to touch
But careful if you try

And lord it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pine
And then the darkness fell

It's hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face, yes I did

Through the miles and miles of night
Deep in the heart of the Bible Belt

Where the citizens dance till dawn
Dance so close it's a sin almost

Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks alright again
Then the clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
For to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win


And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

No sometimes you just can't win.......

Linda Ronstadt,"I bid farewell to the state of old New York
My home away from home
In the state of New York I came of age
When first I started roaming
And the trees grow high in New York State
And they shine like gold in the autumn
Never had the blues from whence I came
But in New York State I got 'em

Talk to me of Mendocino
Closing my eyes I hear the sea
Must I wait
Must I follow
Won't you say come with me

And it's on to South Bend, Indiana
Flat out on the western plain
Rise up over the Rockies 
And down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again
And let the sun set on the ocean
I will watch it from the shore
Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

Since love is gone can't pull myself together

I must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself where is he

How I won you I will never, never know

Linda Ronstadt,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead

Linda Ronstadt,"Gone is the romance that was so divine
'Tis broken and cannot be mended
You must go your way and I must go mine
But now that our love dreams have ended

What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do

What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you

To tell my troubles to

When I'm alone with only dreams of you
That won't come true

How is the world treating you
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new
How did that romance come through
We haven't met since then
Gee but it's nice to see you again

What's new
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand
Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know

I haven't changed

Linda Ronstadt,"I thought I found the man of my dreams
Now it seems
This is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down
And say ""Can't we be friends?""

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long
I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down
And say ""Can't we be friends?""

Never again
Through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame?

I thought I found a man I could trust
What a bust
This is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down
And say ""Can't we be friends?""

Why should I care
Though he gave me the air?
And why should I cry?
Even sigh
Or wonder why?

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long

I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away

Linda Ronstadt,"I don't care if there's powder on my nose
I don't care if my hair-do is in place
I've lost the very meaning of repose
I never put a mudpack on my face

Oh who'd have thought that I walk in a daze now
I never go to shows at night but just to matinees now
I see the show, and home I go
Once I laughed when I heard you saying

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
Once you told me I was mistaken

That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You have what I lack myself

And now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again

To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind
Once you warned me that if you scorned me

Linda Ronstadt,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too


",Lush Life
Linda Ronstadt,"Sweetheart I love you
Think the world of you
But I'm afraid you don't care for me
You never show it

Don't let me know it
Everyone says I'm a fool to be
Pining the whole day through
Why do you act like you do

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me
Gee honey it seems to me
You love to see me crying

I don't know why I stay home
Each night when you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left alone
Singing the blues and sighing

You treat me coldly each day of the year
You always scold me whenever somebody is near dear
It must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't for can't you see

I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame

My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent
So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

Linda Ronstadt,"Have you anything to say to me
Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed

Oh skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

To a blossom-covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night
Wonderful music

Faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there

I shouldn't sleep

He can laugh but I love it

Each spring to him

All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

When I was very young
The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky
Above the ring I love so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and gold

All you can count on is the raindrops

Look at this life I still don't know where it's going.

Look at these eyes they never seen what matters.
Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered.

I don't know much but I know I love you.
That may be all I need to know.

So much I've never broken through.
And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly.
That only truth I'll never know is me and you.

Look at this man so blessed with inspiration.
Look at this soul still searching for salvation.

I don't know much but I know I love you.
That may be all I need to know.

I don't know much but I know I love you.
That may be all I need to know.

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all there is to know.",Don't Know Much
Linda Ronstadt,"Don't need a Rolex or a limousine 
Don't need my picture in a magazine 
Don't need approval of a chosen few 
Tell you what I do need, I need you 
 
Don't need no fixtures, fittings, or phone 
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own 
I Don't need reminding when the rent is due 
I tell you what I do need, I need you 
 
I need you like a fly needs a plane 
I need you like a ball needs a game 
I need you like a pool needs a cue 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you 
 
I Don't need no covered kisses for company 
I Don't want no washed up dishes soft soaping me 
I Don't need no other fella, honey I refuse

Oh, I need you like a ball needs a game

Linda Ronstadt,"Shattered
Like a windowpane
Broken by a storm
Each tiny piece of me lies alone
 
And scattered
Far beyond repair
All my shiny dreams
Just lying there
 
I'm broken but I'm laughing
It's the sound of falling glass
I hope that you won't mind if I should cry in public
While I wait for this to pass

Into fragments cold and gray
Sweep the pieces all away
Then no one will ever know how much it mattered

Linda Ronstadt,"I was walking down the street
With a lot of not much to do
Wondering only if it was gonna rain
When this guy came into view
For a moment I looked crazy
And at first I couldn't work out why
Then something made me turn back the hands of time
To a careless past goodbye

I dialed the number of all the reasons
Why you should button up and come on home

Are you on your own?
Are you having fun?
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?
 
Does a day go by like a memory?
Do you ever try to remember me
In an automobile or a crowded bar?
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are
 
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio
I just want you to know you were always my only choice
And where ever you go then I still love you so,
if you're still within the sound of my voice.
 
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?
 
And if you are still within the sound of my voice
watching this video, I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near
There's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice.
 
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress 
but only you can send a lifeline out to me.
 
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong 
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will
Are you still within the sound of my voice

And I feel so happy

That I kissed your little mouth
But when I awoke
I realized it was just the pillow
That I had so madly kissed

En estas horas de tristeza infinita
Cuando tu ausencia pesa mÃ¡s en mi vida
CuÃ¡ntos recuerdos
Llenan mi alma dormida

Aquellos besos ue quemaban mis labios
Aquellos cosas que temblando decÃ­as
DÃ³nde han quedado
DÃ­melo vida mÃ­a

Ya estoy cansada de esparar
Why de llorar
Why ya no puedo soportar
Mi soledad

why sin embargo yo te sigo queriendo
Why por quererte ya estoy enloqueciendo
Why poco a poco
Me olvido de vivir

Ya estoy cansada de esparar

En Mi Soledad
(In My Solitude)

In these hours of endless sadness
When your absence weighs upon my life
How many memories
Fill my weary soul

Those kisses that once burned my lips
Those things you told me trembling
Where have they gone
Tell me, my love

I am tired of waiting
And crying
And I can no longer stand
My solitude

Still I keep loving you
And in loving you I am going crazy
And little by little
I am forgetting how to live

",En Mi Soledad
Linda Ronstadt,"Bésame tú a mi
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Que mi locura te dio

Quién si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerta mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodó a tu pies

Quiero que vivas sólo para mi
Y que tú vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea nomás de ti
Bésame con frenesí

Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es más que amor frenesí

Hay en el beso que te di
Alma piedad corazón
Dime que sabes tú sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo

Quiero que vivas sólo para mí
Y que tu vayas pro donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea nomás de ti
Bésame con frenesí

Hay en el beso que te di
Alma piedad corazón
Dime que sabes tú sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo

Quiero que vivas sólo para mí
Y que tu vayas pro donde yo voy

In somebody else's arms

Your eyes are echoing ""Perfidia""
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh 
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now
I find my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh

Que envuelto en la brisa parece decir
Sí te quiero mucho, mucho, mucho, mucho

There'll be no returning

Where all is forgotten
And nothing's forgiven

Than I'll ever swim

The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river

I think of him now
On the road I am taking
And wonder how long
His heart will be breaking
But he'll never hear when
The teardrops are falling
Or the sound of my voice
Or the name I am calling

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden

So weep for the sons
And the dear darling daughters
For the passing of time
And the parting of waters
For all who have passed through
This world long before me
To a far distant shore line
Where no one waits for me

He's waiting on someone else's call

Why are you still out there
Beating your heart against the wall
Waiting for Jericho to fall
You hard-headed fool
Didn't your mama teach you
Anything at all

You can't treat the wrong man right
Or change a devil to an angel overnight
He'll wreck all your best laid plans for spite
You can't treat the wrong man right
You can't treat the right man wrong
When you're out on the town
Acting mean and head-strong
He'll sit home and wait for you all night long
You can't treat the right man wrong

A woman was whispering in my ear
And though I was trying not to hear
The message came through
She was someone who knew you
I guess she told me everything
I wasn't listening anyway
I know she had a lot to say
But nothing was clear
I only remember her voice
Above the sound of the pinball
Saying to me

You can't treat the wrong man right
Or change a devil to an angel overnight
He'll steal all your love and and fly by night
You can't treat the wrong man right
You can't treat the right man wrong
You can run all the way from here to Hong Kong
And he'll be waiting when you come back in sight
You can't treat the right man wrong
You can't treat the wrong man right
",You Can't Treat the Wrong Man Right
Linda Ronstadt,"Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

You might finally get a glimpse of what is right and what is wrong 
But the women 'cross the river; well they knew that all along
 
Oh the women 'cross the river work with tools that are ancient and hand-made 
And they plow their fields in perfect rows and then they rest beneath the shade 
Now we have learned to build, out of concrete, out of steel
And our buildings stand a thousand years but then even they are bound to fall 
But the women 'cross the river never learned to build a wall
 
Oh the women 'cross the river are as gentle as the dew upon the ground 
How I love to hear them laughing in the rain when it makes that perfect sound 
Now a soldier with a gun and a battle to be won
Might kill you with a bullet and you never even know the reason why

With the distance and the fear
That I will not return
Or find a way to bring you here
My emptiness grows deeper
I feel my spirit fall
As night comes like a blanket
It brings no sleep at all
I only hope that time will find
A way to work things out
We will be together

But to sit next to you, lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, don't think I'd be here
Asking myself if I have what it takes

To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start
To turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears

These days we all play cool calm and collected
Why, our lips could turn blue shootin' the breeze
But under the frost thought he detected
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knees

He said girl you've a beauty like I've never witnessed
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
But I've felt the cold follow the first kiss
And there's not enough heat in the fire burning there

We said we'd walk together baby come what may
There come the twilight should we lose our way
If as we're walking hands should slip free
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

We swore we'd travel darling side by side
And we'd help each other stay in stride
Each lover's steps fall so differently
So I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Everyone dreams of love lasting and true
But you and I know what this world can do
Let's make our steps clear that the other may see
And I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
And there 'neath the oak's bough soon we'll be wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Darling I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me
Darling I'll wait for you



",If I Should Fall Behind
Linda Ronstadt,"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails and negativity won't pull you through
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they'll really make a mess out of you

Well, if you see Saint Annie please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move and my fingers they are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend the doctor won't even say what it is I got

Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and she leaves you howling at the moon

Well, up on housing project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim

And if you're looking to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first and she left looking just like a ghost

Well, I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand beside me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough
",Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues

What else did we leave undone

When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
Was it just the time slipping through our hands
Right through our hands

Maybe I was trying to tell you
I've never known a love so strong
Maybe in the shadows of the night
We just couldn't tell right from wrong

Maybe it's a real life story
Living with a sad regret
Maybe you were just a sweet dream baby
Something that I'll never forget

When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
Was it just the time slipping through our hands

You only had to say the words
I would have turned around and heard

And the memories are rolling dice

And the wild flowers are scattered o'er the plains
We did love and roam midst the bowers
When thy downy cheeks were in their bloom
Now I walk alone midst the flowers
As they mingle their perfume o'er thy tomb
Shall we never more behold thee
Never hear thy laughing voice again
When the springtime comes gentle Annie
And the wild flowers are scattered o'er the plains",Gentle Annie
Linda Ronstadt,"Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean

When harm is done no love can be won
I know it happens frequently
What I can't understand oh please God hold my hand
Why it had to happen to me

And it's only love and it's only love
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out

Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean",Heart Like a Wheel
Linda Ronstadt,"When all our tears have reached the sea, 
A part of you will live in me, 
Way down inside my heart

The days keep coming without fail, 
A new winds gonna find your sail, 
And that's where your journey starts, 
You'll find better love, 
Strong as it ever was, 
Deep as a river runs, 
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore, 
We're gonna keep on coming back for more, 
'Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you see, 
Only the valleys and the peaks, 
I can see you on the top, 
You'll find better love, 
Strong as it ever was, 
Deep as a river runs, 
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walking, 
When snow falls high outside your door, 
Late at night when you're not sleeping, 
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore, 
You'll find better love, 
Strong as it ever was, 
Deep as a river runs, 
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me.",Please Remember Me

Linda Ronstadt,"Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head

The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side,
'Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray

Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Through the years we all will be together

So hang a shining star upon the highest bough

You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I’ll be home for Christmas

Even more than I usually do
And though I know it's a long road back
I promise you

Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time 

Wait for the day 
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause? 
Living in the memory of a love that never was 
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind

Let me go away from this lonesome town,
Won't be long till my song here is through,
And I know I'm on my last go round.

Couldn't heal all this pain in my soul.

What is love but a prelude to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead as your goal.
Here I go
Now you know why I'm leaving.

What can I lose?

I walk along on air
Building a castle there
For me and my love to share

Don't know the time

Sun in the sky
While I moon around, feeling hazy

Don't break my reverie
Until I find that he
Is daydreaming just like me

Before it's too late my love

Why not retire to a farm

In everything that's light and gay

Watch you melt into the night

Something inside starts to burning

Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying

Tears all over my face
I can't explain it don't understand it
I hadn't ever felt like this before

Now that funny feeling has me amazed
I don't know what to do my head's in a haze

Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen caricias, 
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran.

Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me

Linda Tate,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

All you beautiful babies been had
Who’ll be able to love you for
What you, what you really are?

Beauty, what is your face?
What has it given the human race?
All that it has given me is a longing for
People and things I could never afford

Ah, beauty, now that the walls of Troy are tumbling down
And poor Oscar Wilde’s verdict is out
And the Hope diamond’s up for auction

And what about Michael Jackson?
And I’m smoking again
In the morning looking at

Beauty, look at me
You who did line the apple once offered Eve
I fear you line the world we see
Filled with goodness only hidden by

Beauty, you make me sad
You make me sad

Send a shiver down my spine

You tried to drown me
Never mind to swim
And tried to eat me
Put a shiver on my skin

With million things
And tried to heal me
Wash off my sins

Bend over on the banks

Lindisfarne,"As she played, magicians seeing all this on the floor,
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw.
Had myself a nightmare,
Didn't think there could be much more.
Then in walked Lord Borgaasha with the Lady Eleanor.

She tied my eyes with a ribbon,
Of a silken gossamer thread.
I gaze with troubled vision,
On an old four poster bed.
Where Eleanor had risen to kiss the neck below my head,
And made me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

She gazed with loving beauty,
Like a mother to a son.
Like living, dying, seeing, 
Being all rolled into one.
Then all at once I heard some music,
Playing in my bones.
The same old song I'd heard for years,
Reminding me of home. 

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

Then creeping on towards me,
Licking lips with tongues of fire.
A host of gold and demons,
Screaming lust and ways desired. 
And when it seemed for certain, 
That the screams could get no higher.
I heard a voice above the rest,
Screaming you're a liar.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor,
I'm alright here in your arms.",Lady Eleanor
Lindisfarne,"When winter's shadowy fingers
First pursue you down the street
And your boots no longer lie
About the cold around your feet

Do you spare a thought for summer
Whose passage is complete
Whose memories lie in ruins
And whose ruins lie in heat
When winter comes howling in

When the wind is singing strangely
Blowing music through your head
And your rain splattered windows
Make you decide to stay in bed

Do you spare a thought for the homeless tramp
Who wishes he was dead
Or do you pull your bedclothes higher
Dream of summertime instead?
When winter comes howling in

The creeping cold has fingers
That caress without permission
And mystic crystal snowdrops
Only aggravate the condition

Do you spare one thought for the gypsy
With no secure position
Who's turned and spurned by village and town
At the magistrate's decision
When winter comes howling in

When the turkey's in the oven
And the Christmas presents are bought
And Santa's in his module
He's an American astronaut

Do you spare one thought for Jesus
Who had nothing but his thoughts
Who got busted just for talking
And befriending the wrong sorts?
When winter comes howling in
When winter comes howling in

",Winter Song
Lindisfarne,"Your nose is in your pipe, but you don't care
Your tattered tweeds and walking cane
All feel real
The monocled face with the knowing eyes
See it all go by
But you don't care

You dance your pants and sing with the Jew
Who knows your face from a different place
You don't care
You just don't care

Bow down, in out, feeling fine
Drinking bottles of American wine
You don't care
You just don't care

Lift the cracked old cup up to your mouth
And toast the feet that walk the street
From north to south
Walking kitten on a leash
A smile, a bow, a quick how-now brown cow

You don't care if the vicar's hair is falling out
He's still got a beer pout
You don't care
You just don't care

With the sausage roll that's underdone

On the way that my life, it should be
But look at the country man it's looking so nice
Feeling so good to be free

And throw my hands up in the air to the beat like (What?)

I've gotta say respectfully
I would like it if you take the cameras off of me
Cause I just want a little room to breathe
Can you please respect my privacy

Why can't you just let me
Do the things I wanna do
I just wanna be me
I don't understand why
Would you wanna bring me down
If I'm only having fun

Lindsay Lohan,"Nobody told me that I'd be in happy places
Just trying to erase the traces
What came before me
A girl that I used to see somewhere very deep
She's falling asleep and I'm trying to wake her said her pray

Now is a never ending thing
One more minute turns into another
Before I've had time to to run from all the other ones
And its so hard to live a dream
When the everything that they want you to be
Is anything but me

So much confusion circling inside my head
What this one and that one said
Its all an illusion
'Cause I'm still the same person no matter how fast I run
I'm trying to hold on to where it is I come from

Now is a never ending thing

And its so hard to live a dream

I've got a dry kind of thirst when drenched
All sunny days all I can see is the shadow
And I'm not above being under
And I'm at the brink though I know that I'm empty
And I always hide when its my turn to seek
My only belief is not to have faith in believing
Before I begin I'm over.(Disconnected)

Broken off again
And I'm only not lonely when I'm lonely by myself
Now the pain again I always backtrack forward
Cause all I know I'm Disconnected

Keep holding my breath while I'm trying to breath
Swimming against all of the waves and the rapids
I only win when I'm losing. (Disconnected)

Wherever I go a part of me is staying here with you
So take me, shake me if you want you can chase me

So here's your last change for redemption
So take it while it lasts because it will end

I can't live without you
Can't breathe without you

That you'll say dreaming of a different ending
I want to hold on but it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had

I keep tell myself things can turn around with time
And if I wait it out you could always change your mind
Like a fairy tale where it works out in the end
Can I close my eyes have you lying here again
Then I come back down
They don't pay back and
Then I realize its just what might have been.

Cause being strong just makes it worse so
What should I do? I'm torn into two

Lindsay Lohan,"No, I like when people talk in the beginning of songs, 
I think that's kind of rad, 

I don't think you should use it 

Well, something kind of introspective, 
Something that means a little bit to me, 

Like a little more...

Personal? 

You say you gotta go, but what does that mean? 
Do you wanna be together or is it just me? 
Sometimes I think you're in, until I think you're out 
It's like I'm swimming in the deep end, pull me out 
Wanted to feel, want you to know, 
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven, I could call my own 

Could we try a little more personal? 
Can we throw away all the casual, 
Cause the more I know about you, and the more you know about me 
It's easier to be, a little more personal 

It's like we do a dance when no one wants to move, 
But if I take the first step, maybe we can find a groove, 
I'm really trying hard, to not just walk away 
I think that its about time someone said 
Want me to feel want me to know 
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven I can call my own 

Can we try a little more personal 
Can we throw away all the casual 
'Cause the more I know about you and the more you know about me 
It's easier to be a little more personal 

I wanna know what goes on in your mystery 
I think that I could have the key to unlock everything 

Can we try a little more personal 
'cause the more I know about you and the more you know about me 
It's easier to be a little more personal 

Can we try a little more personal 
Can we throw away all the casual

Lindsay Lohan,"I can tell you things nobody knows
I've been everywhere nobody goes
Nothing gets me off the way that you do
You drive me crazy when you step in the room

Something 'bout your lips something about your kiss
Something 'bout your eyes keeps you on my mind
Thought it was nothing
Turns out it is something
Your the one that keeps me up every night
Who loves you
Who loves you
I think I do
Yeah, yeah, I think I do

You've crawled under my skin and I feel you there
You're with me all the time you come everywhere
When I needed space I pushed you away
But then I want you back, you're hard to erase

Something 'bout your eyes keeps you on my mind

I dream of another you the one who would never, never

Lindsay Lohan,"I was born a fighter, I was born on a rainy day, 
I've had my share of pain, but you missed most of that 
So many other things you had to do, you looked after you, 
Do you remember what you did?, do you know just what you missed?, 
And do you care 'bout what I have to say? 

[Chorus:]
You took my innocence away, I never had the chance to, 
You broke me in with your mistakes, thanks for the breakthrough 
But you won't bring me down, I always come around, 
You took my innocence away, but the best of me stayed 

It could be your blood, running through all my veins, 
That ties me to your fate, if I could just close my eyes, 
I black out all the reasons why, we're still in this place 
What you want is what you've got, you should've tried to make it stop 
I guess you couldn't find a way to let me in

loneliness has filled my soul, 
And it creeps inside and takes control, 
And I don't know how to begin giving up on everything

You took my innocence away, I never had the chance to, 
You broke me in with your mistakes, thanks for the breakthrough

For too long just to see it now
That i can't erase any mistake

Looking back for one more glance
Never made a second chance
I cradle the pain; regret that remains

I play it over and over differently
But its over 'cause you said i am free

You say my name
And tell me i can walk away
From all my fears and yesterday
I can hear you calling
You say my name
And tell me there's a better place
Lead me to your sweet embrace
I can hear you calling

Drinking from a bitter well
Wishing for a fairy tale
I thought we agreed how it should be

So now i am an afterglow
Too afraid to let it go
I need to believe there's more than i see

I play it over and over differently
But its over 'cause you said i am free

You say my name
And tell me i can walk away

Such a strong appetite.
With love from here, love from there,
You only get one bite.

With love from here, love from there,
When everybody went stag,
With love from here, love from there,
Everybody was a drag.

Lindsey Buckingham,"Written by Red Hayes & Jack Rhodes. 
How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had his money, I could do things my way.""
But little they know, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was living in fortune and fame,
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

?Cause money can't buy back your youth when you're old,
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When life has ended, my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt.
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind.",A Satisfied Mind

And the days dwindle down
To a precious few . . .

Go

And linger
In places no one ever goes

And the band had all gone home
When the lights go out what's it

Lindsey Buckingham,"Fire still burning, but in a while she'll make it rain
These rooms are all falling down, they couldn't stand the strain
I had the same old dream, she was hiding outside my door
She used to come from time to time but not any more

Still in my mind
Still in my mind

Wouldn't make any difference
We crossed that line
From the fire we will rise again
In our own time

Seasons turning, but in a while she'll make it snow
But this time I think she's gone for good but I never really know
Nothing here remains, just a vision of her face
The implications of a crime, it always takes her place

Of where I put my fist

It only means that when I steal from you

Not a cloud up in the sky
And then it starts to rain
My defenses hit the ground
And they shatter all around
So open and exposed

I found strength in the struggle
Face to face with my trouble

And you're tryin' but you can't hold on anymore
Every tear falls down for a reason
Don't you stop believing in your self
When you're broken

Little, girl, don't be so blue
I know what you're goin' through
Don't let it beat you up
Hitting walls and getting scars only makes you who you are
Only makes you who you are

No matter how much your heart is aching
There is beauty in the breaking, yeah

When you're broken in a million little pieces
And you're tryin' but you can't hold on anymore
Every tear falls down for a reason
Don't you stop believing in your self
When you're broken

Better days are gonna find you once again
Every piece will find its place, when you're broken

You'll always end up in second place.
It seems to me that you're addicted to pain,

You're used to everything not going your way,
You're searching high and low for a better way to think,
But it always leads you back to the drug and the drink,
You say that it's your saviour but both you and I know,

That that's a bunch of fucking bull,
You bit the hand that feeds you,
Now you got no place to go,
And the piper wants his payment in full.

In their image was I born?
Technically, I'm enhanced they tell me
From their minds my existence torn
They don't know all the hate I'm feeling
They don't see how it breeds inside
I'm afraid of the walls around me
I'm afraid but I cannot hide

There's a reason that I met you
It's to show me how to die
Simplify my wrong connection
Disconnect me where I lie
There is conflict all around us
There is conflict in my soul
Put an end to what's beginning
To make me want to play my role

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Link Wray,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""
I saved my baby from an Endless Sleep.",Endless Sleep
Link Wray,"Since my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?
My baby left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word

Now I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye
You know, she left me, yes, she left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word

Play it blues, boy

Baby, one of these mornings, Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and baby, your daddy will won't call you
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said goodbye

Now I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that the one I love is gone
My baby left me, you know, she left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word
Yes, since my baby left me, hey, and never said a word

Linkin Park,"I break down, fear is sinking in
The cold comes, racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

With arms up, stretched into the sky
With eyes like, echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you've been through

I remembered each flash / as time began to blur
Like a startling sign / that fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason / to fill this hole / connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight / but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide / the ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in / between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss / in every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret / and each goodbye
Was a mistake to great to hide
And your voice was all I heard

Linkin Park,"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)

I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

I find I can't rely on myself (myself)

I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch

(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and its dark again

Until the sun rises up

Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind

To explain in due time

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)",Crawling [Album Version]

Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and big bang theology
I've been digging in the crates
Ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Preformed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented a mic so I could start blessing it
Chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist my cords like double helix's
To show u what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of these MC's who hate us
Try on, leave u with out a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice

Linkin Park,"Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Like a face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: x2]

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus]

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

Linkin Park,"Watch as the room rocks men only moon walk
Mixed media slang, banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an Emcee
With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years

But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an emcee you've got to study the skill

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40

And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced

Using the waves of sound the true master
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up, step up

After years of pain staking research
By the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the sound institute have invented
A reliable audio weapons system

Actual movement of musical sound
In space used to carefully attack and neutralize
The cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up, step up

And you do it like this",Step Up [1999 Demo]

Linkin Park,"What do I do to ignore them behind me
Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

I cant hold on

I can't slow down
(Watching everything spin)
I can't look past
(Its starting over again)

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

Linkin Park,"Come on!

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
Ugh!

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

Ugh!

(No)
I won't let you control my fate while I'm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No)
I won't just sit here and wait while you weighin' your options
Your makin' a fool of me
(No)
You didn't dare to try and say you don't care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
(No)
It ain't like me to beg on my knees
Or, please oh baby please
that's not how I'm doin' things
(No)
No I'm not upset, no I'm not angry
I know love is love and love sometimes, it doesn't pay me
(No)
I'm never without you, I'll always be with you
You'll never forget me, I'm keeping you with me
(No)
I won't let you take me to the end of my row
Or keep burning and torching my soul
(No)
No I'm not your puppet
And no, no, no, I won't let you go

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

Linkin Park,"Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
Then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix 

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping way

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below

And I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party

All for shake and made eye contact
Party control showing all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A pig skin I never nerved you
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure
By any means and means of leaving you teens
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all

Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Ment to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile

Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest
Then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen
A telepath of the another verse with no postage

*faint* Crawling in my skin

*faint* Consuming, Confusing...
Crawling in my skin
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...

Ah, Crawling in my skin, (Crawling in my skin)
These wounds, they will not heal... (Wound, they will not heal)
Fear is how I fall, (fear is how I fall)
Confusing... Confusing what is real...
Confusing what is real...

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing,
This lack of self-control, I fear, is neverending.
Controlling, I can't seem
to find myself again. My walls are closing in...
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.)
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!!

Crawling in my skin,
these wounds, they will not heal.
Fear is how I fall,
Confusing what is real.

Discomfort, endlessly, has pulled itself upon me,
distracting, reacting,
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection,
It's haunting, how I can't seem...
To find myself again, my walls are closing in.

I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!!

Linkin Park,"I want to be in another place,
I hate when you say you don't understand,
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.

I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night,
Shining with the light from the sun,
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,
Find another place to feed your greed,
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed,
While I find a place to rest.

I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,

Gimme energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep on the drom
Used to be a team, passed that baton
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on.
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on.

So sick of you stressin'
Sick of you fessin'
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some
Find another place to feed your face
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.

Linkin Park,"Why's does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
But I find myself in places with names but no faces
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The the face inside is right beneath your skin
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)
I feel the light betray me
The sun

Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they've played

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go

Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet

All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me

Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

Trying not to break

Linkin Park,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Numb/Encore [Remix]

Linkin Park,"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away

Digging deeper just to throw it away

Digging deeper just to throw it away

Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load

Cock it back and then watch it go

Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse

Can't contain him;
He knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
So, why try ignoring him?

Linkin Park,"Turn my mic up louder
I got to say something
Lightweights stepping aside,
When we come in
Feel it in your chest
The syllables get pumping
People on the street
They panic and start running
Words on loose leaf
Sheet complete coming
I jump on my mind
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind
I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways
We march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us
They want to see jumping
Fuck that, I want to
See some fist pumping
Risk something
Take back what's yours
Say something that you know
They might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated
Like I had before
Like it's stupid standing for
What I'm standing for
Like this war is really just
A different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich
And an abandon the poor
Like they understand you
In the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way
To the bank and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect

For a leader so nervous
In an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

In my living room watching
But I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense
I know what might happen
The world is cold
The bold men take action
Have to react
Or get blown into fractions
Ten years old is something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me""
Do you see?
The soldiers they're out today
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic
At times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

I've never been perfect
But neither have you

Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

Linkin Park,"Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 

See you survived the worst but my life is glorious 
Betta know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious 
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now you can call me Morpheus 
As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious 
You know that I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now 
Superceded everyone of my middle struggles and 
Failure never ever has been an option 
A paper long like we was on the trap and we bout ta take the hood shoppin' 
Get it! 

[Chorus] 
Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the project to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) *yeah 
On the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
On the road *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 

When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line 
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind 
And it finally came time to do it or let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride 
Sing it! 

[Chorus]

Look in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm building 
Things that I could leave for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get the hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To counting money like Dre and Jimmy or Russell Ross 
But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it 
Sing it 

[Chorus]",We Made It [Acapella][Edit]
Linkin Park,"I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said

You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say

No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down black out blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it are you listening?

No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down
Black out blood in your eye

Floating down, as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground
In fields of paper white
And floating up you pass us in the night
A future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks

Linkin Park,"Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah, you are gonna get yours

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine

And so today, your truth has come
You’re gonna pay for what you’ve, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours, you’re out of time
And you will give me back what’s mine
Give me back what’s mine
Give me, give me back what's mine

Give me, give me back what's mine

Than the pain I put you through
And my carelessness left you in the dark

Always just out of reach

Sirens repeat
I've been searching for the courage

I'll fuse it back together

And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony

If my armor breaks

Maxed out so now we finished

Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne

Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads

And now I'm inside with my bro bro's, gang

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised

It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me","Someone to Watch Over Me, song (from Oh, Kay!, musical)"

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

J'suis pas en sparring, moi, j'cogne pour le titre
Ma rime sort du coltard, roule vers la gloire depuis tout petit
C'est ma routine, j'suis l'élu, ce son c'est Poutine

J'm'emporte, l'enfer gellera avant qu'on s'arrache mon pote
Moi pour lâcher la pression, j'ai l'rap
Tu veux que j'ponde des trucs softs dans ma discographie
J'avais déjà le troisième doigt dressé dans l'échographie
Un flow, des poumons d'acier, mon côté peace a fuit
J'suis ma propre taule, seule la faucheuse viendra m'gracier

Comme les tours l'industrie tombe, j'l’ai secouée
Ces cons ils ont retrouvés mon cahier de rimes intact dans les décombres
On revient jouer, c'est ta clarté pour ma noirceur
Les jambes écartées les MCs tiennent leur mic comme un vibromasseur
Avant qu'elle crève, ils enterrent notre zik
Avant que j'l'acheve mon sceud tourne déjà dans la chambre d'un internaute

La rage dans les intestins, s’apprêter au pire
Ouvrir l’œil au jour le jour, fêter en attendant le deuil
C’est couvrir d’un linceul ses craintes, courir
Ma clique, un paquet de soldats avançant comme un seul
C’est mourir un peu dès qu’un des nôtres chute
Nourrir un feu même sous les insultes
C’est croire ou ne pas croire, on porte le foulard ou la croix
Au risque de choquer France, je revendique cicatrices et différences
Hors de la matrice, je secoue tellement la rue qu’elle en vibre
C’est ça, être libre

Vivre libre, briser ses chaînes
Ce qui nous bloque, ce qui nous freine
Libre, Certain que ça en vaut la peine

C’est ne pas aller dans le sens du vent, avoir du franc-parler
Tu vends ton âme ou t’élèves la voix?
J’fais chialer ma plume, à la fois clair et obscur, j’suis paré
Je m’assume moi, je suis le premier à qui je dois plaire
Être libre, c’est goumer même quand faut payer le tarot
Essayer de garder le moral même derrière des barreaux
Connaître le passé, et au présent renaître
C’est les bif’ qui font courir les gens
Où est l’esclave, où est le maître?
Un spliff, un bon à mettre dans le poste et j’quitte ma taule
Esquive le réel, j’vis entre l’enclume et le marteau
Innonde les ruelles, les ondes, je les cribles
Devenir l’inverse de ce qui divise le monde, c’est ça, être libre",Chant Libre
Lino,"Tant que y aura des putes, des macs
Des buts à atteindre, des plaques à prendre
Des paquets de gens qui luttent pour une cause
Des parquets, des jeunes qui chutent aux assises
Tant qu'il reste des minutes avant que ça explose
Tant qu'y aura des banques à braquer
Des tas de choses à dire, des raisons de craquer
De partir en couille en martyr
Tant que y aura des tas de douilles encore fumantes sur le sol
Des patrouilles, tant qu'on aura que la violence comme argument
Tant qu'ils auront pas ma dépouille et que pour se faire entendre faudra se taper
Tant que y aura des ""nègres"" et des ""crouilles"" j'aurai de quoi rapper
On passe pas entre les gouttes, on se mouille
C'est en temps d'paix que l'embrouille se prépare, on sait pas ramper
Tant qu'on dépouillera nos bleds, tant que y aura des délits de sales têtes
Tant qu'on annulera pas la dette de l'Afrique
Tant que la France sera pas prête à voir des tas de bronzés dans son écran
Tant que Marianne m'aura pas astiqué la trique
Tant que rien n'aura changé, chez nous on rêve d'ici
La misère shoot, on a retrouvé le cadavre d'un môme planqué dans la soute
On nous a mutilé
Qui peut l'ignorer?
Suffit pas de décorer le tirailleur pour oublier Goré
Tant que y aura pas de justice en ce qui nous concerne, pas d'unité
Quand on tombe on prend du ferme on a pas l’immunité
Tant que y aura des ghettos dans nos villes, dans nos crânes
Tant qu'ils se rendront compte qu'on existe seulement quand le coin crame
T'as toujours pas compris que nos drapeaux doivent émerger
Petit mouton sors du troupeau assassine le berger
Tant qu'on aura pas le respect qu'on mérite j'rapperai comme un Uzi chante
Je ferai de la musique délinquante

Ce son reflète l'époque, des bloc c'est la bande son

Tant que le président évitera le placard
Évident, tant que je sortirai pas sans blinder le trois quart
Tant qu'on se fera flinguer, tiré à vue de dos ou de trois quarts
Et que j'aurai du mal à distinguer meurtre et bavure
C'est Lima, India, November, Oscar
Pas une gravure de mode, je suis l'image de la haine
Lascar, sur une prod' animale
Que Dieu nous parraine, mon vacarme, ma rime me sortent de l'anonymat
Un mauvais climat règne, on marine dans de l’éther
L'audimat pète, ça saigne comme Tony les narines pleines de coke
On nous enseigne l'art de courber l'échine
Dès le premier biberon à devenir des carburant pour la machine
""Seuls les forts vivront""
Imagine la scène, tant que j'y croirai, qu'un seul vienne les autres suivront
Tant que y aura ces veines que le sort tranche, ces chaînes à nos poignets
De la blanche, de l'héro de la fonce-dé pour s'éloigner
Tant qu'on sera au point zéro à pisser dans la guitare
Tant que y aura des putains de matons, des frères au mitar
Des mères au parloir, des pères brisés, condition trop sale
Visés par la loi, handicapés social
Tant qu'on sera autant à l'aise dans ce ""biz"" que dans le comico
Ils préféreraient me voir avec un flingue plutôt qu'un micro
Tant que y aura le bordel ou ça schlingue
Mon son ira immortel sur disque dingue
Je suis en mode guerre comme en Iraq
Les MC ont de la bile à se faire, regardez vos montres
J'reprends les affaires, et j'm'appuie sur un beat monstre

Lyrics marginaux des taudis, permets que je me fasse une dédicace
La roue tourne, c’est un casino, la vie, c’est ce qu’on dit
On passe par les cuisines de l’enfer pour se poser au paradis
Saisis nos rimes, cousine, écoute mon cœur causer
A chaque prestation, les ondes, je reviens arroser
Les mecs, c’est des pulsations cardiaques, ces kits de batterie
A chaque, poum poum tchak, après l’impact, crie
Je sors de ma crypte, largue le truc
Sur ma vague, viens surfer, c’est réel, c’est pas un clip
On sait pas bluffer, c’est le langage du cœur

On parle le langage du cœur, jamais à demi-mot
Oui tu sais, le langage du cœur fait souvent défaut
(C'est réel, Wallen, L.I.N.O.)
Oui, tu vois, le langage du cœur ne se traduit pas
(On bluffe pas), tu auras beau tendre l'oreille
Soit tu piges, soit tu piges pas

On parle le langage du cœur, ça n’engage que moi
Ma clique, mon microphone, Wallen te le dit dans les chœurs
En cage après 2002, mon adrénaline fuse
J’en ai pour qui veut, sur la ligne, je reste, ma rage, on diffuse
L’instru', je le câline pas, je refuse de me coucher
T’amuses ta galerie, t’es de la baise, excuse, ma langue a fourché
J’apaise tes douleurs en kickant loin des clichés
Expliquant aux petits que c’est l’heure, qu’on a assez négligé le fond
Affiché sur les murs en posters ou niché dans les sonos
Reste toi-même les vrais gangsters font pas de promo
Obligé de le pisser, je peux pas le taire
J’ai que 12 mesures chrono, je termine en espérant que t’aies pigé le truc

Lino,"Les putains de jours passent et se ressemblent
Les tours cachent l’horizon, les spliffs tournent, rassemblent
On fait ses classes dans les cours de prisons
Les soces, la famille, disons que les grosses liasses stimulent
Enterre les amis, souvent on y passe mais la vie continue
Un putain de vice peut en cacher un autre
Il dissimule sa haine, la reum elle, la rue lui a déjà prit un fils
Le daron lui parle comme il cogne mais à force on s’habitue
Sent plus les coups, le cœur béton comme un bout de bitume
Il tue le temps, à moins que ce soit le contraire
Avec ses confrères, dans le crime, il tombe dans tous les pièges que la rue tend
Gratte deux trois rimes de quartiers, sur les shmits et l’état
Enragé, une moitié du temps, et l’autre pété au shit
Il a des rêves, pourtant, des envies d’exil
Guette la carte du monde, relit les lettres de son frangin au placard
Ça dit le vrai luxe c’est être libre, l’homme est pas fait pour la cage
Personne n’est parfait, comme leur dernier braquage
Alors il gamberge, en nage, allongé sur son lit superposé
Pense à changer de berge, les yeux explosés, il pense

Il se lève, prends son ? sous le lit, enroulé dans une veste
Sourit à sa mère, lui fait un geste de la main
Claque la porte, rejoint le reste de l’équipe
Les potes, ça s’engraine, les voix portent, putain venez on sait ou cette pute traîne
La daronne, guette par la fenêtre, regarde son fils partir
Cette nuit, c’est la dernière fois qu’elle entendra parler de lui

Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?

Elle a l’âge des premières fois, l’âge où on teste la vie
L’âge où on aime autant qu’on se déteste
L’âge où le seul avis qu’on aie, c’est celui des autres
Tous dans le même navire, elle était cool avant que sa reum perde les eaux
Tout s’écroule quand ses parents divorcent, les coups
Les rapports de force, plus personne à l’écoute car plus de réseau
Adolescence meurtrie, cicatrice ambulante
Le cœur blessé, prend le premier petit con venu pour une ambulance
Une vie stressée, sans but, sans tarder
Elle donne son petit corps à qui sait la regarder, et encore
C’est une grande pute la vie, elle assemble ses putains d’souvenirs
Elle se rappelle, les nombreuses visites nocturnes
De papa dans sa chambre
Et elle fume, fait le mur, enrage, déjà mure avant l’âge
Attend sa mue après l’orage, ça ne peut qu’être mieux
Elle tombe accro d’un raclo plein de promesses
Tout est OK, jusqu’au jour où elle lui annonce qu’elle est cloquée
Le jour de ses 18 piges, tout est noir ce soir de décembre
On l’a retrouvée dans sa baignoire, baignant dans son sang

Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?

Il a le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang viennent tacher le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Chargé, il guette son visage déformé dans la glace brisée
C’était le fils sage, désormais ses putains de démons le suivent à la trace
D’un monde aseptisé, pousser à réussir très tôt
A viser le top, à vivre les rêves de ses parents, leur véto, oui il en crève
Gosse transparent, éternel premier de la classe
Tout part en couille et se casse, personne n’a rien vu venir
Il se fracasse la tête contre les murs
Passe la plupart du temps seul devant sa glace
Genre, c’est à moi que tu parles?
Génération X, héritier de la violence des aînés
Une étincelle sur une traînée de poudre qui voulait juste être aimée
Des années, à kiffer sur une fouf qui s’en branle, l’étouffe
Il s’en prend à dieu, prie le diable, s’imaginant à deux dans le gouffre
Il a des pulsions meurtrières et veut sortir des ténèbres
Le souffre douleur d’hier, deviendra célèbre
Tristement, Le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang sur le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Les armes chargées de son daron, entassées dans un sac de sport
Il se dirige vers son lycée pour inverser le score
Il arrive, pointe une première cible, et la ça tourne au drame
Et la suite, elle fera la une des journaux

Pour les gosses d’ici, de là-bas, du bled, ou d’ailleurs
Quartiers difficiles ou pas, j’plaide
Qui est coupable quand ça tourne au drame, que le coup part
Y’a même des SOS, dans les cocktails molotov

Lino,"Simples maillons, on est c'que la vie veut qu'nous soyons
Nous sommes des bêtes de somme, maîtres ou esclaves, en somme
Simples lettres, petites ou grosses sommes
Amis ou traîtres, ennemis, peut-être
Ou tout simplement des hommes?
Des âmes perdues sans guides
Nos armes braquent le bonheur, Sésame s’ouvre
Comme la trappe sous nos pieds précipite mon corps dans le vide
Nos Dieux sont en papier et c’est leur amour qui nous suicide
On est frappés par la foudre, comme conduits par un fou
Rattrapés par nos démons, la cervelle brûlée par la poudre
C’est encore loin l'Paradis?
Hé, c’est à combien l'Paradis?
Ce Monde me blesse la rétine
Me laisse aucuns choix d'la tétine à la tombe
À Dieu j'm’adresse certains soirs
Quand j'cherche un peu d'clarté, un sens à cette vie
J'me remémore le quartet, naissance, école, boulot et mort
Où est ma place, mon camp ici, croyant ou athé'?
J'suis à l’abri des missiles, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’ai porté ma croix, maté mon côté sombre, et les trois six
Ecarté le mal, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’suis là, assis seul dans les ténèbres, braquant le ciel du regard
On a l’art d'pisser la douleur quand on est nègre
Le bien a déserté l’écran, on célèbre nos noces de feu
L’argent veut assassiner Dieu, le trône est vacant
Sur toutes les lèvres, on lit la même prière
Mais si on vise
Si l'Tout-Puissant est amour, pourquoi sa parole divise?
Le Monde est à nous, vu qu’on y vit
J'veux crever l’arme au poing et pas à genoux
C’est réel, c’est pas MTV
Y'a rien d'glamour mais j'relativise
J’avoue, la vie, elle a un drôle de sens de l’humour
Parfois, l'long du tunnel, on voit pas l'bout, mec, dans l'ghetto, on craque
Destin tracé comme le fœtus d’une mère défoncée au crack
La foi dans l'Créateur, pas en l’homme et ses légions
Mal comprise, religion devient arme de destruction massive
Ta guerre c’est un braquo, déguisé en juge de cause
Un ange qui ment sous serment, des mômes qu’on arrose pour des gisements d'brut
J'te cause de rêves qui s’écroulent comme les Tours Jumelles
Cette pute de liberté qui perd son rimmel
Dans les rivières d'la haine, coule le sang des martyrs
Quand la peur gagne par KO, la morale repart en civière
Proche du chaos, mon cœur abrite le feu de Lucifer
Mais là-haut, faudra s’y faire, on nous a laissés le libre-arbitre
C’est la canicule, tout s’agite, le Sud encule le Nord
Le sol rougit, on changera pas ce monde à moins d’un paquet d'millions de mort

Vivre et apprendre à mourir
Se battre, vaincre ou rendre les armes
Faire face ou passer son temps à courir
Embrasser l’enfer, lui sourire et succomber à ses charmes
Avancer les poings serrés dans c'Monde
Enterrer sa peine, contrôler son destin
Même si c’est pas ici, ou dans c'Monde
Moi j’y arriverai, même à dos d’un putain d'missile, c’est certain

J'reviens m'livrer, c’est Bors, j'reviens œuvrer
J'rappe comme avec un flingue sur la tempe, tu peux pas mentir
Donc j'dis vrai, on commence à l'sentir, le souffre
Livré à moi-même, j’ai appris à manœuvrer le mic au bord du gouffre
Dans c'putain de Monde, j’étouffe, alors j’écris
Souffle ma trentième de putain d'bougie dans les fourneaux de l’antéchrist
Si je l'bouffe le micro, c’est pour m’arracher autre part
J'commets des crimes musicaux pour arracher l'code barre
Il y a personne pour entendre tes cris? 
T’allumes un brasier
Tu t’équipes. En cas d'conflit, Monsieur Vengeance est pas rassasié

Marche pas avec les putes, guette les schmits si tu deales

Ça claque, j'suis là pour frapper
Sec souvent me hisser au top pour charcler le hip-hop
Attaquer, marquer l'époque et me glisser
C'est propre à nous on fait du sale, c'est pas poli, c'est
J'prends mes balles dans l'alphabet, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L
Qui c'est, c'est L.I.N.O. le L
La douzième lettre, l'alien, le libre penseur

Vite je me soulage l'âme à l'oral
Fêlé, j'suis l'élu m'a dit l'oracle
L'électron libre, j'ai l'aura qui luit sous la lune
Lance des litres de lyrics et les livre comme les lamelles dans l'alu
Pas de larmes sous l'iris, j'ai l'allure d'un 9 millis
Je rap au feeling, illico je file, j'allume, c'est du Kill Billy
Ça fait kill kill, là j'écris l'hymne de la ville
Ça kill kill kill comme Lil W Eazy #AMilli
J'me lâche sur leurs sales styles en leasing en 6 millimètres
Le cash et l'illicite lient les lascars auxquels je m'affilie
O.K. je taff, je milite, le ciel ma limite
Je suis l'élite des ruelles
Sur la liste des lyricistes qui te linchent en 6 lignes
On lave le linge sale en family
Le poids des lettres au kilos, du lourd
Là c'est plus du rap, c'est de l'haltérophilie
En live du lab's, j'largue les textes, j'ai l'inspi' actuelle, pas ex-lutteur

De l'art libre, de l'hémoglobine et des larmes, de la money

Du délit j'suis l'objet, j'suis lu de long en large
Délivre le lion, libère des flows de lave
Leurs livres brûlent, je lâche du lest, c'est mon délire juste avant l'au-delà
J'l'ouvre et le beat hurle, y'a trop de lâches à élire
Au lac j'mets le feu, illégal comme l'ancien collègue à Elie
Laisse-les faire leurs lap-dancing
Chez Lucifer, la haine de l'insigne
J'suis élevé, j'viens mettre le hola
J'l'aime pas sans latex comme Willy La Lope
J'lance l'hymne de la tess, et l'étale comme une diablesse féline
C'est luxe et salopes à l'écran
Des grosses liasses, des lignes blanches, l'enfer, ses délices
Et je lance l'alerte avant qu'mes négros se lassent
La playlist j'lui fait un lifting
C'est lisse et trop classe comme du Céline
L'industrie et moi c'est Lefty et Donnie sans la la
Là j'te lègue ma sale littérature
Loin d'être light et légère
Le level monte, c'est pas du Lalane
T'as pas l'âge légal pour liker mes lyricals low-kicks
T'es un laquet, j'suis en Ligue 1
Depuis Hell On Earth ou L.L.
Juste avant Mickey Mi. L.L
Après Big L et I-L-L-matic y'a Pete Rock et C.L. Smooth
Epoque Lunatic et L432, look Lacoste avant L.V
Live des ruelles, de V.L.B.
L.I.N.O sur L.P. genre le Lucky L.Uciano
Dans l'aile j'ai pas de plomb, moi j'lacère l'agneau
J'écris au laser pour les malheurs sans lèvres
A la nôtre, l'heure j'la donne
De l'ombre à la lueur j'me lève

Pour ceux qui voient la rue comme une mère, mes mots fusent
Au kilo, c'est mon refuge le rap
J'traverse l'Enfer sans ventilo, sans clim'
Macadam philo', Beretta Franklin
Mon arme chante et j'marche seul comme dit l'autre
J'vous laisse rêver d'un monde sans crime
Crevé, j'm'arrache sur mon îlot, douleurs sans cris
J'suis revenu du brasier en footing
J'diffuse mon savoir, j'fais des drives-by shooting
C'est mort ça commence à se voir

Petite guérilla sur un son, bavard, j'suis un nègre en or
Impact de balle en guise de poinçon
J'laisse cogner mes vers, j'attends la pluie de météores
Les remords frappent à visage découvert donc je reconnais mes torts
Et j'appuie où ça fait mal, le fond la forme mon harmonie
Y'a plus qu'des Tony, Many, Nino et Gee Money
L'amitié s'monnaie, l'amour se planque dans un bar à hôtesses
La liberté à Osny, loin de nos tess'
J'te rappe les chroniques d'un drame annoncé vu que mon art proteste
Avec la même ironie qu'un canon-scié
Mon nid je l'ai fait dans une cible avant de partir au bout du monde
Genre missile j'trace déter comme un martyr au bout d'une bombe
La place j'éclaire, ça tire, je crache du plomb
J'ai grandi cité carter, entre l'truand et l'bon
Avant qu'on me la retire la vie, j'écris à l'encre de mes artères
La foudre j'attire, j'irai au paradis en charter
J'ai le Peter Pan syndrome mais sans la berceuse S.V.P
Cherche l'assassin de mon enfance avec un pompe sur l'siège bébé
Musique à tête chercheuse, j'rêve d'une bombe à la Fashion Week
Trop en avance j'ai mon LP dans la Playstation 8
Puis FPP, on blesse apprenti punchliner
Pas facile de me faire l'œil du tigre avec du eyeliner

Rap Call Of Duty en ce qui me concerne, j'adoucis pas les titres
C'est pas du Polanski, ma 'zique touche pas les p'tites
J'suis pas venu parler fric, j'ai pris la pilule rouge à Morpheus
Une mèche, du plastic j'fais du Wolfgang Amadeus

La rue fait ""Oui"" de la tête à chaque mesure que je crache
Ça pue le classique, un son de crapules
Wolfgang, Wolfgang
Le beat on l'plastique, j'cache une menace sous la capuche
L'ambiance la brûle
Wolfgang, Wolfgang
'Zique de parias, les rats des blocks en redemandent
Wolfgang, ça reste basique les rats des blocks en redemandent, eh!
On fait dans le tragique, j'compose des gros concertos en Do majeur
Wolfgang, Wolfgang, Wolfgang!

Si les hommes naissent pour mourir, mes requiems sont des berceuses
Les flammes j'les nourris, j'écris des missives à têtes chercheuses
Prêt à faire feu, le disque est sur la rampe de lancement
Un beat nerveux, un sample comme au commencement
Mon nom sur le missile, ça semble étrangement
Calme ici comme avant l'orage
Du verbe, des homicides, tous mes vieux démons font plus leur âge
J'atteins mes cibles, j'rappe, fauche les mots, le groove on l'aime sec
J'serais une légende vivante si j'étais mort au 18ème siècle
Mais j'sais pas mourir faut l'admettre, j'suis lucide et pas pressé
Comme si j'écrivais ma lettre de suicide sur mon avis de décès
J'ai pris des coups pour une vie parfaite sans les menottes et l'palier
Mon dégoût de la défaite est plus violent qu'mon envie de gagner
J'viens pour brûler la fête, maintenant le feu tu sais qui l'a mis
J'prends pas ma retraite, j'leur passe le relais,
C'est un bâton de dynamite
Kick, charley, gros tsunamis dans un verre de vodka sec
La rue m'admire depuis l'époque du poste cassette
De l'art de la douleur t'entendras pas mon microphone gémir
Y'a les génies, les escrocs, moi j'suis un escroc de génie!
Un accroc dans leur plans j'leur ai mise vu qu'ils veulent qu'on cesse
Les meilleurs partent en premier sauf quand il est question de sexe

So lock the doors and call me yours

Linton Garner,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Linton Garner,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again

Two friends, but one broken heart

Linton Garner,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
"Linton J. Smith, Jr.","From the moment You opened my eyes
I have seen the world in a different light
From the dawn to the setting sun
I am overwhelmed
By all that You have done

Adore, adore, adore
Jesus I adore you,
Yes I adore,
Adore, adore, adore
Jesus, I adore You
And I lay my life before You, O Lord

There's a union of two becoming one
Deep inside my heart
I know that I belong
You have given everything to me
The least that I can do
Is give it back to you

And all I am and ever will be
Is for You, Lord
And everything within me cries

Adore, adore, adore
Jesus, I adore you,
Yes I adore you
And I lay my life before You

Linton Kwesi Johnson,"To us
Who were
Of necessary birth
For the earths hard
And thankless toil
Silence has no meaning

There is never a feeling
Of tranquility
Or mere quietness
Never a moment
Of soundless calm
From within or without
Our troubled selves

How can the clamor
Of sounds be stilled?
There is no void where
Noises can collect
And be made mute

How indeed
Can there be silence

When our hearts beat out
A sonorous beat
Meeting the beating drums
Of an African past
When our eyes shed
Solid tears of iron blood
That falls on concrete ground

Inside our ears
Are the many wailing cries
Of misery
Inside our bodies
The internal bleeding
Of volcanoes
Inside our heads
The wrapped in thoughts
Of rebellion

How can there be calm
When the storm is yet to come?

This unending silence
Taut, impervious, unbending
Not lending an ear
To the most delicate of sounds
Awaits the blast of bombs
Which man will explode
To break this silent bond
To (?)
To the use to create
Hills of soft obedience
Where sweet-clothed sounds
Can rebound
And their echoes glide
Like a carefree bird
In rhythmic calm
To a mellow

Underneath a sky of green and blue

We'll find where we belong
The kind of life we dream of is waiting
When we start a whole new country
And only we can come

Taking sips of sweet champagne
Making love beneath the yellow moonlight
Holding hands and ""I love you""'s

Will pull you right in:

So why don't we walk awhile
Why don't we talk a little while
It's only a crazy idea that I had
What if it ain't so bad?""

Now that we've come to be friends
Let's travel this road a bit further
And see where it ends
With confident flair I proceed
Watch how one innocent question
Will get what I need:

""Oh what a beautiful night...
So why don't we kiss awhile
Something like this a little while
It's only a crazy idea that I had
What if it ain't so bad?""

Raide comme un I plus ou moins Grec 
Au bord d' la falaise des mensonges 
Je compte les baisers rouges pastèques
Les baisers rouges qui me rongent. 
Histoires d'ego et d'parano, 
De p'tits câlins et de gros mots. 
Paroles d'amour, histoires de cul, 
Me voilà cuite, mais qui l'eût cru?

Malaise sur la falaise, il ne reviendra pas, c'en est arrivé là
Malaise sur la falaise, il ne reviendra pas, c'en est arrivé là 

Une histoire, ça peut être bien 
Mais une histoire, ça a une fin.

Y'a un malaise après l' dessert
Une histoire, ça peut être bien 
Mais une histoire, ça a une fin
Comme un repas d'anniversaire
Y'a un malaise après l' dessert

Malaise sur la falaise, est-ce le vent qui ment?

Lion's Share,"As a break of dawn came closer
My hopes seemed so forlorn
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all
My despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue

A flash in the night
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name
The scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within

A flash in the night
And my despair was caught in motion

Lion's Share,"I saw her standing by the shore
Her eyes they looked so sad
Never seen her like this way before

She felt a pain behind her eyes
Burning inside
Pictures flashing by, memories
On the rise

Could it be shadows from her past
She tries to understand, they're

Fading fast
The visions took her by surprise
She fell on her knees, terror
In disguise

Could it be shadows from her past
She tries to understand, they're
Fading fast
Could this be shadows from the past
She tries to understand but
They don't last

In the dark voices calling, calling
To her in her dream
And she feels like there is something
Trying to break through

Strait-jacket keeps her
Safe and sound
Burning inside
Her eyes are looking sad
The world is spinning round

Lion's Share,"We had no warning, now it's too late
The earth is trembling, is this our fate how
Long will it take? before all is lost lost,
There's no mistake shall every angel fall
We watch them turn into flames

into the heat, out of the night no end is
Yet in sight could it be? it's the end of all light

I see them falling all around me
Scorched by the fire, wings are burning

into the heat, out of the night no end is
Yet in sight could it be? it's the end of all light

to heaven I gaze the angels are
Descending and now as they fall from
Grace we pray and start repenting the
Heaven I face in awe, they are descending
And now as they fall from grace we pray

and start repenting I hear the people chanting his name
Without hope, within the dark no one else to blame all
We feel is fear and shame

All your dreams like a fading flower
Fade away to die
Now all your visions have left you
All your hope is gone

You don't need to hide

You will receive

Don't give up the fight
You can make it right

Just to stay alive
And though it seems like you've lost it
You will find a way

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Lionel Hampton,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy,
When they see you out with me.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips.

Lionel Hampton,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Lionel Hampton,"Chillun', listen here to me
This is my philosophy
To see me through the day
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
All God's Chillun got swing
Maybe haven't got money
Maybe haven't got shoes

Lionel Hampton,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Lionel Hampton,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love
Lionel Hampton,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Lionel Hampton,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

Lionel Hampton,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Yet, every night,

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Lionel Hampton,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Lionel Hampton,"I see trees of green........ red roses too
I see 'em bloom..... for me and for you
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue..... clouds of white
Bright blessed days....dark sacred nights
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world.

The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky
Are also on the faces.....of people ..going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin'.. how do you do
They're really sayin'......i love you.

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more.....than I'll never know
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world

Spinning Wheel got to go 'round

Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn

On the straight and narrow highway

Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see

Lionel Hampton,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for

With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Lionel Hampton,"Life's a game, but who can play it all alone
Ev'ry chap should hold a heart that's all his own
Love may come at first sight, they told me
When I saw you, I knew
That I had found my only love
When I found you

So, darling, I know that you know
That I'll go where you go
I choose you, won't lose you
I wish you knew how much I long to hold you in my arms

This time is my time
T'will soon be goodbye time
Then in the star light, hold me tight

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

Lionel Hampton,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

One of those bells that now and then rings

When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things

When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky
How I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, oh baby please
Pull yourself together, got to do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling
Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so crazy mama

Lionel Hampton,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Lionel Hampton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Lionel Hampton,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Lionel Hampton,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow

So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day

What are my arms for?

Lionel Hampton,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Lionel Hampton,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Lionel Hampton,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?

Will you return?

It's terribly sad but true,

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

Lionel Hampton,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Lionel Hampton,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Lionel Hampton,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there

Lionel Richie,"Are you feeling down, and lonely.
Feeling like you can't go on.
Just remember love will find a way.

Tell me are you going through changes.
Time seems like it's passing by.
Just believe that love will find a way.

[Chorus]
I see the tears you cry.
I see the pain that's in your eyes.
So many times you were so lonely.
And no one seemed to care.
But if your hopes, for your tomorrows.
Are drowning in your sorrows.
Know your heart will show you the way.

Are you trying to find a beginning.
Or something just to hold on to.
Always know that love will find a way.

Is it hard this life you're living.
Does the world seem so unkind.
Don't you worry love will find a way.

[Chorus]

Some say we've lost, our way.
Some say the world has gone astray.
But if you know where you're going.
There's nothing you can't do.
'Cause problems will come.
And they will leave you.
The world will try to deceive you.
But the truth will always be in your soul.",Love Will Find a Way
Lionel Richie,"Let me tell you now
All that's on my mind.
For a love like yours.
Is oh, so very hard to find.
I've looked inside myself.
Now I'm very sure.
There can only be, you for me.
I need you more and more

[Chorus]
You, turned me inside out and you showed me.
What life was about.
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.
I want to do all I can, just to show you.
Make you understand.
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.

When you're in my arms.
When I'm close to you.
There's a magic in your touch.
That just comes shining through.
Want you everyday.
Want you every night.
There can only be, you for me.
You make it seem so right.
Oh, girl, cause

You, turned me inside out and you showed me.
What life was about.
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.

In my mind, there's no other love.
You're the only girl my heart and soul is thinking of.
Only you, only me.
There can never ever be another.
That understands the way that I feel inside, 
Cause

(you stole my heart away)
You stole it. (you stole my heart away)
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.
Yeah you, (you stole my heart away)

Lionel Richie,"The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
(We were running, running with the night)
 
You were looking so good girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt

[Bridge]
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town
