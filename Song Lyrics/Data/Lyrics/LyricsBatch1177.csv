Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"How can I deny this feeling?
Can't use the fuse that lights the spark
Don't think I'll hold out too much longer

The lines are blurred in the dividing
I deserve light, I desire dark
Your influence is getting stronger

Defined by mind, my body is too curious
So won't you show me all there is to know?

I know I shouldn't call
But something makes me crave the heat
Your love is bittersweet (so here I am)
The fire in your touch
I always find so hard to beat
Your love is bittersweet (so here I am)

No substitute for real pleasure
You feed the need that lies in me
I've lost all sense to this devotion

One touch and there's a rush of electricity
So won't you show me all there is to know?

I know I shouldn't call
But something makes me crave the heat
Your love is bittersweet (so here I am)
The fire in your touch
I always find so hard to beat
Your love is bittersweet (so here I am)

One touch and there's a rush of electricity
So won't you show me all there is to know?
Anytime you call my name",Bittersweet
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I never saw this coming
Since the beginning you were in control
And now my heart is drumming
Believe this love could maybe save my soul

I hear a voice out of the silence
That can always bring me home

Don't let me go
Now I'm right where I want to be
Don't let me go
You cut straight to the heart of me

Forever want for nothing
Caught in a place where I'm released from fear
So in my dreams I'm running
Towards the light that came and brought us here

I hear a voice out of the silence
That can always bring me home

Don't let me go
Now I'm right where I want to be
Don't let me go
You cut straight to the heart of me

The heart of me
Straight through the heart of me",Cut Straight to the Heart
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"When it's late at night
I am your agenda
When you hope to find
I'm alone

A coward's way to speak your verse
A hidden message, broken words
I read out lines but the truth may hurt
I am only killing time with you

You don't understand
You don't know how I feel
And so for what it's worth
I wanna keep it real

If you dial my number
It's not enough
You can wait and wonder
If there's an ""us""
And when it's dead on the line
Do you think, ""The girl is mine""?
You know I'm not falling under
I'm not in love

In the depths of your mind
You think I'll surrender
When you're lost at sea
I'm on land

It's only fair I set you right
'Cause what we have won't see daylight
It's just for now so enjoy the ride
I'm having fun killing time with you

You don't understand
You don't know how I feel
And so for what it's worth
I wanna keep it real

If you dial my number
It's not enough
You can wait and wonder
If there's an ""us""
And when it's dead on the line
Do you think, ""The girl is mine""?
You know I'm not on a number
I'm not in love

Yeah, you can dream about it
But don't believe it's real at all",Dial My Number

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I see the way that you look at him
What makes you think that he's yours to win
You're showing off just trying to catch his eye

I know the tricks, it makes me sick inside

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Love was cold, just a memory
Was a slave to my history
So long, too long

Through the silence I heard you call
My defenses began to fall
I'm yours, all yours

I need your love to warm me like a sun
Inside my heart, I still believe in magic
Without your touch, don't know what I become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic

No more shadows, you gave me light
Woke me up, brought me back to life
Won't be lonely again

In a trance, I'm oblivious
All that's left is the two of us
Right here, right now, always

I need your love to warm me like a sun
Inside my heart, I still believe in magic
Without your touch, don't know what I become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic

Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe in magic [whispered]

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Though I can't get out
Trapped inside of it
I won't let go
Pain keeps driving it

I only hope and pray
That I can make it pay
Keep pushing, it
I keep pushing on

I did the best I could
I learned to sacrifice
I tried to make it work
This time away has done me good
It's a change, from you

You thought I'd be free forever

No I can't turn back,
I'm sick and tired of it
When love broke down
I rewired it

I'm only human babe
You let the feeling fade
Keep pushing
Till I reach a higher ground

I tried to make it back
When every door was closed
Your love was all I had
I tried to make an honest man
Woo ooh
Out of you

Wired to the sun with a laser beam
Power surge, come feel the energy
And I'm ready to shine and shine and shine and shine:..

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Hold a moment in time
And look to the skies
And we are frozen in light
Not a second goes by

Is it a waking dream holding me?
You never really know till you know
In the blink of an eye
Hearts will unite

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die, right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, starlight
Oh! 'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

No silhouette in my mind
It's just you and I
And as the starlight shines
Bodies are blind

Here till the end

Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die, right here in your arms

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"A winter morning black as any night
A landscape held in time under the ice
There's a house on the hill
She's living there still
Rooms are full of pictures black and white

So the story goes, she lives alone
The company is framed in monochrome
She keeps them alive
Long after they've died
No one ever knows until they're gone

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories

I once went to her door when I was young
The spell to be her subject was too strong
Now from here behind glass
I see more fools pass
Flies caught in the secret web she's spun

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories

Every photograph is a cenotaph
Won't you stay here a while
In a flash you'll see, you belong to me
All I need is a smile

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories

Stand still evermore
Pose for eternity with me
Your soul on my wall
Love is a camera full of memories

Run run away, from the house on the hill
There's a witch in the house
And she's living there still

Run run away, from the house on the hill

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I could tie up the bed sheets and slide down the house 
Be gone before the morning comes 
I could dye my hair, I could change my name 
Leave it all behind, be free to run 

When I close my eyes I'm on the other side 
I'm like a hurricane along the track 
I see the landscape's wild from here inside my mind 
Beyond the walls which always hold me back

Running away 
Girls gotta have a little daydream 
It's a secret escape 

It's just my imagination 
Running away 
Don't worry baby 
I'm here to stay 

The noise of the city and the neon sky 
It will fade with the falling down 
And the quiet gets too close to me 
So won't you come and bring me around? 

Little slice of paradise in the back of my eyes 
I don't need it to be true 
‘Cause we all seek shelter from the darker days

If I'd been a phoenix, raise us up through embers and flames

Was a chance to let it grow

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they've grown
No loving is left

Of the sun

If I'd been a loaner I would save myself, stay unaware
If I'd been a dreamer I would float away in a dream

But the seasons, they were sleeping
And the fates were on our side
And only summer eternal
Never harvest or survive

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they're gone
No loving is left
Stand in the wrong side
Of the sun

We never thought to keep pushing it
We thought the sun would be forever long
She took him til the colors faded
And it was too late then to run and hide

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they've grown
Our love's over now
Oh how did it go so very wrong?

We watched as the heat slit through our skin
Our hearts to expose the end to them

About the night

When the room is dark
And you let it go
The watching shows
And talk through the walls
When the sheets
Have got you warm

Say it's all in my mind

It's beginning to drag me down
I've got to change, my wishes
I've got to stop wanting, wanting you here

I've got to do something about the dreaming
It leaves the day the loss of been touched
I've got to discover some other meaning
And I've got to stop wanting you so much

I've got to stop, got to stop the exploding
It's taking too much sense off me
I've got to change my thinking
Because it blinds me and blinds the right way to see

I've got to stop saving
The abundance becomes a shame without you
I've got to give up the believing
I've got to stop hoping but that's so hard to do

I make your wisdom
I make you fall
From your resistance

I will think
That I'm just too late
I will think hard
That it has nothing to do with me

So I'm leaving
While I'm stronger
I'm leaving

I make your wisdom
I make you fall
From your resistance

Is no life anymore
It's time to praise the memories
And put them wherever they can grow

So you live in the stars now
You live in the meads
I'll spread you with my heart
Over the fertile fields

The love we gave each other
Was the love that we would make
Those years became our lifetime
A lifetime faith would break

Now you're living in the oceans
In the trees, in the air
It's a precious burden
The cross we've come to bear

This burden is a precious burden
As precious as you
Brought into my world

That deep inside

Why would I turn around for you?
The truth has faded into a lie
Among all things that I could do

I obviously still bother you, why do I?

Maybe it was the sunrise

I was under the sun

And with the vision

I know that it was rare

The moment, in loving life too much
Every time you're lost in love
You wonder when the love will stop

I'm lost in love

There's a price to pay if you
Want to enjoy the present time
To be that thankful demands that you
Are always carrying death in mind

Death is around

There's a point to put off some things
And save them for a rainy day
Only those about to die
Are acting in a perfect way

Who wants to die

There's an answer to why you can
So rarely take in what you see
The pleasure is followed by
A fear you want to avoid to feel

I'm so lost in love

There's a freedom in making plans
To think about a future and
There's a comfort in being sure
That it'll be long before the end

I'm not making plans

There's a reason to why so many
Only get one little chance
If the song was sung forever
No one'd ever stop to dance

Said the hard man from above
I made you to a giver and a savor
But also to a loser of love

Made your heart big enough to carry
Every kind of pain
I made you to a dream for marriage
But also to someone I must drain

I gave your eyes the color of an ocean
Where anybody could drown
I'd swear an oath on your sterling friendship
But I will always let you down

In storms and rain, it's hard to light the candle
And I'm sorry when it's snowing on his stone
The gravel-walk's so familiar with your footsteps

I find you in the darkness
Where lightness means less
Times when we're
In need of touching
Are when tears
Could get there before
We are walking with pain
When we've seen
People we adore
The things we're
Calling secrets
Are usually the way in
We go to sleep
With the knowledge
That each mind has sins
Times when we are lifted
The fall feels so high
We cry over beauty
It hurts to smile
My way is your way
Your way is mine
My way is your way
Your way is mine",Your Way
Sophie Zelmani,"If it wasn't the oceans,
Wasn't the breezes,
Wasn't the white sands,
I might not be needed.

If I could sleep through the coal mines,
If I could breathe through hatred,
If I could, work through the summer,
Then I wouldn't feel so humble,

Oh you, it's always you,
It's always you.

If red roses weren't so lovely,
Wine didn't taste so good,
Stars weren't so romantic,
Then I could do what I should.

Oh you, it's always you,
It's always you.
Oh you, it's always you,
It's always you

If you love, I could command it,
Get your head, to understand it,
I'd go twice, around the world,
Even though, I may not find it.

Oh you, it's always you,
It's always you.
You, it's always you,
It's always you.",Always You [Ten Years Later]
Sophie Zelmani,"You were in the city, one night all alone, 
Just waiting for a tax that could take you home, 
You saw a man walking down the street, 
Towards you, 
And you could see he had no teeth in his upper jaw 
He had dirt in his hair, he had dirt everywhere, 
His clothes didn't fit and one eye was hit, 
He asked you if you had a minute to talk, 
You said you didn't talk to strangers and you started to walk 
His eyes looked sad and he asked you why, 
You acted like this, 
Was it because he looked so bad, 
I know I scare you, but I just wanted to say, 
That you're the most beautiful I've seen today 
You said, thank you very much, 
But please now leave me alone, 
He said where are you going, 
You said I'm going home, 
Oh please would you invite me to your house sometime, 
You have just seen mine, it's here on the ground 
He took a bottle from his jacket and he said cheers, 
And you felt it was gone, that feeling of fear, 
You said, what happened to you, how could you end up like this, 
You must have had your choices, so tell me what this is 
He said, you don't know a thing about me, 
All you know is only what you see, 
Even if I've lost the most of my brain, 
I still can see the sun and I can feel when it rains 
I tried to be friendly, I tried to be nice, 
But you turned me your back and you were as chilly as ice, 
I didn't ask you for money, I asked you for words, 
It's not my life that bothers, it's the way you act that hurts 
You said you were sorry, but how could you know, 
What someone like him, suddenly could do, 
But then you talked until the taxi arrived, 
You said you had to go, you said goodbye 
There's only one thing, I want to tell you before you go, 
I know you want to get home, I know you do, 
I just wanted to tell you, I just wanted to say, 
That I'll remember your smile this day....",You and Him

Sopor Aeternus,"Seinem Geiste bekenne ich mich,
ein Sehnen verzehret sein schönes
Gesicht,
daß, ermattet, von Güte beschattet, allmächtig ist.
Sein Körper
bewegt sich nicht...-
I'm Traume sich endlich sein Zwingen vergißt.
Den heulenden Jubel erkenne ich nicht,
der mir den heiligen Frieden
zerbricht.
Sein schweigender Mund, seine schlafende Brust

Sein Körper bewegt sich nicht...-

Sopor Aeternus,"Nothing in this world 
Can be as immaculate and pure
As the love of us Cold Ones for the dead.  
Our love lives only in those fleeting moments 
Of recollection
Memories we're fearing to forget.

Our love knows neither kiss nor touch, 
We are embracing dust, air or ourselves 
When visualizing what we've lost. 
Awoken by a sound or scent,  
Some visions call sad phantoms, floating, 
Wrapped in fading colours our  lament. 

And then there is the all-devouring dread: 
""some day I might not bring  him back..., 
When my feeble mind can't help but lose 
The contours of his face"".  
Lost forever, lone and sad, 
Gone forever to the dead...
So far beyond the barriers of the opposite space.

Yet, alas, despite it all
Walking through these deserted  halls
It's easy, still, to love the dead
It's easier to love the dead.",Transfiguration
Sopor Aeternus,"From far beyond the veil of sleep 
some ancient voice does seem
to whisper my forgotten name 
weakly, yet solemnly. 

So remotely that one might think
it had been but a dream, 
echo of some illusive call 
of fleeting memory.

Yes, to believe such vain idea
no problem it would be,
if there was not this inscrutable
unrest within me... 

As if out of the deepest sea 
some creature seeks to rise, 
to wish its long denied existence 
back into my life. 

My secret name is whispered 
by a half-forgotten sigh 
and out of nothing, across my face,    
which is all petrified. 

Hot tears are running without end. 
A deeply troubling pain 
pulls me together inwardly, 
to be no more the same... 

From far beyond the veil of sleep 
some tune, ne'er before heard, 
is trav'lling on a fragile breath,    
to shake my frozen world.",Across the Bridge

Vois la misère du monde
Et ta place dans tout ça

Prenons conscience de la chance qu'on a
Et tu verras peut-être
Que la vie est belle!

Blacko, Soprano!

Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres, on ne réalise pas tant que ça ne nous touche pas
On sait très bien ce qu'il se passe ailleurs mais on ose se plaindre
Relativise, ferme les yeux et imagine toi
Tu verras comme ta vie est belle!

C'est Sopra M'Baba, bordélique ambulant pour les mecs d'en bas
Flow décalé pour les mecs qui ne comprennent pas que ça vient d'Massilia
Dédicacé à Psy4tra, dédicacé à La Swija, dédicacé à M.I.N.O et à la miss L.E.A
Qui t'as dit que les mecs des blocs n'étaient pas civilisés? (Oh)
Qui t'as dit que les mecs des blocs ne savaient pas s'amuser? (Oh)
Passe moi un mic et des baffles, une paire de Nike, un beat et une basse
Que je lâche des phases de marque pour les braves
qui débarquent des blocs pour écouter du rap
(Chaud, chaud bouillant)
Les quartiers nord sont tous dans la place
(Chaud, chaud bouillant)
Les Marseillais prennent toute la place
Ils veulent du rap animal, MC normal que t'aies mal
Mon rap s'écoute dans les prides
Le tien dans les gay-prides
J'ai à peine pris le mic que tu commences à faire la shahad
Normal je ballade ma rime, me ballade dans les hit-parades
So-Pra-Ano pour les mecs qu'on a mis au cachot
Pour les mecs qu'on la force de porter la grosse vie d'un mec du ghetto
Bédo à la bouche très tôt, une mère qui se couche très tard
Un père qui n'a plus le contrôle sur un fils qui finira au mitard
Métro, boulot et dodo, c'est ce qu'est la vie du ghetto
Donc laisse moi chauffer mes potos
A faire des po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po

Tout le monde vise, tout le monde en joue

A toujours le phrasé pour les crânes rasés un peu trop bronzés (Quoi quoi quoi quoi)
Qui croyait que le rap était mort, regarde le Top before
Demande à Link Up, What For comment va leurs disques?
Tes enfants s'en battent les couilles de tes chanteurs de pop
Ils écoutent Tandem, Psy4, Sefyu et ma man Sinik
Ils veulent que ça kick, ils veulent de vrais artistes

Un pour ceux de notre brûlante génération, deux pour la cramitude
Partis attitude à l’accélération, Soprano, Lucianozi

Suffit pas d'être vrai faut le rester
Faut plus de courage que d’expérience et de respect
C'est la loi du plus fort sur les plus faible, les vies n'ont plus de freins
Qui veut durer doit faire (?) à celui qu'a le plus faim
Si t'as le temps mon frère fonce c'est le grand jour ouvre les yeux
Y a pas d'avenir dans le crime les jeunes claquent plus vite que les vieux
Je viens du quartier et je connais les règles, c'est du marche ou crève
Défendre de vrais valeurs
Le monde est monde est à nous comme dans tes putains de rêves
Le monde d'aujourd'hui nous oblige à être forts
Car la peur et la prison du cœur
Et qui craint la vie, vit comme un mort
Quartiers chauds en première ligne, vrai pour de vrai
Du mauvais coté ou du bon coté du calibre
On garde la foi l'instinct sauvage des grands fauves
Dis hamdoullah même quand c'est pas la grande forme
Notre reflet reflète ce que nous sommes
On trouve les nerfs en prenant route sombre, plus rien nous stoppe
Putain de monde instable dans mon crâne c'est Woodstock

Quoi que l'époque t'impose
Reste fort digne et vrai pour de vrai
Juste fais-le

Je viens tatouer mes feuilles pour faire évader mes frères de taule
Mon bloc c'est Fox River avec des paraboles
Je suis qu'un jeune rêveur dans ce pays nazis
Où c'est dur de garder son calme avec des Sarko Materrazi
On m'as dit résiste fais ton truc, mais sois dur
Ici le poids d'une auréole peut te briser la nuque
C'est avec le regret des anciens que je m’éduque
Et grâce à ça aujourd'hui, mon bic me sert d'oléoduc
Pour combattre mes doutes, je fais des pompes sur un tapis de prière
La voix c'est le visa de toutes les frontières donc je lutte
Pour être meilleur qu'hier
Pour voir mon avenir sur un hamac mais pas sur une civière
Écoute, le vie est dur si on veut du rêve
On veut tous une part du gâteau mais être le seul à y trouver la fève
Donc lève-toi et sois un dalleux sache que le bonheur
Est une décision qui se prend donc juste fais le

On sourit avec l'envie de faire mal cachée derrière
Affronte la vie présente en préparant la vie dernière
On pardonne mais se rappelle car l'histoire se répète
Si on oublie le passé ouvrez les portes notre destinée appelle
Vrai car un jour vaut cher
On a besoin que nos proches soient prés
Car dans le monde comme on le voit la famille c'est de l'or en chair
On est pas ce qu'on est on devient vrai
Quartier chaud danger
Pour les nôtres gueule d'agneau
Pour les autres l’œil du berger

On fait la fête car tout va mal dans nos têtes
Normal envers Allah on s’entête
On claque notre temps à faire des truc bêtes, mec
On utilise que les neurones de notre zgeg
On se prend la tête que quand les billets ont la couleur à Shrek
Faut qu'on arrête, d'assumer ses désirs plus que ses devoirs
De partager ses péchés plus que son savoir
Faut essayer d’être vrai pour de vrai
Donc pour la famille se mettre a œuvrer

Soprano,"Bonsoir à toutes et à tous,
Bienvenus à notre réunion hebdomadaire des mélancoliques anonymes.
Réservons un accueil particulièrement chaleureux aux nouveaux,
Pour qui ça n'a certainement pas été facile de venir jusqu'à nous.
Nous allons débuter cette réunion par un témoignage.
Qui veut se lancer?

Moi

Toi? Et bien nous t'écoutons

Merci,
Bonsoir je m'appelle Saïd

Bonsoir Saïd

J'ai 27 ans et je suis mélancolique
Je suis de ces artistes qui écrivent leur vie
Comme on laisse une dernière lettre prés d'une boite de prose à vide
Ça a été très difficile pour moi de venir ici
D'accepté ma dépendance à la mélancolie
Le déclic a été de voir ma mère recraché en larme
Tous ce qu'elle a bu de mes bouteilles à la mer
Je m'en veux de la voir si triste
Alors qu'elle n'a jamais été la lame de mes cicatrices
Ni personne de ma famille d'ailleurs
Mais leur tailleur est noir à chaque fois qu'ils écoutent mes disques
J'ai pris le risque de faire de la musique
D'étaler ma vie au public pour soigner un mal de vivre
Je prend conscience de mon égoïsme
Quand je vois comment ils subissent le succès de mes lyrics
Je remplis mes vers de rimes mélancoliques
Et ma voie frise le coma italique sur-rythmique
J'aime la pression qui mousse mes thèmes
Un ivrogne qui s'empègue avec des paques de peines

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Au début je rappais pas pour en vivre
On rappait tous dans un bloc autour d'un poste pour le délire
Je partais en impro, j’enchaînais les mots
J'allumais le mic et ma bouche était un chalumeau
Je taffais mes jeux de mots
Je ne dormais plus
Toutes mes nuits étaient blanches pour que mes feuilles ne le soit plus
Je fesais rire mes potes grâce au petit robert
Mais tout à changé depuis qu'on ma volé le rôle de père
J'ai eu mal au point de vouloir me couper les veines
Fallait me voir poser je t'aime à la haine
Fallait entendre ma mère pleurer toute la nuit
À cause des coutumes qui on poussé mon père à la polygamie
C'est vrai que je suis sorti de l'ombre
Mais le monde est tellement stone que je ne pouvais écrire que ""la colombe""
Plus tu grandit moins tu sourit
Le temps souffle et détruit
Ces châteaux du sable qu'on avait construit
Vous savez aujourd'hui une femme m'a mis en cure
Depuis j'ai moins de degrés dans mon écriture
Je suis moins en état de tristesse
Mais je fais toujours autant péter ce putain de mélancotest

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Merci beaucoup Saïd. Merci pour ce témoignage.
Quelqu'un d'autre peut être veut prendre la parole?

Moi je veux bien

Nous t'écoutons.

Bonsoir je m'appelle Mélanie

Bonsoir Mélanie

J'ai 26 ans et je suis mélancolique aussi
Je suis de ces jeunes filles qui haïssent leur vie
Artiste malgré moi parce que les psy' ont faillit à leurs titre
Depuis toujours le mal de l'encre me démange
L'amour me manque mais me dérange
Alors je chante mes cicatrices",Mélancolique Anonyme
Soprano,"Oh wow oh
Talk to me

Oh wow oh
Talk to me

Fils, si aujourd'hui j'te parle à travers ce disque
C'est pour que tu puisses savoir que ton père existe et qu'il s'appelle Saïd
J'suis triste depuis que ta mère t'as mis à la DASS sans me le dire
Sans que je puisse te voir vu que t'es né sous X
J'sais pas si t'es encore en vie en tout cas jour et nuit j'prie
Pour que chaque Février tu puisses souffler sur tes bougies
J'réagis souvent comme un temps de pluie quand je vois un gosse de ton âge
Et dire t'as 8 ans aujourd'hui
A l'heure où j'écris c'texte les tentatives pour te retrouver on été un échec
Mais j'lache pas le steak j'te le prouverai un jour j'serai
Devant toi avec des années d'cadeaux à rattraper
Même si je sais que j'recuperai jamais les années qu'elle m'a volé
Avant j'comprenai pas quand mon père me prenait la tête
Quand il savait pas où j'étais et maintenant je sais c'est quoi d'être inquiet
J'passe mes nuits au fond d'une couette les yeux ouverts à ma demander si t'es au chaud
Quand arrive ces terribles hivers
J'mange très peu quand j'sais pas si tu manges à ta faim
Et j'pleure en écoutant ""Comme un fils"" de Corneille l'orphelin
Au volant d'ma caisse, sur la corniche, je n'rêve pas de d'vnir riche
Mais plutôt, de te dire ""Ich liebe dich""

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Moi mon gabarit est celui d'un coton tige, ton grand-père l'était aussi
Mais il a grossi depuis ses 50 piges, j'te le dit direct tu seras maigre
Fais pas comme moi, fais des pompes pour qu'une femme te dise que t'as des pecs
Envoies pêtre, ceux qui te pointeront du doigt parce que t'es noir
T'es Comorien, là bas la lune allume la ville quand il fait noir
J'y suis allé qu'une seule fois, à 14 ans
C'est une île paradisiaque ton arrière grand-père était encore vivant
A 19 ans, j'ai eu le BAC après l'avoir raté une fois
Puis j'ai fait 2 ans de BTS mais c'n'était pas ma voie
J'pensais qu'à la rime, qu'à sortir des disques
Depuis j'l'ai fait en remplissant des salles et en faisant des sacrifices
Mon caractère, j'suis plutôt timide, j'suis d'nature solitaire
Et j'regarde le monde avec un œil humide
Ta mère on m'a dit qu'elle a refait sa vie, avec des mecs avec qui
Elle ma trompé pendant 9 ans de ma vie
Tu sais, si t'es comme moi va falloir que t’apprennes à souffrir
Car j'suis de ceux qui donnent de l'amour sans réfléchir
Mon coeur s'déchire quand j'dit ça car j'ai trop été déçu
Mais bon puisqu'il faut vivre j'assume
Aujourd'hui j'ai une femme qui m'aime, qui m'aide
Elle me dit t'auras bientôt un p'tit frère
Et qu'elle veut faire une grande fête
Inch'Allah qu'j'te retrouve avant pour qu'tu puisses être là
Pour que tu le prenne dans tes bras et que, et que

Tu lui parles de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais, prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Dédicacé à tout ceux qui savent c'que c'est d'être loin d'son fils, loin d'sa fille
A tous ces pères enfermés
A tous ces pères divorcés
A ceux à qui on a volé le rôle de père
A tous les enfants de la DDASS",Parle-Moi
Soprano,"Passe moi le mic que je représente tous ces quartiers de France,
Toutes ces sentences, tous ceux qui subissent l'intolérance,
L'inégalité des chances,
Toute cette misère que les médias maquillent en déliquance!

Passe moi le mic que je représente ces femmes de ménage,
Ces pères au chantier, ces fils dans l'usinage,
Ces mères isolées, ces grands frères alcolisés!
En gros tous ces foyers détruits par le manque de monnaie!

Passe moi le mic que je représente les sans papiers,
Les exilés, les expulsés,
Toutes ces familles qui vivent dans l'insalubrité,
Ces familles colonisées qui voyaient la France comme un terre de liberté!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette Islam de paix,
Cette mixité entre communautés, la richesse du métissage,
Cet arc-en-ciel qui fait que la France a aujourd'hui le plus beau paysage!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette sœur avocate,
Ce frère médecin, ces frères à  la fac, ceux qui taffent au black,
Ces patrons de snacks, ceux qui touchent le smic,
Tous ces bac +8 qui squattent l'assedic!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette jeunesse qu'on empêche de rêver,
Cette jeunesse qui a besoin d'exprimer sa liberté est ses idées,
Qui a besoin de s'évader, cette jeunesse qui a besoin d'exister!

On prend le mic pour ceux qui ont pas la parole!
A la vie, à  la mort, quel est notre rôle? (On représente!)
Toi qui porte les douleurs de l'époque,
Quelle que soit ta couleur, peu importe! (On représente!)
Le poing levé mais jamais à  genoux
Vu que personne ne fait pour nous, on représente!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette Afrique endettée,
Ces français pas encore intégrés,
Cette solidarité entre peuples affamés,
Ce père tirailleur qui attend encore d'être indemnisé!

Passe moi le mic que je représente ces cousins du bled
Qui font la plonge pour envoyer de la thune,
Tous ceux qui viennent pour faire des études
Pour eux l'école c'est des ailes alors que pour nous ça reste une enclume!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette file d'attente
Devant la poste tous les 5 du mois,
Ces coups de blues qui fait que mes frères dans l'alcool se noient,
Ces victimes de bavures policières qui me font crier",Passe-Moi le Mic
Soprano,"Yeah
Puisqu'il faut vivre, autant le faire avec le sourire
Se dire que le meilleur est à venir
Que le pire permet de construire ce vraiment à quoi on aspire
Se dire pendant la chute qu'il y a toujours espoir de bien atterrir
La vie ça ne se respire qu'une seule fois
Et le bonheur ça se vit sans aucune loi
Être libre, voilà mon véritable combat
Tout faire pour que ma colombe intérieure ai enfin le cœur qui bât
Mais des fois je lâche, dans ma tête c'est le désordre
Je trouve la force que pour faire le nœud de ma corde
Comme ce fameux 3 décembre
Allah pardonne moi d'avoir voulu mettre ma vie en cendres
Un suicide c'est lâche et égoïste
Ça prend le cœur de ceux qui t'aiment vraiment et ça le trempe dans l'acide
T'as raison, Kery, pourquoi on fait du mal à ceux qu'on aime?
Aujourd'hui c'est pour eux que je vis
C'est pour vous que je rappe, à bout de forces au milieu de l’arène
Au milieu des corps de ceux qu'ont voulu abattre mes rêves
Toujours debout, les pieds levés, qu'ils viennent
Un coup d’œil dans les tribunes, car c'est dans vos regards que je trouve de l'aide
Dans vos regards que je soigne mes plaies
Celles qu'on retrouve dans chaque phase de mes couplets
Aujourd'hui je me bats pour mes véritables besoins
Car celui qui se contente de peu ne manque de rien
Moi j'oublie rien, de toutes ces galères, ni d'où je viens
Moi j'oublie rien, mes potes savent que je reviens de loin
Je suis originaire d'un port d'esclaves
J'ai la peau couleur pétrole et ça les colons le savent
Je suis Comorien et je suis fier de l'être, porter ce sang est un honneur
Moi j'ai pas le droit à l'erreur, car les miens ont droit à l'or
Pour l'amour de cette femme, qui porte mon alliance et mon gosse
Je me dois d'être fort, yeah, yeah, yeah
Deviens ma camisole, et me laisse plus dormir seul
Je porte la solitude, comme un homme porte un linceul
Prendre de l'altitude m'a toujours donné le mal de l'air
Plus je monte, plus j'ai besoin d'une couette dans cette ambiance polaire
Ma colère envers les hommes est énorme
Comme tu vois, le monde est toujours aussi stone
Regarde, Sheitan a beaucoup plus de Stan
Et certains chants des stades me rappellent l'Amistade
A l'heure où les roses sont offerts aux morts plus qu'aux vivants
A l'heure où on est plus pris par le temps que par le vent
A l'heure où les médias font de la lessive avec notre cerveau
A l'heure où les bergers font de la laine sur notre dos
On se doit d'être forts, se battre contre l'injustice
Mais surtout se battre contre nos putains de caprices
Pour changer le monde, faut changer ses désirs
Puisqu'il faut vivre, faut qu'on résiste

Viva la révolution (yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (yeah, viva la révolution, yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (viva! viva! yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (viva la révolution)
Pour toutes nos générations (puisqu'il faut vivre, autant le faire avec le sourire)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, se dire que le meilleur est à venir, yeah, yeah)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, puisqu'il faut vivre faut se battre faut qu'on résiste)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, pour un meilleur avenir, yeah)

Puisqu'il faut vivre, yeah
Merci à tous ceux qui me suivent depuis le début
A ceux qui suivent psychiatre, yeah
A.L.O.N, Vinz, Sya, yeah
Puisqu'il faut vivre, autant le faire avec le sourire
Pour un meilleur avenir

Sopra M'Baba, yeah",Puisqu'il Faut Vivre
Soprano,"Je n'ai appris qu'à perdre, qu'à mettre les mains dans la merde 
Qu'à n'être rien dans ma tête, qu'à faire la guerre qu'à mes frères 
Qu'à voir ma mère dans les dettes, qu'ils aillent se faire mettre, mec, t’inquiètes 
Le petit nègre sera riche avant qu'on l'enterre 
Je n'ai qu'un seul maître, qu'un seul modèle, pour être loin de votre matériel 
Et prêt de l'amour maternel, moi ma guerre à l'heure où on te parle qu'en modem, 
C'est niquer le système où on t'apprend à vivre au singulier mais plus au pluriel 
Plus rien sur terre m'attire, on s'écoute que quand ça tire 
La colombe ici s'enterre et les corbeaux s'en tirent 
La paix est une cause militaire qui sauve des vies pétrolières 
Car je ne vois tomber que des missiles de leur canadair 
Entre crises alimentaires et bavures policières 
Normal qu'avec tous ces poulets, les blocks aient la grippe aviaire 
Je déteste Marine comme Diam's mais encore pire son père 
Car je suis Tookie Williams et lui Schwarzenegger 
Aujourd'hui ils nous parlent tous des bienfaits des colonies 
Dès qu'on leur dit qu'on est français, ils nous disent d'arrêter nos calomnies 
Ils nous ont mis loin de leur économie
Et puis s'étonnent que nos petits ne veulent que le RMI 
He ouais l'ami, je rappe comme un coup de gun venu de ces coups de gueule 
Où les paliers sont des plateaux télé de Jerry Springer 
Un rap qui vient du cœur, un rap de prolétaire, 
Dis toi que pour eux je serai au rap ce que Bruel est au pocker 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Je rappe la noiceur de mon épiderme 
La famine d'un frigidaire 
Le silence d'un solitaire 
La lame d'un suicidaire 
L'histoire changée au cutter 
Les larmes d'un jugé à tort 
Celles de nos miradors 
La sueur de mes disques d'or 
La poésie du mesquine 
La poésie du Uzi 
La poésie de Mesrine 
La poésie anti skin 
Les dés pipés de l’État 
La fin des temps et ses signes 
L'état des frères m'guettah 
Nos pères tués à l'usine 
L'énorme manque de caille 
L'énorme manque de médailles 
La marque sur le dos du bétail 
La sincérité de Chiens de Paille

Tu veux savoir, dans l'idéal, mec, je rappe la persévérance 
Partage mes errances, en gras, marque ma différence. 
Je rappe par déférence. Hommage à mes référents. 
Capte, Mormeck, frappe dans le sac, moi dans la page blanche. 
Je rappe au nom des miens. Pas le droit que dans le son y'ait rien 
Mate dans mes calepins, c'est plein de Blap-Blap, je descends les chiens 
Au mic, défends les miens. Clap-clap quand je me sens bien 
Je te mets à l'aise, c'est juste du rap. Je nargue comme Hugo Chavez. 
Oh! L'humour est noir car l'humeur du Métèque est mate. 
Chill, c'est à toi, place l'échec et mat. 

On donne grâce et courage, la France rage et nous brade 
Les flics sur le terrain frappent, et les gradés nous parlent 
Bordel, on est des hommes, y'en a marre de jouer les coupables 
Y'a beau mettre les formes mais ces cons nous passent des dourags 
Qu'on se nomme Brad ou Mourad, le passé nous parle 
On tire la paix hors de la guerre, en étudiant les vers et Sourates 
Avec le plastic, le C4, ces cavés nous casent 
Trop de pression dans ce bled et nos fesses jouent les soupapes 
Si je voulais manipuler l'or, je serais député ou pape 
Qu'ils soient dégoûtes ou pas, ma vie est vouée au rap 
Rimes en XTRA large en déboutant les coulées pou-raves 
Assis comme un bouddha, écoute moi livrer des bouts d'âme 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto

J'prend le large à chaque fois

Que j'arrête de chercher des portes de secours dans des impasses
D'ici faut que je me casse 
Vite faite moi la passe 
Que je mette une boule à face' toute

Ouvrez-nous la porte

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Nous sommes des milliers
A vouloir comme vous
Venir sans rendez-vous
Nous voulons voyager
Et aussi travailler
Mais nous, on vous a pas

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Nous aussi on veut connaître la chance d'étudier, 
La chance de voir nos rêves se réaliser, 
Avoir un beau métier, pouvoir voyager, 
Connaître ce que vous appelez liberté. 

On veut que nos familles ne manquent plus de rien, 
On veut avoir cette vie où l'on mange à sa faim, 
On veut quitter cette misère quotidienne pour de bon, 
On veut partir d'ici car nous sommes tous en train de péter les plombs !

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

De prendre son envol

Ouvrez la porte, ici, la jeunesse s'essouffle,

Et leur sable doré
Mis l’animal en cage
Et battu nos forêts

On se prépare au voyage
Et on se jette dans le vide

Femme de ménage ca ne suffit pas pour remplir les assiettes

Mon rap a une colombe à l'épaule droite, un corbeaux à l'épaule gauche
Un drapeau blanc à la main droite et une kalash à la main gauche
Il écrit au bord des larmes quand il voit l'état du monde
Il écrit au bord des flammes en espérant que la pluie tombe
Il fait des pompes, pour porter les fardeaux de sa jeunesse
Il décrit le stress, des frères, qui n'ont qu'la violence comme S.O.S
Il écrit avec tout l'encre de ses yeux
Il bat de ses ailes en haut d'un bloc pour essayer d'éteindre le feu
Il croit en Dieu, sa philosophie est dans l'dîne, aucune vulgarité, pour ne pas salir l'image muslim
Boulimie d'sincérité à chaque fois qu'il pose ses rimes
Anorexie de vanité même, même quand il fait platine
Il a une flamme olympique à la place de la rétine
Il fait de l'égotrip avec le langage d'une chevrotine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok, encore

Mon rap a les racines d'Afrique, le tronc de France, les branches des quartiers
Des feuilles pour écrire c'que la jeunesse pense
Ses fruits sont dans les bacs pour les affamés de gros son
Il n'a pas poussé dans un parc mais dans une forêt de béton
Il est parfois un saule pleureur ou parfois un chêne
Pour le déraciner dites aux bûcherons qu'ils peuvent ranger leurs chèques
Il préfère arroser les deux banzaï de son jardin
Il aime le naturel, il laisse les guirlandes aux sapins
Il prétend pas être le meilleur des hommes, comme tout le monde
Il essaye de remettre son auréole à chaque fois qu'elle tombe
Toujours le même après la thérapie de son album
Il se bat pour le confort de sa famille et de sa tombe
Il a connu la gloire et ses revers
Les ""je t'aime"" et les repose en guerre
Le bras bouffé par ceux a qui il a tendu la main
Le cœur bouffé à chaque fois qu'il a déçu les siens
Comprend le bien, il est pas là pour faire la star ni le comédien
Le cerveau plein, il rap avec les tripes ses problèmes du quotidien
Frérot, il est venu faire son boulot avec une colombe dans la plume et un corbeau dans l'flow
Lui demande pas d'rapper c'que tu penses, s'il n'le pense pas
De faire du rap que t'aimes, s'il n'aime pas
De rapper tes idées, yeah, s'il les combat

Je t'ai vu porter mes nuits pour soigner mes insomnies
J't'ai vu porter mon alliance
Pour le meilleur et pour le pire
Me faire des révérences pour me montrer mon empire
Je t'ai vu fermer les yeux quand j'te faisais souffrir
Demander à Dieu de pouvoir me nourrir
Je t'ai vu porter neuf mois, ce qu'on n'trouve pas au paradis
Je t’ai vu dans mes bras, toi, le vrai sens de ma vie
Je t'ai vu cacher tes larmes pour me voir sourire
Décharger mon arme pour m'empêcher de mourir
Vous m'enlevez ces larmes beaucoup trop près de mes veines
Vous, les clefs de mes chaînes
Moi, je voulais vous dire

Si le soleil ne te souris plus et que la vie ne t'offre que la pluie
Je serai là, je serai là
Si les éclairs te font trembler
Et que la nuit tu n'trouves pas la paix
Je serais là, je serais là

Bien sûr, je sais pertinemment que je pourrai jamais
Rembourser tous les pansements que t'as collé sur mes plaies
Ni effacer toutes les fois où j'ai levé la voix sur toi
Ni oublier toutes ces fois où t'as noyé tes joues pour moi
Tu verras j'ferai du feu pour que tes hivers soient moins dur
J'aurai tes cernes sous mes yeux pour payer toutes tes factures
Y aura du ciment sur mes mains pour bâtir ton avenir
Y aura du sang sur mes mains si un homme te fait souffrir
J'te jure, t'auras la lune à tes pieds si tu me le demandes
Si tu veux une grosse fortune j'aurai une cagoule dans une banque
Si la chance te manque j'irai fouiller le ciel pour t'offrir une étoile filante
Pour toi l'impossible je le fais
Toi mon plus beau trophée
Même si je dois voler le soleil pour t'réchauffer
L'impossible je le fais, pour toi ma vrai fée
T'as toujours été là pour me sauver

Si, si le soleil ne te souris plus et que la vie ne t'offre que la pluie

Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Depuis qu'tu nous a quitté, toutes les nuits on vit les yeux ouverts
Depuis qu'tu nous a laissés, tous les jours on attend une petite lettre
L'océan la peut-être mangé, ils savent peut-être pas nager
Le coeur nous a lâché, quand son petit frère est venu nous dire :

Papa je quitte la maison, là-bas les hommes utilisent leurs ailes
Mama je quitte la maison, ne pleure pas ton fils va vivre ses rêves

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Maman j'suis de retour, là-bas j'croyais faire mon envol
Après l'école j'taffais au black, non l'argent n'pousse pas sur le sol
Y'a qu'au football là-bas qu'on n'regarde pas la couleur de peau
Au pays d'la liberté, y'a un berger et un troupeau
J'ai vu aussi mon grand frère, il vit avec Moussa loin d'la Tour Eiffel
Ils on stoppé la fac de lettre pour remplir l'assiette
Loin du soleil africain, tous les matins sur le marché
Les larmes aux yeux il se souvient quand vous lui disiez

Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, là-bas les hommes oublient l'essentiel
Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, ne crois pas que tout est mieux là-bas

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Ne nous quitte pas on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas on a besoin de toi",On a Besoin de Toi
Soprano,"Yeah, plus le temps de regarder le rétro
Non plus le temps d'attendre sur le quai de la vie un métro
Non plus le temps de croire aux promesses de politiciens
Faut des Ray Ban et des mannequins pour finir à l'Élysée
Non plus le temps de regarder défiler les saisons
Ni d'attendre que Jean-Pierre te fasse gagner des millions
Non plus le temps de croire qu'on vit encore chez Mickey Mouse
Alors qu'on a tous dans le métro la gueule du Dr. House ou d'Amy Wihnouse
Parceque la vie est trop speed
Parce qu'il faut aller remplir la marmite
Pourquoi tu penses que les gens fument la weed?
Car personne n'a la cape de Christopher Reeve

Stop, mec il est temps de quitter le ghetto
Mec il est temps d'avoir le salaire de Samuel Eto'o
Mec il est temps d'se barrer pour aller voir du pays
De frotter nos porte-feuilles pour qu'il y sorte un génie
Mec il est temps qu'la daronne se fasse appeler ""mamie""
Il est temps qu'on aille faire nos courses en Lamborghini
Mec il est temps qu'on aille enfin profiter de la vie
Avant qu'la mort nous passe la bague au doigt sans qu'on lui dise oui
Poto si si en même temps que la vie se décide
Donne-toi les moyens pour devenir invincible
Cours récupérer ce que tu as pour cible
Car personne au monde ne peut te l'interdire

L'arrivée est trop classe
J'me pose comme un cheveu dans la soupe
Attiré par les phrases les phrasés et les phases qui sortent d'ma bouche
On m'dit 'rétrograde' donc j'roule en 6ème pendant la course
Et du coup beaucoup d'entre vous tous sont à bout d'souffle, tous étouffés
Regardes mon rap étoffer, est trop frais
T'effarais la chronique et dopé
Autant péta un pote et planter et d’applaudir donc okay
Mes rimes j’aiguise et vite je vise brise le biz
Loin de ces Mc's qui s'déguisent, qui médisent et qui s'méprisent
J'suis venu oser, tozer, causer, poser, composer, innover
Faire des lovés sans être mauvais
Bosser proposer du progrès dans mes projets les plus chauds
Et ceux qui s'moquaient, qui boycottaient, qui complotaient dans mon dos
Et voulaient m'stopper ou me bloquer car j'suis doté d'un flow opé
Beaucoup trop frais, pour les kho et pour les potos j'vise le trophée
Carpe Diem c'est du sérieux, selon l'humeur, y'a d'l'humour, t'inquiètes
Même quand c'est prit à la légère, c'est du lourd (Let's Go)

Que les rappeurs déposent le bilan, j'suis de retour dans les affaires
Avec dans les veines toujours le même sang raconté par Stéphane Bern
Pas le même que Ségolène mais le même que celui de l'aigle
Un peu d'papier pour les Geneviève comme les photos d'Valérie Bègue
Évites de croire qu'j'étais comme Bruce Willis dans '6ème Sens
Alors que j'étais comme Benzema, bien loin, dans l'équipe de France
Je vend de la poudre blanche pour les nasos des MP3
Ou tu peux me voir dans les veines de ceux qui veulent gagner le Tour de France
Je remplis les morgues et les ambulances de MC's sans compétences
Je les mets en chien tellement Brigitte Bardot m'accuse de maltraitance
Y'aura des turbulences à la sortie de mon disque
Je serai Valérie Damidot pour cette industrie du disque
Un flow qui casse le crâne comme une bouteille d'Urban Peace
(Ceux qui goûtent tellement d’Mc’s qui les détester à Green Peace?)

Mon rap chante que les bobos provoquent de beaux bobards
Zappe la prod' et les potos savent que les propos font trop mal
La voir regarder les bobos dans les blocks dans la foule ou dans les bacs
On a que des bacs dans les locaux avec des têtes de bosniaques
Avec une technique on pose grave qui peut que te plaire et te faire taire
Des rafales de phases que rêvent d'avoir les plus gros chefs militaires
Des tonnes de vagues t’inquiète mon rap en aura bien des plus belles
Des phases qui gardent les pieds sur terres pour éviter les plus belles chutes
Avoues qu'c'est débile
Dis moi comment donner naissance à ton succès si ton disque est stérile?
J’entends souvent dans tes couplets qu't'as tout tué
Mais MC ne confond pas Hiroshima et ton 14 Juillet
Vas y, mènes les tous à l'abattoir
J'suis pas encore sur les ondes mais sur les playlists des radiotrottoir

Sur internet les pédophiles vont à la pêche avec des ""lol""
Le monde est stone poto, faut travailler plus pour gagner plus
Puis on finit heureux comme les employés de France Telecom
Oui on déconne avec l'écologie, faut réagir
Notre confort technologique a assassiné Haiti
Les colonies en 2010
Et j'te parle pas de la Palestine
Combien de pays démocratiques emploient des présidents d'Afrique l'ami!
Le taux de suicide n'inquiète personne à l'Elysée
Préfère parler de la burqa que d'la violence dans les lycées
Quand j'regarde les chaînes télévisées et leurs émissions à la con
J'me dis que Marc Dorcel sera bientôt notre ministre de l'éducation
À la maison les parents craquent et investissent au Loto
Car ce qui coûtait hier 5 francs coûte aujourd'hui 5 euros
Pour être heureux ça prend des anti-dépresseurs
Ou d'autres comme moi prennent l'ascenceur
Pour aller

Sur la Lune, sur la Lune
Les problèmes du monde me paraissent petits quand je les vois depuis la Lune
Sur la Lune, tous mes rêves flottent, je balaye la poussière d'étoile avec ma plume
Sur la Lune je marcherais, un petit pas pour l'Homme, un grand pas pour ma liberté
Sur la Lune, sur la Lune, sur ma Lune

J'ai le mal de Terre depuis gamin, un besoin aérien
Car dans le cœur des Hommes la température a sorti les sapins
Donne moi les clefs de ma cellule, que j'vois à quoi me servent mes ailes
Ma vie a beau prendre la pilule, mais elle n'accouche que des problèmes
Bien sur je l'aime ma vie des blocks, mais à la manière de Kurt Cobain
Avec un fusil dans la gorge et de l'amertume dans mes poèmes
Oui mec je traîne toutes les séquelles d'une jeunesse prit à la gorge
Car ici quand t'as la dalle, tu finis par bouffer ton auréole
Ici on te juge à ta couleur ou ton adresse
Donc t'as mis la cagoule pour que t'évites le délit de faciès
Oui ça fait la sieste au fond de la classe car encore une fois
Papa et Maman ont passé la nuit à se taper et à boire
Entre les guerres de religion et l'extrême consommation
Dans cette société qui joue à guichet fermé dans les prisons
Pour ne pas perdre la raison, j'préfère vivre dans ma fiction
La tête dans les nuages pour aller voir des étoiles par millions

Sur la Lune, sur la Lune
Les problèmes du monde me paraissent petits quand je les vois depuis la Lune
Sur la Lune, tous mes rêves flottent, je balaye la poussière d'étoile avec ma plume
Sur la Lune je marcherais, un petit pas pour l'Homme, un grand pas pour ma liberté

Soprano,"Je n'ai pas eu la vie de Ricky, pas de lit en Ferrari
Mais plutôt des lits superposés cassés dans la nuit
Je suis de ces petits qu'ont grandi avec Michael Jackson
Et l'esprit pervers de Niki Larson
À l'école j'étais un Bart Simpson
Bob Marley dans le casque, on planait sur Kingston
Nos grands frères vivaient comme Tanguy
Et nos darons sur fauteuil se prenaient pour Al Bundy
Dans les poches c'était le Sahara
La daronne rentrait du taff avec les larmes de princesse Sarah
Mes potes s'arrachent, les neurones fument
Et ont la tête plus grosse que dans le Collège Fou-Fou-Fou
Nos sœurs sont belles qu'elles aient ou pas le foulard
Si tu les cherches, elles deviennent des Myriam Lamare
Moi, assis sur un banc, la tête dans les nuages, attend
Qu'il m'arrive quelque chose de grand

La tête dans les nuages, comme toi j'attends
Qu'il m'arrive enfin quelque chose de grand, yeah, yeah

Mais j'ai appris à être patient
Car je sais que Dieu est grand

Chez moi on grandit comme Luke pour finir comme Anakin
Ya ceux qu'investissent dans le look, ceux qui vendent de la résine
Moi j'ai choisi la musique, celle de l'oncle Sam
Pour avoir de la chance, toucher le mic comme toucher les armes
J'ai vécu dans la cabine de Phone Game
Avec au bout du fil, les couplets d'Iam et d'N.T.M
J'ai laissé mon A.D.N sur tout les micros
Mais c'est pas toujours avec les as qu'on remporte le full
Donc j'ai taffé mes textes, mon univers
Pour que ma musique rassemble plus de monde que Zuckerberg
Hein, tu sais pour rapper
Faut connaître la pointure de sa vie pour trouver chaussure à son pied
Donc j'écris mes textes sans faire le Mesrine
On m'a prédit l'échec, aujourd'hui je les signe
C'est vrai que j'ai quitté le banc
Mais toujours la tête dans les nuages en attendant quelque chose de grand

Assis sur un banc comme bien souvent

Je n'ai mendié aucune couronne au rap français
Je n'écoute pas son discours mais celui du mec debout sur un minaret
On m'a appelé Soprano par rapport à l'appel à la prière
Pas par rapport à Tony du New Jersey
J'ai pas changé
Tu peux me croiser le vendredi le front posé sur la chaussée de ton quartier
Bien sûr que je traîne moins au quartier
À l'âge que j'ai, ma fille me veut au près d'elle ou en train d'enregistrer
Ils n'ont jamais demander d'avoir un père célèbre
Donc je fais tous pour être présent pour ses petits zèbres
C'est fou comme les choses changent
Avant je jouais ma vie sur des notes noires, aujourd'hui sur des blanches
Je t'avoues des fois le succès ça me rend fêlé
Je veux pas me plaindre c'est la vie dont je rêvait
Moi le mélancolique, avec le temps
Je prends conscience de vivre quelque chose de grand

Quitter ce goût de goudron qu'on a tous dans la bouche
Tellement de promesses à tenir, de choses à accomplir
Besoin d'emmagasiner de magnifiques souvenirs
Mais dis-moi qui au monde sait quand je partirai

Vas coucher ta petite Dora, je fais la magie noire de Poudlard
Ne m'appelles pas Nakamura, ce soir appelle moi Sylar
Mon rap te lâche des mollards, ouais tout droit venu de Massilia
Transforme ton rap Godzilla en petite Chantale Goya
Appelle moi S.A.W, je suis venu défoncer la prod
Dis-toi que je serai le dernier à brandir l'épée de MacLeod
Oui mon rap est tellement sauvage que tes dents me serviront de bling-bling
Il te fera tellement de dommages que tu finiras comme dans Shining
Je suis le Thriller de Jackson, voilà mec pourquoi t’as la trouille
Demandes à mon poto Jason, ta tête servira de citrouille

Ils se déguisent pour des bonbons, t'imagines?
Halloween
Bientôt ils prendront tous de la codéine

A-L-O-N-Z-O, membre de la Psykatra papé, que Dieu nous garde

Que des bitchs, que des bitchs, balance l'instru que j’les gifle
Arraché de couronne à l'agression à Miami Beach
Ils se déguisent tous pour des chips, on les switch, on les switch
J'ai les démons qui m'aguichent, j'ouvre le game au pied de biche
Fuck you, 2011 si tu es là tire moi dessus
J'perds pas la guerre, j'ai trop le mort, j’suis dans les airs à bout de nerfs
En bord de mer c'est le ghetto
Dans la tête c'est le ghetto
Partenaire nos adversaires ils périront tous façon ghetto
Dans le trou, j'transforme les leaders en Lidl sur le coup
J'suis campeón et j'ai pris gout, je me sens grand comme José Mou
Mais mêle mêle mêle toi de ce qui te regarde petit pédé
Je suis Broly petit pédé
Sors ton brolik petit pédé
Dans l'estime ou dans la guigne, la Zubrowsa dans la boca
La bo loca, A-L-O-N, braquage vocal Ratatata
M'oblige pas à faire marche arrière sur toi
J'ai pété les rétros, les feux arrières donc tu ne me vois pas plus haut

Je me sens comme un Irakien devant la tombe à George Bush
Certains fument de la kush ou ne parlent que de cash
D'autres font les mielleux pour ramener une abeille dans leur ruche
Un poker pour être riche, un poker pour la triche
Ça mise comme un pit' ça repart comme un caniche
Lunettes sur le nez, on se prend pour Gilbert Montagné
Passe-moi le micro car je suis Jordan face au panier
Cocotiers et palmiers, on en rêve toute l'année
Donc ça passe l'été au bled, pour pouvoir mieux cramer
La petite est charmée, je lui dis que je suis marié
Je lui présente Habid il veut que tu sois sa kiné
Merde y'a les condés, ils nous rendent tous malades
Ils veulent nous cuisiner, on leur donne des salades
Il est 6h du mat' les khos il faut que je m'arrache

Des bords qui nous guettent, des bords dans la hass
Elles l'ont vu dans la presse, elles veulent Dj Mej
Hardcore dés le petit dej', que personne ne l'approche
Pourquoi tu fais la fraiche? Alors que t'es moche
On parle des derniers sons, dernier Lil' Wayne, dernier Jay-Z

Soprano,"Yeah , DJ Mej
Effrite ce que tu veux
Ce soir je vais leur parler de De mon One Love , Kamarade!
C'est le corbeau
Je me rappelle la première fois que je l'ai rencontré
Elle était dans les bras d'un certain Jackson
Elle faisait danser des zombies et allumait le sol
C'était l'époque où sur les ondes y'avait que son côté rock
Moi dans ma chambre je passai mon temps à danser le moonwalk
Chez moi on se prennait pour les Jackson Five
Pour moi elle etait pas d'ici comme E.T. et Alf
Sous le charme de son côté Black Américain
Encore plus quand j'ai vu le côté Jamaïcain
Je la voyais pleurer dans les bras d'un certain Bob
Elle était rasta et ne chantait que le Love
Elle parlait du monde, elle parlait des pauvres
Ses messages ont donnés naissance à ma colombe
Elle faisait de la poésie dans l'hexagone
Jean-Jacques Golman disait d'elle, Qu'elle était bonne
On disait aussi qu'elle adoucissait les moeurs
J'ai pris une feuille en esperant avoir, mon premier flirt
Je me suis promis qu'un jour je lui ferais des gosses
Promesse tenue, Quand j'ai rencontré son côté Hip-Hop

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love
Celle qui s'impose à moi
One, one love

Mon Hip-Hop, mon royaume, mon home sweet home
Il falait m'interner après les freestyle de Time Bomb
A cause de deux petits, je mettais mes baggys à l'envers
Grâce à deux grands je n'avais plus peur de crier ""N*que Ta Mère""
Là où je vis les métèques et Mat squattent le banc
Où sont diplômés à l'école du micro d'argent
On traînait à trente comme le Wu de ODB
On rêvait Queens grâce à C.N.N &. M.O.B.B
On croyait que Lacoste était riche grâce à Lino
On était tous les enfants seuls de Puccino
Une pensée poour 2Pac et Biggie
Le débit de mon Corbeau c'est du Bone Thugs-N-Garmony
J'avais la furie et la foi de la F.F
J'étais Mafia K'1 Fry quand Kary parlait de L.A.S
Grâce à Dre j'ai découvert snoop et Slim shady
J'étais fou quand Nas à rejoint la scène Jay-Z
J'ai des frissons quand je te parle de cette époque
Sens-tu mon coeur qui bat quand je te parle de Hip-Hop hein!

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love
Celle qui s'impose à moi
One, one love

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love
Celle qui s'impose à moi
One, one love",One Love
Soprano,"Ne mets pas un pied dans mes marécages, j’ai la mâchoire d’un piranha
Compare pas mes eaux troubles avec la piscine de Loana
Sauf si tu m’appelles Edward, pas Mathieu
Mon train pour la gloire, a quitté la gare, donc adieu
C’est le feu
Je ne compte plus les hectares de rappeurs qu’ont bronzé sous mon chalumeau
Leurs flow ont besoin de Valérie Damidot
Leurs femmes écoutent mes sons pour soigner leurs libido
Quand j’te mets au parfum ça sent le bloc, pas du Fido Dido
Baisse le rideau, bidon oui lâche le guidon
Le rap c’est Jardiland quand j’enchaîne les râteaux
Mytho arrête de parler derrière mon dos
Et colle-moi un patch anti-MC avant qu’on m’enterre sous les mégots
Oui je sais c’est trop, mais-mais pourquoi tu triches?
Remonte ton baggy mec on voit ton string
Mon rap c’est Hiroshima, viens voir un d’mes concerts et t’entendra

Et boom tout le monde lève les bras, c’est le retour de Sopram’baba
Pour mes piranhas
Où sont mes chiens d'la casse, mes spartiates de Massilia?
Chez les piranhas
Marseille où vous êtes? Tous les quartiers qui vous êtes?
Que des piranhas
De là je ne vous entends pas, la la la la la la la

Depuis que Pac m'a passé les clés beaucoup de choses ont changé
J’ai vu la Swija rentrer en tongs dans des boîtes branchées
J’ai vu des fachos fâchés, le top hip-hop saccagé
La variété amochée, les grosses pointures déchaussées
Des tas d’oreilles arrachées, les ongles des MC rongés
Toute ma sueur remboursée, ma mère moins fauchée
J’ai vu le disque en danger, la bourse du monde menacée
Un noir au pouvoir et Oussama toujours caché
La chute du pouvoir d’achat, des CDI délogés
Des CRS à la charge, des étudiants enragés
Des pistons dans les CV, des fils de riches embauchés
Blanche-Neige vend des CD, son nain gouverne l’Élysée
Le proche orient enflammé, l’Afrique toujours affamée
Et nous, on fait la manche avec des Rolex au poignet
Arrête de me jalouser
Eh t’es tellement en bois que pour avoir de la chance tu devrais te toucher

Et boom tout le monde lève les bras, c’est le retour de Sopram’baba
Pour mes piranhas
Où sont mes chiens d'la casse, mes spartiates de Massilia?
Chez les piranhas
Marseille où vous êtes? Tous les quartiers qui vous êtes?
Que des piranhas
De là je ne vous entends pas, la la la la la la la

On m'a dit mort après le feat avec Monsieur Eva Longoria
On m’a dit ""t'as changé ta SACEM à trop braquer Ikea""
On m’a dit ""c’est la crise, comment tu fais dans cette guerrilla?""
Mes vibrations sont celle de Katrina, pas celles d’un Nokia
Dès qu'y'a, des piranhas, Sompram’baba flow Cadillac
Dans les rues de Massilia, pour moi fais la Fatiha, pas la Fatouha
Anguailla la razia d’Alonzo, Vinz', Sopra' et Sya de la Psykatra
Pas de maquillage quand on lâche nos chimiques chimia
Chez nous y'a que des Mia, que des bouillants que des débrouillards
Envois les milliards que je montre comment faire une déria
Comoria mon fusil à pompe contre les barillas
Laisse-moi lâcher la bombe et crier ""Alléluia""
Moi j’oublie pas d’où je viens ni d’où je pars
M’en voulez pas si j’ai la dalle
J’ai grandi dans les débarras qu'oublie l'État
Voilà pourquoi je lâche un flow de cinglé
Prends mon retour comme un combat entre Tyson et Cassius Clay

Et boom tout le monde lève les bras, c’est le retour de Sopram’baba
Pour mes piranhas
Où sont mes chiens d'la casse, mes spartiates de Massilia?

Regarde-moi, je suis la France d'en bas
Le chômage et la crise

J'ai grandi loin des milieux aisés
Avec des parents qui ne parlaient pas un mot français
Des problèmes financiers
Obligé le daron à rentrer du chantier avec le dos cassé
Pour être sûr de ne plus croiser les huissiers
Pour pouvoir les aider, j'ai taffé au lycée
Car on m'a toujours dit que les diplômes ramenaient un métier
J'ai passé mes soirées à bosser d'arrache-pied
Jusqu'au jour où je réussis mes examens avec succès
La fierté de la famille
J'étais la lueur d'espoir
Pour enfin leur faire quitter la cité
Mais malgré mon CV, toutes les portes se fermaient
Ils disaient trop qualifié, moi je dirais trop balzané
Je me suis mis à bosser, agent de sécurité
C'était provisoire pour assurer l'arrivé du bébé
Mais les années passaient, les factures entassaient
Je suis rentré dans une banque cagoulé et j'ai crié

Regarde-moi, je suis la France d'en bas
Le chômage et la crise
Mais que c'est moi la combat?
Je vis au quotidien
Ce que tu ne connais pas, que tu ne comprends pas

J'ai grandi loin des milieux aisés
Complètement français, de parents divorcés
A cause d'un père au penchant alcoolisé
J'ai dû stopper les études pour mieux aider la mama
A payer les couches de Johanna
Ma petite sœur à moi, mon bijou, mon karma,
Celle qui me redonne le sourire quand ça va mal
Je la voyais déjà médecin ou avocat
Mais le destin a fait pour ma sœur un autre choix
A 16 ans un bébé, un loyer à payer,
Le père qui s'est barré de peur d'assumer
Des dettes plein le cerveau toujours pas de boulot
Pour payer le lait, les couches de ce petit marmot
Elle se met à tiser pour pouvoir oublier
Le neurone explosé à force de fumer
Un soir de juillet le ventre plein de cachet
Sur le répondeur des pompiers elle se met a crier

Regarde-moi, je suis la France d'en bas
Le chômage et la crise
Mais que c'est moi la combat?
Je vis au quotidien
Ce que tu ne connais pas, que tu ne comprends pas

Moi j'ai grandi dans un milieu aisé
Famille embourgeoisée
Je suis l'héritier d'une famille richissime dans le 16ème
Délégué dans une école privée, diplômé, sans forcer
Grâce au don annuel de mon Padre
Toujours bien sappé, Dior, Armanio, ou bien Dolce
Je fais le tour du monde en jet privé
Je fais sauter mes P.V car je déjeune à l'Élysée
Je passe mes soirées au cost, les narines enfarinées
Collectionne les nanas
Les belles Rihanna
Célibataire ravi
Je l'avais dit à Johanna
Mais elle m'a ramené un tout petit bébé
M'a dit qu'il était de moi et qu'il fallait l'assumer
Bien sûr je l'ai quittée
Et sans me retourner
Mais ce soir là elle m'appelle le ventre plein de cachet
Pour la calmer je suis parti voir mon banquier
Un gars cagoulé est rentré, m'a braqué puis a crié

Regarde-moi, je suis la France d'en bas
Le chômage et la crise
Mais que c'est moi la combat?

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Hello pour certains l'espoir de te voir diminue,
Fais nous au moins un signe, dis nous que t'es là.
Hello yo hello
Je sais bien que d'autres enfants te réclament aussi
Mais ce soir l'ennemi est devant le village, hello

J'entends crier à l'aide, des obus déchirent le ciel,
Je vois des corps tombés autour de moi (De moi).
Des flammes tapent à la fenêtre, ça découpe à la machette, réponds-moi.
On a besoin de toi (De toi, de toi, de toi).

Hello, si tu me cherches j'suis assis au fond du placard,
Papa et Maman m'ont dit d'aller me cacher.

Moi je ne vois que des loups
Oh ouh oh ouh oh,

Yeah, on m'a parlé de toi, on m'a dit des tas hé
Des tas d'choses, parait que tu luttais, défendais
Des tas d'causes et puis que tu pourchassais
Les badboys, gosses, de la rue ou mes cages, hé
Les sales gosses qui ne pensaient qu'à palper
En mode black ops tous équipés pour charcler
Atroce est la vie dans les quartiers
Surtout quand la mort à la porte, elle tapait
C'est hardcore, ici tout est bâclé
Tu n'as plus la cote du tout, j'suis navré
Moi qui croyais que tu traquais
Les Madoff et les Adolf
Et puis tous les apartheids
Dans la course t'es largué
Plus rien ne sert de courir
Regarde ils le savent, il le sentent
C'est fou même au parquet
On ne voit que des sourires coupables avec des larmes innocentes
Réalise qu'ils ont cloué ton clapet
Par peur que tu ne les pénalise
Ces fous veulent t'écarter
Parce que tu fais la diff' entre le flou et la clarté
Cette époque se nourrit d'abus
Et puis ton absence nous porte préjudice

Yeah, faudrait qu'on m'explique
Je ne comprends pas
On porte les riches
Et les pauvres en bavent
On m'a dit les hommes naissent libre
Et égaux en droit
J'réponds yes oui
Tout dépend l'endroit
Trop d'acteur, beaucoup de bandits
Qui se jouent du droit et se font passer pour des victimes
Le braqueur de la boulangerie
Pointe du doigt le voleur de pain au chocolat fictif
C'est fou ce que la vie enseigne
Inégalité entre la petite délinquance et puis les grands députés
On est pas tous logés à la même enseigne
Mais sur le même pied d'égalité amputé
Pas de limite et puis pas de pitié
C'est la loi du plus fort
Mort est celui qui mord à l'appât
On le voit dans les hall, les couloirs
C'est évident, ma foi
L'homme au pouvoir est un loup pour l'homme qui n'en a pas
Ils sont tous omnibulés par tous leurs dollars
Au lieu de voir l'individu par la couleur de l'âme
Ou la couleur des larmes
Celles qui quand sonne le drame
Témoignent de la douleur de l'homme
Cette époque se nourrit d'abus
Et puis ton absence nous porte préjudice

Soprano,"C'est aujourd'hui en rentrant dans ta chambre
Que j'ai compris que t'étais vraiment plus là
Tu sais, j'ai toujours cru que j'allais enterrer mes parents
Mais jamais mon enfant, jamais (jamais, jamais, jamais)

Encore une étoile qui vient de s'éteindre
La nuit devient de plus en plus sombre
Comment consoler cette mère
Qui sait ce soir ce qu'est la fin du monde
On enterre ses parents mais pas ses enfants
C'est ce qu'elle m'a dit en pleurant dans mes bras
Ici c'est la Saint Valentin
Les kalash ont encore offert des roses
Au pied d'une tombe, une rose arrosée
Dans les larmes d'une mère victime d'un cœur dévalisé
S-O-S-O-S, S-O-S-O-S-O-S
Combien de fils faut-il encore perdre
Pour qu'ils répondent enfin à l'appel
Faut-il que ça parte guerre civile
Ou bien pire, en génocide?
Ici les armes ne sont pas factices
Et nos p'tits anges se diabolisent
Le paradis est sous ses pieds
Pourtant on lui fait vivre l'enfer
Encore un fils qu'on enterre
Entend les cris d'une mère en détresse

Yeah, dis-moi comment vivre avec ça?
Ils ont tué mon bébé love
Ici quand les kalashs parlent
C'est pour nous offrir des roses
Kalash and roses, kalash and roses
Kal-kalash and roses, kal-kalash and roses (C'est pour nous offrir des roses)
Kalash and roses, kalash and roses
Kal-kalash and roses, kal-kalash and roses

Encore une bougie qui vient de s'éteindre
Un an déjà que tu n'es plus de ce monde
Comment consoler cette mère
Qui élève seule son môme
On enterre son père mais pas son mari
C'est c'qu'elle m'a dit en pleurant dans mes bras
Ici c'est la Saint Valentin
Les kalash ont encore offert des roses
Papa où t'es, papa où t'es?
C'est ce qu'il pleure, alcoolisé
Dans un bar du quartier
Il se promet d'aller tous les shooter
S-O-S-O-S, S-O-S-O-S-O-S
Ici la vengeance est un boomerang
Et les armes à feu la seule langue
Pour répondre à cette violence
Que le système ne peux plus masquer
Des billets dans la poche d'une balance
Il démarre en deux roues casqué
Une voiture à l'arrêt, une détente qui se presse
Encore un fils qu'on enterre
Entends une autre mère en détresse

Yeah, dis-moi comment vivre avec ça?
Ils ont tué mon bébé love
Ici quand les kalashs parlent
C'est pour nous offrir des roses
Kalash and roses, kalash and roses
Kal-kalash and roses, kal-kalash and roses (C'est pour nous offrir des roses)

Après le match on a passé deux heures à jacasser
Sur la route c'était bouché un mec s'est fracassé
Et la batterie d'mon téléphone fait le Ramadan toute l'année
À croire qu'à tes potes t'es fiancé
À quand le faire-part et le bébé?
J'vous souhaite un beau mariage
Moi, j'serai plus ta femme de ménage
Ah, tu vas pas commencer il est deux heures du mat'
Mets-moi ton carton rouge que je quitte ce match
En plus j'suis défoncé et chaque fois qu'tu parles
J'ai l'impression d'entendre Brad Pitt dans Snatch

J'vais t'envoyer recommandé
C'est comme ça tous les soirs

Ta mère croit que j'suis PDG de France Telecom?
Faut qu'je décompresse un peu bébé, j'vais au sport
Habille-toi comme une princesse à mon retour je te jure on sort
Heureusement que pour ça je n'compte pas sur toi
Ton dernier cadeau date de la préhistoire
Y en a que pour tes paires de Air Max
Moi j'veux des vacances à Djerba
Écoute, t'habites un magasin Zara
Et ta salle de bain est un rayon de Sephora
J'ai même pris des actions chez Interflora
C'est pour toi que ma CB fume plus que Wiz Khalifa
Les moments à deux je peux les compter
Obligée de te pister comme un condé
J'attends toujours notre restau' (Quoi?)

Attends, toi qu'a souvent la mémoire de Jason Bourne

Pour bâtir à mes enfants le bunker d'un régiment
Oui je rappe depuis mes 15 ans
La chanson m'a évité la prison
Une pensée pour Papou on t'attends à la maison
Les procès, les décès, la rue nous a bien baisé
Mais la vie, c'est comme le rugby, t'as le droit à plusieurs essais
Donc j’essaie même blessé par les mauvaises relations
A cause de tous ces couteaux j'ai le dos d'un hérisson
Mais t'inquiètes, j'ai grandi
Je ne suis pas de ceux qui se vengent
Mais plutôt de ceux qui croient en Dieu, trop gentil,
Trop naïf, voilà mon plus gros défaut
Mon grand cœur, une gamelle qu'a rassasié des corbeaux
Oui j'en souffre, oui j'en pleure car je suis quelqu'un d'entier
Si la richesse est dans le cœur dis toi que beaucoup m'ont ruiné
J'ai souri à la mort croyant que la vie me snobait
Dieu merci ma famille m'a prouvé que je me trompais
J'ai connu les coups de crasse, les angoisses
Mais j'espère que ça roule pour toi mais sans joint de culasse
Des kilos d'Exomil pour camoufler mes paniques
Un sourire factice pour cacher mon Titanic
J'ai rappé mes blessures, ma haine envers l'être humain
J'ai pleuré tout mon encre pour le sol africain
J'ai chanté le malaise de toute la France d'en bas
Je suis l'enfant du peuple donc tu connais mon combat
Même si j'ai fait de l'argent, j'oublie pas mes HLM
J'ai toujours été sincère, j'ai toujours été moi même
J'ai rappé pour la street avec des flow fantastiques
J'ai toujours fait le boulot et ça sur n'importe quel feet
C'était pas pour le rallye c'était pas pour la couronne
C'était pas pour être crédible car je le suis pour ma daronne
J'ai promis au daron d’honorer ses sacrifices
Pour devenir un bonhomme son histoire c'est ma notice
Ma famille et mes amis que j'ai depuis la 6ème
Je suis riche de leur présence plus que de la Sacem
Les artifices du show bizz ne collent pas à mes principes
Faudrait que je fasse le voyou pour plaire à des journalistes
Donc fuck you
J'dis ça avec enthousiasme
Je ne serai pas la caricature de tous vos fantasmes
Je garde mon image, mes principes, mes valeurs
En hommage à cette jeunesse qui se bat pour ses couleurs
A l'heure ou le FN a brandi le flambeau
A l'heure ou le FN me veut dans un grand zoo
Je combat le racisme et toutes ces idées grotesques
Prend garde à la banane à la Dani Alves
Au moins pour Inaya, Luna, Lenny
Au moins pour ceux qui croient en Cosmopolitanie",Préface

Ti amo, ti amo

Elle était à Venise pour les vacances
1 mètre 70, aucun enfant
Célibataire jeune cadre oui elle
52 kilos, vingt-six ans
Passionné de romance elle attend
Que le destin lui fasse un petit signe, que la chance
Lui sourit enfin
Oui, à elle qui a trop eu son cœur aux urgences
Mais une péniche arrive à contresens
Deux regards se croisent par inadvertance
Elle tombe sous le charme et puis elle brise ce silence
Et ciao vengo di France
Allons prendre un verre, faisons connaissance
Ils finissent au Pullman puis elle lui chante à l'oreille tendrement

Ti amo

70 kilos, haut fonctionnaire
Passionné de musées il repense à sa vie de famille, à sa femme
Oui, il se dit qu'il a d'la chance
La routine n'a pas rouillé son alliance
Mais une péniche arrive à contre sens
Deux regards se croisent par inadvertance
Et d'un coup c'est le coup d'foudre
Oui son cœur devient fou
Elle propose de boire un verre
Il veut refuser mais son cœur fait l'contraire
Il finit au Pullman puis il lui chante à l'oreille lui aussi

Soprano,"Comme tous les matins avant d’aller sur le chantier
Il veut me parler de ses problèmes de foyer
Il me dit que ses enfants le rendent complètement fêlé
Que sa femme le trompe avec le voisin du palier
Et lui là-bas ne fait que nous rabâcher sa jeunesse
Qu’il était beau et riche, qu’il attirait toutes les gonzesses
Que dans son temps les jeunes avaient plus de politesse
Mais qu’aujourd’hui pour une cigarette ils t’agressent
Au fond de la salle j’entends qu’une bagarre éclate
Je cours les séparer avec ma fameuse batte
Je vois que le premier a sous la manche quelques cartes
Le deuxième le rate et me fout une patate

Oui, ils m’ont tous saoulé

Comme tous les midis, en sortant de son petit bureau
Il desserre sa cravate et il me parle de son boulot
Il décrit son patron avec des tas de noms d’oiseau
Il aimerait bien se taper sa secrétaire Véro
Et là y’a cette cougar au décolleté ravageur
Jupe léopard, maquillage de film d’horreur
Elle me raconte ses ébats sexuels sans pudeur
Avec ce petit jeune qu’est majeur depuis 24 heures
Et là d’un coup un homme monte sur la table
Avec son accent bizarre il nous traite de macaques
Il nous dit qu’à l’époque il était formidable
Puis il tombe dans mes bras en pleurant qu’il est fort minable

Ils m’ont tous saoulé

J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Toi qui me manque ici bas
J’ai besoin de te revoir
Toi qui me vois des étoiles
J’essaye de tourner la page
Mais je n’y arrive pas
Si j’ai la tête dans les nuages
C’est pour espérer t’apercevoir

Je te vois sur ce banc
Dans ce tout petit jardin
Le soleil nous sourit
Et le vent caresse tes cheveux châtains
Je m’accroche à chaque syllabe
Que tes lèvres jettent
Et mes yeux font les paparazzi
Sur tous tes gestes
Je me rappelle tes premiers pas, tes premiers mots
De ces couches qui t’faisaient marcher comme un sumo
T’avais ce petit air, innocent et fier
Te petits yeux clairs
Prouvaient que ta mère était une bijoutière
Mais ma fille, pourquoi tu te lèves, pourquoi tu pars?
Mais ma fille, pourquoi tout d’un coup tout devient noir?
D’un coup le réveil sonne, j’suis en sueur dans mon lit
J’me rends compte que

J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Et chaque réveil est un cauchemar
J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Toi qui me vois des étoiles
J’essaye de tourner la page
Mais je n’y arrive pas
Dis-moi pourquoi, pourquoi
Pourquoi, il t’a volé à moi

Y’a tes photos dans ma poche
Tes photos sur les murs
Tes photos de partout
Même tes photos sur la Lune
Je te croise tous les jours
À chaque carrefour
Mais quand je crie ton nom
Pourquoi tu fais la sourde?
Ils me prennent pour un fou
Quand j’te parle dans la rue
Monsieur je n’suis pas saoul
J’ai juste un peu bu
Je dors que dans ta chambre
Au milieu de tes poupées
C’est peut-être pour ça
Que ta Maman m’a quitté
Mais rien à foutre
Ils comprendront jamais notre relation
Ils auront beau crier que j’perds la raison
Toi tu restes ma fille, mon admiration
Oui toi tu es mon sang, ma perfusion
Il t’a volé à moi, au volant de sa vodka
Donc j'ai mis toutes mes peines
Dans le chargeur de mon arme
Ce soir j’veux le vider
Ne plus me réveiller
Rester à côtés, car

J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Et chaque réveil est un cauchemar
J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Toi qui me vois des étoiles
J’essaye de tourner la page
Mais je n’y arrive pas
Dis-moi pourquoi, pourquoi
Pourquoi, il t’a volé à moi

Il t’a volé à moi
Mais ils viennent de le libérer
Comment vivre avec ça?
Ce soir il est devant moi
Je suis prêt à te venger
Mais m’aimeras-tu après ça?

J’ai encore rêvé de toi
J’ai encore rêvé de toi
Et j’essaye de tourner la page
Mais je n’y arrive pas
Dis-moi pourquoi, pourquoi
Pourquoi, il t’a volé à moi

Rien à cirer, rien à battre réveillez moi quand tout s'arrête

Si je chante la cosmopolitanie c'est parce que j'en ai vu de toutes les couleurs
On m'a dit, on m'a dit petit, réveille-toi t'es un peu trop rêveur
Petit tu as un trop gros appétit la réalité est fade et sans saveur
Oublie tes rêves d'ados, comme tout le monde suis le troupeau
Mais le têtu que j'étais avait de la détermination plein le sac-à-dos
Aucune de leurs dissuasions m'a mis le genou à terre
Aucun médecin au monde ne pouvait soigner ma fièvre

Tout est possible quand t'assumes qui tu es

And I don't want my mind say, just my pain, my hunger and my cries

Fight, fight for who I am, and I will

Un rappeur positif pour donner de l'espoir à cette jeunesse désabusée
À l'heure où on nous braque avec un AK, 49.3 pour nous faire plier
Ma famille, ma famille, ma famille tout roule pour moi car ce sont mes moteurs
Mon carré VIP c'est mon cercle familial, pour eux j'brillais avant les projecteurs
I love you Comoria, I love you Massilia (Alléluia)
Mon image, mon discours, mon parcours, mon combat, tout ça c'est pour pouvoir leur faire honneur
Le cancer m'a volé un frère il n'y a que mes gosses pour éponger mes pleurs
Toujours debout à chanter que l'amour est le meilleur fusil contre la terreur
Je le décharge quand je chante, dans une MJC ou dans les Restos du Cœur
J'suis de retour plus humain que jamais envoyez-moi des sourires plus que des fleurs

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Con el tiempo las piedras se gastan
Con los a–os mis recuerdos cambian 

En la desolacion veo residuos de ti que han
Sobrevivido el rigor del tiempo
En la desolacion veo residuos de ti estas
Son las ruinas en mi mente

En la desolacion veo residuos de ti que han 
Sobrevivido el rigor del tiempo
En la desolacion veo residuos de ti estas

Soraya ,"I have spent too many nights
Wondering what wrong did I do
Was it something I said
Or did my silence haunt you
Never meant for you to question
Didn't intend to enrage
You say I've got a way with words
You say I always run to them 

Tonight I feel abandoned
By the muse of my heart
Tear by tear 
I feel us tearing apart 
Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry. 

Do you ever remember
What it was once like
How you would move every mountain
Just to be by my side
Now I feel that I must struggle
Just to get into your mind

Can't you hear me I'm hanging
Won't you let me in tonight 

Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry 

Tonight I feel abandoned
By the muse of my heart
Tear by tear I feel us tearing apart 
Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry",Avalanche
Soraya ,"When I am with you
Don't want the world to move
Want to freeze it
Maybe wrap it up and keep it
Steady now, so I won't lose you 

When I am with you
It's like colors keep shining through
From lighter to darker
Then richer to weaker
They're blended till I'm all lost in you

With a sudden turn my insecurity burns
I 'm thrown into the whirlwind of doubt
All the love that I now feel slips away from me until
I am isolated without you

If this is the calm before the storm
I fear the end is near
So I look behind the words you say
And try to find
Your way out of here
What will be
Your way out of here
What will be
Your way out of here 

When I am with you
Sometimes I don't know what to do
Would you believe me
If I were to tell you
That this craziness is all over you

With a sudden turn my insecurity burns
I 'm thrown into the whirlwind of doubt
All the love that I now feel slips away from me until
I am isolated without you 

If this is the calm before the storm
I fear
The end is near
So I look behind the words you say
And try to find
Your way out of here
If this is the calm before the storm
I fear
The end is near so",Calm Before the Storm
Soraya ,"Did you ever imagine being here
I must remind myself that it's real as
I stroll through the memories of that day
I smile as I recall everything you said

Didn't think I would find it
Wasn't sure if it was there to be found
But I turn and see the love in your eyes
Warm as the sun and gentle as the night

I've been swept off my feet
Don't ever want to touch the ground
You have raised me high above
Any love that I've ever found
Any love that I've ever found 

Tonight as I watch you sleep
Your serenity makes me weak
How you fought your way through the dark
To plant your love deep within my heart

I've been swept off my feet
Don't ever want to touch the ground
You have raised me high above
Any love that I've ever found

I've been swept off my feet
Don't ever want to touch the ground
You have raised me high above
Any love that I've ever found 

Only death will us do part
Even then our love will remain",Love in Your Eyes
Soraya ,"It's late in the evening
And I know I'm not where I should be
Anyplace and everything is lonely
When you're not with me
And I wrap your arms around me
As if they could protect me from
Anything and everything
That comes my way 

Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
I need to know, before I fall in love

I'm walking down the street
Searching for something to entertain me
To keep my mind
From missing you
But nothing can satisfy me
The way you do without even trying
With your easy ways
And that look in your eyes 

Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
I need to know, before I
I need to know, before I 
I need to know, before I fall in love 

And when it's late at night
Do you dream of me holding you tight
Cause I think of you all the time
And I wonder do thoughts of me invade your mind

Indeed to know before I
I need to know before I
I need to know before I fall in love",Need to Know
Soraya ,"No matter what anyone says time doesn't pull you through
Cause there are nights when I still cry when I think of you
Sometimes it swallows me in this space I feel inside
But I think of how strong you were and it
Helps me to get by 

And all the times when you would come to
Me in my dreams
I thought I was losing my mind, but it's the
Sanest I've ever been
And on those days when life seems too much
I hear your voice and I'm comforted by your touch

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me
On nights like this I know you're in a better place
On nights like this I pray

I may be with you again someday
On nights like this I pray
That I may be worthy someday

There's the anger that blocked out the light
There's the doubts that held me captive night after night
The endless hours I spent asking why
When there's so many evil people, it just doesn't seem right 

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me
On nights like this
I know you're in a better place

On nights like this I pray
I may be with you again someday
On nights like this I pray
That I may be worthy someday 

And I remember the night when I held you in my arms
Trying to give you the strength, the will to hold on
And you looked in my eyes and said ""baby be strong
I don't want to leave you but it's time for me to go"" 

And at that moment, as your hand slipped out of mine
A tear rolled down as you closed your eyes for the last time
And all the pain that had been written on your face
Suddenly disappeared and by a smile it was replaced

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me
On nights like this
Know you're in a better place
On nights like this
I pray I may be with you again someday

On nights like this I pray
That I may be worthy someday",On Nights Like This
Soraya ,"Saw a vision in the middle of the day
Reality slipped a million miles away
As my mind wandered its spirit embraced me
And brought me closer to this reason to believe 

Got a handful of burning questions
Living with the burden of good intentions
Having spent years reading between the lines
Hoping something would stir my mind

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free 

When I was a girl
And everything was still on my side
The urgencies of certain things were
Hugging at my side
Now the clock is ticking harder 
And the years are spinning by
Faster than I should want them to I find myself struggling
Against the same old fears
Through the years remained true

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe for a way to be set free
I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free",Reason to Believe
Soraya ,"Saw the ruins of a civilization fallen
Amidst the rubble I stood and haunted
How you and I once built a fortress
Tears shed to commemorate
The existence of a love that was so great
How you and I once thought we'd never hesitate

And the stones get rounded by the storms
So do my memories change as time rolls on

And as I walk through I see remnants of you that have
Survived the harshness of time
And as I walk through I see remnants of you all
These these ruins in my mind
These ruins in my mind

Through the corridors I followed
The beam of light and amidst the shadows
How you and I once knew what mattered

In the ruins I felt a history
Of what once was never again will be
How you and I once loved with such urgency 

And the stones get rounded by the storms
So do my memories change as time rolls on
And as I walk through I see remnants of you that have
Survived the harshness of time
And as I walk through I see remnants of you all

Soraya ,"As they were being said I wished those words were
Dead they grow and grow and grow in our heads
They linger, linger and haunt us days on end

It was all in a moment of anger these daggers that I threw
They're still deeply embedded into you
I swear I fear there's nothing I can do

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong 

I can see it in your eyes in the way you look at me
Mistrust has now replaced intimacy
I feel you drifting drifting far away from me

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong

I swear, I will fight this
I vow not to lose
I'll be damned if this destroys us
I'll be damned if I lose you

Soraya ,"A thousand eyes looking at me 
But yours is the look that goes right
Through me and I
Cannot hide from your stare
Should I let you in - do I dare
Some other hands have tried before
But yours is the touch that makes me
Want more and I
Cannot hide the urgency
To have you lying here with me because

Suddenly in my life
There's something that's got me
Mystified and I cannot fight it but ican try
To keep the wonder of it alive

A thousand words have tried to say
But yours are the ones that'll never
Fade away and I
Cannot hide from their sound
I am mesmerized spinning round and round
Some other hearts have tried to steal mine
But yours is the one that I now hold dear
I'll do what it takes to keep you here
I'm a selfish fool and I have no fear

Suddenly in my life
There's something that's got me
Mystified and I
Cannot fight it but I can try
To keep the wonder of it alive

A thousand times I've tried to stay
Alone by pushing you away
Time after time and tear after tear
I find myself back here with you
A thousand visions have come to me
All promising serenity
And as I struggle to find the source of this peace
I always end up with your kiss

Suddenly in my life
There's something that's got me
Mystified and I
Cannot fight it but I can try

Soraya ,"I was pacing every room with no where to turn
wondering if some things should ever be learned
I never thought that things would end up like this
when the initial intentions led only to bliss

Then I called the only friend that I could trust
asked him for a little time
my father answered the line and without asking much
he listened and then spoke his mind. He said:

Hay cosas en la vida, that will swallow your pride
Hay cosas en la vida that might deceive your mind
Hay cosas en la vida that will try to break your heart
Hay cosas en la vida, from them you must part

For endless hours he heard me go on
about how everything started to go wrong
it´s ironic how my whole life Ive been
chasing after some romantic dream

Often jealously takes on a good disguise
and changes someone before your eyes
Baby, dont look back and dont drown in reget
Your life can quickly pass you by

(Chorus)
Sometimes things are not quite what they seem to be
sometimes answers hit harder than steel
sometimes trust is more precious than diamonds
and all that glitters is not always real

I sent him all my love as I hung up the phone
sitting in the silence I didnt feel so alone
its always those who love you that stand by your side
when all the others just leave the pieces behind

That morning after felt like two bottles of gin
I still cant remember where Ive been
Ill cleanse my soul of all this false love Ive known
and make my fathers words my own.",Cosas en la Vida

Los sentimientos que mantengo en mi soñar
Algún día, quisiera enseñarte
Todo el cariño que llevo por ti

Por tantos años he sido tu amiga
Why todo el tiempo, he querido ser mas
Why los momentos que hemos compartido
Sólo me hacen quererte mas

Como quisiera revelar mis intenciones
Como quisiera que sintieras esta pasión por mi
Es un amor, que siempre ha sido tuyo
Es un amor, que sólo yo lo se

Es un amor, que corre por mis venas
Es un amor, con el deseo, moriré

En tus ojos, crece mi palpitar
Cuando estas cerca, deberia correr
Del temor, que esta vez no resistiré

Algo que me persigue
Algo que me llena de recuerdos del ayer
Ya lo debo saber , ya lo debo comprender
Cuando se presenta, no hay mas que pueda hacer

Te lleva lejos de aqui
Donde yo estuve una vez
Donde yo nunca jamas
Pense que iba a volver

Cuando veo a esa niña
Cuando veo su mirar
Aunque el esfuerzo es grande
Es imposible olvidar

Lucho con su imagen
Su recuerdo, su pasado
Lucho con el sentimiento
De ver que me la han robado

Te lleva lejos de aqui
Donde yo estuve una vez
Donde yo nunca jamas
Pense que iba a volver

Si me voy de aqui
No tarda en encontrarme
Me amenaza why dice
Nunca vas a matarme

why le pregunto cuando
Why como la perdi
Le pregunto si algun dia
Yo sere lo que fui

Donde yo nunca jamas

y pierdes la partida 
hoy juega la ruleta 
y en sus vueltas locas 
ganas oropel 

Si apuestas al amor

cuantas tristezas, 
cuantos desenganos. 

Te quedas cuando el amor se aleja 
amas las noches negras 
sin lunas y sin estrellas

Prometiste protegerme, juraste nunca partir

Extra–ando a quien fui antes del primer hello 
Los recuerdos, los sue–os sin cumplir
No pueden ser mas claros, todo se puede finjir.

Tu why yo, nunca quise nada mas 
Todo en mi vida, tiene tu huella detras 
Entre besos me decias, que antes de mi no existias
Que en mis ojos brilla tu verdad. 

Con cada declaracion, 
Perfeccionabas tu guion 
why yo creia apreciar, escuchar mi gran amor.
Se que perdi lo que te di why hay
Otra que esta detras de mi 
No llorare un dia mas por ti 
Entre la pasion why el amor 
Hay una fina distincion 
La mentira no la inspira el corazon.

Soraya ,"Anoche me dormí­ abrazando las nubes
Con almohadas de sueños en una cama de ilusiones
Desde niña me imaginé esta vida
Cruzando retos para llegar a mi cima
En un instante perdí­ toda la certeza
Las dudas y el rencor se marcaron en mi esencia

Será una pesadilla, no puede ser verdad
Me despierta un derrumbe
Empiezo a deslizar

Casi se me acaba la fe
Casi se me escapa el amor
Casi se me quiebra la inocencia
Se me agota toda la fuerza para luchar un dí­a más
Casi me rendí­ hasta que pensé en ti
Casi me rendí­ pero pensé en ti

Veo en mi reflejo un rostro traicionado
Frente al fantasma de un cuerpo cansado
Por qué hoy, por qué yo, por qué esto?
Preguntas con respuestas que vendrán solo con el tiempo

Será una pesadilla no puede ser verdad

Encontrarás entre su ritmo y el silencio la razón

Soraya ,"I know you have your reasons
I know you have your ways
Doesn't make it any easier
To learn to walk again

And you said it would be better
As I swallowed back my tears
I could wait for you forever
I said what you wanted to hear

I gave my word
That I'd be fine
I promised you I'd never lie
But honestly, every time a thought of you
Crosses my mind

I lie through my teeth
I lie with a smile
I lie with the strength
Of a train running wild

I break the truth
Every time I breathe
With every lonely heartbeat
I lie, I lie for you

Beginnings are so easy
The middles such a climb
The endings are the worst of all
Someone's always left behind

Do you miss me when it's raining?
Is this yearning only mine?
I agreed because I love you
I was hoping that time might change your mind

I gave my word
That I'd be fine
I promised you I'd never lie
But honestly, every time a thought of you
Crosses my mind

I lie with the strength
Of a train running wild

Me cerraste como a un libro

Prometí no llorar

Pero en verdad cada vez
Que pienso en ti
Vuelvo a caer

Miento con la fuerza de un tren al pasar
Miento por tus besos, miento en mi respirar
Miento para engañarme, miento para olvidar

Hay tanto por saborear
La despedida nos traiciona
Un corazón se queda atrás

Cuando llueve te hago falta
No me has podido reemplazar
Sigo fiel a la esperanza
Que un día la vida te hará regresar

Es el recuerdo de un abrazo al atardecer
Entregar mi cuerpo al poder de tus manos

Es mi alma inquieta pidiendo ternura
Son mis labios hambrientos buscando tu figura
Tus caricias que navegan con sumo cuidado
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Cierro mi ojos. . . caigo en tus sueños
Pido un deseo. . . escucho tu voz
Muevo montañas para estar a tu lado
Darle vida a la esperanza de ser amado

Es perderme en tus ojos y encontrar un hogar
Es tenerte a mi lado cada mañana al despertar
Ver caer la lluvia arropada en tus brazos
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Es bailar contigo aunque no haya canción
Es recibir un regalo sin tener ocasión
Abrir lo que siempre he tenido cerrado

sin diploma, sin un centavo, se ganó el corazón de un pueblo
sin conocer a sus padres, sin abrazar a sus hermanos

un tono en tu hablar
algo en ti me hipnotiza.

me quiero entregar

me tengo que entregar

No tienes por que hablar
Tus ojos te han delatado

Perdona si no lloro
O no comienzo a gritar
Mis emociones se han gastado

No querido confrotar lo
Que estaba frente a mí
Cerre mis ojos para nunca
Verte ir

¿En dondé estas?

Que no me quieres llevar
Cuando fue que yo te
Empece ha estorbar
¿En donde estas?

Que no te puedo acompañar
Que pasó entre los dos
Que fue que hicimos mal

Quizas yo fallé
Al preguntarte a donde vas
Quizas por dentro lo temia

Pense que al no decirlo nada hiba ha pasar
Te soñado siempre en mi vida
Tantas dudas nunca les di razón
Cuantas noches añorabas otra voz

¿En donde estas?
Que no me quieres llevar
Cuando fue que yo te
Empece a estorbar

¿En donde estas?

Que no te pueda acompañar
Que pasó entre los dos
Que fue que hicimos mal

Quiero saber que es lo
Que piensas
Si debi luchar por ti
O si yo ya te perdí

¿En dondé estas?
Que no me quieres llevar
Cuando fué que yo te
Empece ha estorbar

¿En donde estas?

Que no te puedo acompañar
Que paso entre los dos
Que fué que hicimos mal

¿Porqué te fuiste?

Cuando fue que yo te
Empece ha estorbar

 Muero de dolor 
al verte así. 
Hoy es tan frío 
el espacio entre los dos. 

El universo 
yo era para ti. 
Y en la rutina 
se murió el amor 

Vuelve junto a mí 
Te pido vuelve a mí. 

Vuelve junto a mí, 
que me muero si no estás, 
ya no esperes más, 
dame un poco más de ti. 
Te pido vuelve a mí, 
que me grita el corazón, 
que no puedo más, 
y mi alma rota está. 

Vuelve junto a mí. 
Mi mundo entero te lo di... 

Hoy un día más 
para este adiós. 
Somos extraños 
que discuten sin razón. 
Pasan los días 
sin pedir perdón, 
cae al vacío 
lo que nos unió. 

Vuelve junto a mí, 
que me muero si no estás, 
ya no esperes más, 
dame un poco más de ti. 
Te pido vuelve a mí, 
que me grita el corazón 
que no puedo más 
y mi alma rota está. 

Vuelve junto a mí 
Te pido vuelve a mí. 

Aún nos queda tiempo y sueños 
para hacer realidad. 
Un gran amor que nunca morirá. 
Hoy te espero aquí... 

Vuelve junto a mí, 
que me muero si no estás

Vuelve junto a mí

Soraya,"Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel

So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers

Sorrow,"Anger and bitterness growing
I'm not always feeling this way
But as time's end draws closer
Pain's a larger percentage of the day
To seek an answer for my grief
I must realize from the start
I'm trying to feel compassion
For a species with no heart
Misunderstood, I've tried to be good
But You think You all know me
Unknown to You, all that I do
Has meaning You probably can't see
Judged by looks, when You are the crooks
Because You steal my emotions
Within my state, there exists much hate
Forced into me by Your notions
Undetected sadness, my worst enemy
Forces tears, nobody sees
You leave me no choice
But to despise all Your worth
You cause my pain
Never will I give in
",Forced Repression
Sorrow,"Curse the priest
Rape the nun
Kill Jesus Christ
Spit at the church
Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence
Overwhelmed by hate
Ridicule the cross around Your neck
Set the torah a blaze
Religions are worthless and for the weak
Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence
For God
For religion
For worship
Hatred and disgust
For the values You set
Ban all religions
Decay is all You get
Burn the churches and temples
Burn them to the ground
Who cares what they saw?
Rejoice at the mound
",Human Error
Sorrow,"Fools! Stop waving Your flag
And clean the shit off Your glasses
Freedom of speech, a government lie
To calm and quiet the masses
Freedom of speech exists
If what You say is accepted by the majority
One will quickly lose
That right when they are part of the minority
All popular artists are the same
This is no coincidence
Maybe the public would not respond to
Deviants
That is an incorrect inference
People with money and power are blessed
But they can fund and promote
Subversive ideas they have intentionally
Suppressed
To insure the safety of status quo
If one's ideas pose no threat
They are the ones to succeed
Monetary backing they will get
By the claws of corporate greed
True freedom of speech
Occurs when all ideas
Are given equal viewing
To the general public
Censor art
Suppress reflection of society
Censor thought
",Illusion of Freedom
Sorrow,"A humans thirst can never be quenched
Too much is never enough
Due to humans weak mind
Resistance is unbearably tough
Humans can not suppress their primal urges
Even in order to preserve their existence
In this enlightened age
Humans know what behaviour is safe
And what will lead to their own demise
The public ignores the facts
Instead they blame the scapegoats
To rationalize their acts
Putting Your life in someone's hands
The ultimate in naivete
Why would one be so trusting?
Why could You be so stupid?
Another's reassurance of safety
Supplies you with false security
Since the beginning of time
Humans have altered their sanity
First an occasional diversion
Then a constant necessity
You need chemicals to live
Chemicals need you to kill
The risk of one's actions
Can be greately reduced
Make a decision
Inconvenience or death
Govern Your life by intellect
Not by instinct
",Insatiable
Sorrow,"Prejudice, does this word apply to you?
Categories, most likely to be friends
With someone just like You
Are You a human, or do You rely on
Separative adjectives?
Pride (Vox By Billy)
Why do You take credit
For what You were born into?
Do Your genes give You an advantage?
Favoritism
Taking care of Your own kind
Continuing
Your own kind
Words
SAy what You mean
Mean what You say
Hatred, afraid to accept
People different from You
Afraid to rethink
Your own values
Peace, it won't happen
Until barriers are eradicated
",Separative Adjectives
Sorrow,"Time and time again
Throughout the centuries
How many times
Must it be repeated?
A countless number
Of treatise
And all too few
Have absorbed their meaning
Regarded as prodigies
But You ignore the messages
Of these few
Perceived as honorable
And You can't find
The inner strength
To take to heart
Our responsibilities
And You have seen
The results from afar
Of perpetual neglect
Without a trace
Of empathy
So it will continue
That the words of wisdom
Will be ignored
Leaving us back
Right where we started
Wallowing aimlessly
In a world of ignorance

Sorry About Dresden,"She was holding somebody?s hand, 
I forget who it was I am. 
Giving up the crusades for a while,
I can't crawl another mile. 
The rags are torn, 
The sheets are tattered, 
Rat-a-tat and all the tribes scattered. 
She'll be hanging out in hotel rooms, 
I'll be tucked away in underground tombs. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades, 
When I realized no one could be saved. 
Dusty gashes we were seeing, 
This giant airfield came into being. 
The harnessed power and force of a million;
Faithful followers who sold their children.
Some return with souvenirs, 
Stick a heart in your boutonnière. 
Some return with tales of glory, 
All the fucking stories bore me. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades,
When I realized no one can be saved. 
Say I know when I just don't know.
Say I love you, I don't just know. 
I was a pretender to the throne, 
I knew my cover?d be blown. 
Never could be that dogmatic, 
Whose to blame if I just heard static? 
Never known the truth of a zealot,
Whose to blame if I just can't spell it? 
Never known true righteousness 
Just the safety and vague red lust. 
I know I'll be back again someday.",Crusades

بَدا في سَوادِ اللَيلِ فَرداً يَمانِيا
فَقُلتُ لَهُ بَل نارُ لَيلى تَوَقَّدَت
بِعَليا تَسامى ضَوءُها فَبَدا لِيا
فَلَيتَ رِكابَ القَومِ لَم تَقطَعِ الغَضىa

خَليلَيَّ إِن تَبكِيانِيَ أَلتَمِس
خَليلاً إِذا أَنزَفتُ دَمعي بَكى لِيا
فَما أُشرِفُ الأَيفاعَ إِلّا صَبابَةً
وَلا أُنشِدُ الأَشعارَ إِلّا تَداوِيا
وَقَد يَجمَعُ اللَهُ الشَتيتَينِ بَعدَما

So much to take, so much to leave behind

You don't think of the dead, you think of dignity
Picked you up by the side of your head, you were half dead
Say your prayers and put you to to bed

And the fool he has made
It's a Jack of all trades and the fool he has made

And she gave me this look I could not believe
And the cold stare remained; I wanted to leave

See, I do believe anger is offset by sorrow
But you destroy today you might regret tomorrow
When you're young and defensive it comes off offensive
And it's hard to repay the tolerance that you borrowed
The lasting relationship sinks right off the pier
Who wears the pants; it's faded but clear

She's your girlfriend, seems she ain't too fond of me
I guess if that's the way it was meant to be
There we were, just we three
You, your girlfriend, and me

I've known you forever, you two just met
So easily amused; how fast we forget
In my jealously, my self-righteous greed
She's a bit like a book I'm too far sighted to read
And I wish you the best, I sometimes feel the need
To say remember me

She's your girlfriend, as far as we can see
Does she look at you the way she looks at me
And here we are, just we three

The street lights reflect the light in the water
The string it snaps and the pearls go sailing
And they splash and bounce and roll 'cross the wet street

As she bends to chase the pearls a car swings 'round the corner
She darts from the eyes of the panic-struck driver
Who's racing to the delivery room
'Cause in the back seat his wife is busting out of her womb

And the sack breaks and out come the Siamese Twins

With a broom and a knife and blood on his hands

And he sweeps everything under the rug
And goes home to his kids and gives them a hug
But his wife was not there, she had just left a letter
That said ""you'd be much better off without me""

Now his wife took the train to her ex-lover's funeral
Who died in the bathroom, hit his head on a urinal
When they got together, the knowledge was carnal
And the widow was at the funeral, and they had quite a catfight

And they fell into the hole where the casket was resting
And the preacher just left in the middle of the service
'Cause death was one thing, but women made him nervous
And he ran to his car and he drove 'round the corner

Then something in the street caught the light in his eye
He pulled over, reached down, and picked up a pearl from the gutter
And he didn't know what to think
And he brought it home and washed it in the sink

And he gave the pearl to Sister Mary Teresa

But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than god, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And l.i.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows
The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e",Sunshine
Soul Decision,"My love
You were the one thing in my life
That I treated bad
Sometimes enough I made you cry

And I know the way I made you feel was wrong
(I left you sad and lonely)
The things I did, the words I said were much to strong
And I swear if you come back to me

I'll do things much differently
If you were here today
This is what you'd hear me say
We could have been so good together

Couldn't we give it just one more try?
I thought that we would last forever
But now you're gone and I think I know why
I guess I should have said I am sorry

Maybe things wouldn't be this way heaven knows I love you baby
If you love me, baby come back to me
All the times that I made you cry
I'm sorry don't you say goodbye

I wish I had this chance to love you more
(Love you I love you)
But now you're gone I can't go on
I'm all alone

And I swear if you come back to me
I'll do things much differently
If you were here with me today
This is what you'd here me say

Tonight I'm only thinking of you
Feeling sorry for myself that's all I can do
Without you here I know I'd fall apart
So at night I dream of holding you in my arms
(At night I dream you're in my arms)
(Ooh baby baby)
If you were here with me today",Baby Come Back

I'm gonna move in nice and close
Ain't nobody gonna interrupt my game

I've been trying to figure out 
What I can say to you to get some play 
Couldn't we do what we did last night again 
Baby you and I'd be better than friends 
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further? 
Every night when we say goodbye 
How can I help looking in your eyes? 
Wondering why you and I haven't hit it 
Can we get it on 

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright 
Thinking about making my move tonight 
I can't pretend that you're only my friend 
When you're holding my body tight 
â??Cause I like the way you're making it move 
I like the way you're making me wait 
At the end of the night when I make up your mind 
You'll be coming on home with me 

Yeah you know you got it 
And you know I want it 
I can't wait to take you home (you know you got it and I)

You spent like my D's the way we compensated; 
Just another day around the way 
With me up close so every thing OK.

Indecision with the best 
Plus for my full court press 
Because they hated- 
How's it go?

Something deep inside me says
Nothing that I've ever seen
Could ever be compared

Still I've seen it all before

Go to get to know you better

Baby I've got to know you now
I envision us together
I'm feelin' you without even knowing you
No one else will ever do

So I've got to tell you, oh I'm
Feelin' you without even touching you
I saw you instantly I knew
That I have to make you mine

Never thought I'd ever find
Then you stepped up in my mind
Just one look from you and then
My heart was blown away

You got me with you attitude
That confidence that you exude
I can tell your flavor would be
Oh so good to taste

Could it be we could get any closer?
Baby I've got to know you now

Simply irresistible

And I lose my back bone
Leave my feelings unknown

This is all so hard
Letting down my guard
It's all the same, it's you I blame
But maybe that's not right
So I'll blame, Gravity
For always holding out on me
When I just want to run away
It trips me and I fall for you

How easy this could be
I can put the blame on Gravity

Truly unbelievable
And certainly achievable

Simple things, I complicate

Next time I won't care about no one
That's right they can do it on their own
Next time you want to hurt somebody well it's to late I'm already gone

And I could never walk three steps behind (I never follow)

I won't be their fool, I couldn't do it all again no

On the same plane, in the same pane
But I'm movin', movin' in a new direction

Hot to make you unwind

Well, ain't that the way it's supposed to be?
Are you feeling free?

Go forth, achieve your ambitions
Your goals, your aims, whatever you claim to be yours
If that's the nature of this game

The game is life and life's so hard
Even more if you get down with the wrong card
Well, play to win, don't give in
'Cause seriously, I'll tell you something

It ain't no joke 'cause if you can't cope
And your whole life's going up in smoke

Well, this society is sayin' what you can and can't do
But in my mind as I say is that true?
Like the man that they said is unemployable
How could he ever live a life enjoyable?

When he faked the feelings of no use
After all take the abuse and shame recall the promenade
How could he ever be in the right frame of mind?
When his life is unkind

Nobody wants to take the time to say
Listen there's another way
You don't have to live your life in this downtrodden way
Maybe your job isn't the answer

But take a look up
And take a glance at the alternatives
And what it has to give and put that in the way
That you wanna live your life, yeah

Do what you wanna do
Really what you wanna do
Whatever comes to you naturally
I mean feeling free

And it goes
Tu, are you, tu, are you, tu, are you, tu, are you

Tu, are you, tu, are you, tu, are you, tu, are you

Yo, so if you ever havin' a problem
Don't run and hide, come out and face it head on
Because you're strong enough to win
And go on to pass through the test that life has to offer

And beat it with ease and be on top of the cloud
All the while and when you finished that
Emerge with a smile upon your face and that way
We'll have a happy face and funky face for a loving race

Some people call it a reunion and some a conclusion
Well, I just like the people to form their own opinions
But most importantly I guess, enjoy
Soul II, Soul II Soul

But of course it was the unorthodox style
I guess the attitude that we had during that time
The late 80's, early 90's
Well, I think it surprised a lot of people
Of course the sound

Well, we weren't really trying
To imitate nobody or copy anybody
It was just a whole new concept
Soul II soul, Soul

Are Soul II Soul still real?
For real

Well, of course we were fortunate enough
That our timing was good
And I guess the people behind us
You know they worked real hard

And again I guess the public were ready
To accept something new
You know how we did

Yeah, for real, we're looking forward
To visiting different territories
We've never been to before
Also looking forward to visiting the places
We have been to before
So we will see you there

That you're a man and you don't play

처음엔 지루한

모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼

그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

Aight..
it went down like this
a day just like today
just...doing my thing, you know?

[Chorus X2]
Look before you leap, walk before you run
run from anything that threatens peaceful existence
Look before you leap, walk before you run
run as far as you can until you reach a safe distance
we've been running from day one
never even thought to ask why or what from
only taught to run, only taught to run
only taught to run, only taught to run

I learned how to walk at age one
and wasn't satified until I learned how to run
at age eighteen I didn't want to run
but I had to run from the shots fired by a gun
forty-eight hours, two cycles of the sun
I couldn't run from the shock that paralyzed my tongue
it made not want to speak a word to anyone
felt like the breath had been stolen from my lungs
who would've told my mother that she lost her youngest son
tears in her eyes standing there feeling stunned
to hear that her baby fell victim to a gun
playing basketball outside having fun
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
so I grew up thinking I'd never reach twenty-one
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
but I'm still here, cause I learned how to run

[Chorus X2]

my inner city people
put your hands up if you're feeling me
I'm not alone running from fear of cops killing me
running from utilities, running from responsibilities
running from flashbacks and memories
it's funny how we run into the arms of strong women
run away when its time to talk about commitment
I've seen women, run away from Mr. Right
then turn around and say that there ain't no good men in sight
even thugs run when the streets turn into hell
some run to the cops cause its safer in a cell
some cats used to run the streets and act fool
got robbed and didn't run but they had to run their jewels
some used to run shit on basketball courts
they got kids now running from child support
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
sometimes I wish that we never learned how to run

Soulfly,"Yo, life's web wants me in debt and tries to collect my breath 
As ransom in return for my soul's silhouette.
How deep does shit get? 
Is it worth the Bentley's 
And jets in this jungle of sheer cons 
And devils with breasts. 
I mean does everything happen for a reason, 
The change of seasons, 
Even the slugs screamin' to stop you from breathin'. 
It seems we're all a target in this mosh pit. 
The world be spinnin' lopsided, that's
Why I have my logic. 

We are what we are, musical contrast
Sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast
Sound clash, bomb blast 
So don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
Don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

My conspiracy theory threatens national security, speaking clearly, 
You assholes don't hear me. 
Walked the psychopath of Timothy Leary 
When cell therapy wasn't curing me, 
God put fear in me, scaring me. 
R-I-P Kamau Jahi, quiet warrior with dignity, 
Still with me spiritually, forever in memory. 
Cut throat, who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. 
You reap what you sow, 
So I try my hardest to harvest good crops regardless 
If most artists are garbage
With godless content. 
To be honest, the chronic plus my fondness of alcoholic products 
Held my spirit in bondage like convicts. 

Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
Overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. 
Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut friends out my circumference I used to run with. 
Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', 
I got one in the oven, 
Plus my girl's talkin' husband, she buggin'. 
My method of flowin' expression through poem, 
Salt of the Earth like the ocean, God's chosen spokesman. 
Creation to cremation, to be blatant, fuck Satan, 
Paper chasin' motherfuckers facing damnation. 
Girls actin' fly with no interest in aviation, fuck station, radio
Waves is just radiation. 

We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
You don't feel when I bleed, when I scream, when I feel 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
You don't know how I feel, what is real, what's the deal 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Cutthroat Logic, 
The newest extension of the Soulfly Tribe 
From now until the day that I die. 
Can't you tell by the pain in my eyes 
That with this music I will bring my dream to life. 
Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, 
I wanna blow up right now 
But I know it takes time. 
Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
From 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. 
Underground to worldwide, I will never die, 
Forever my words in my rhymes they gonna keep me alive. 
So onward I strive each 
And every day of my life as I fight to keep K-RAB's dream alive. 
Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. 
Some things in life are fucked up,
Wish I could take 'em back. 
But I live life with no regrets 
So I just look back on life and laugh. 

We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
In memory of D-LOW I carry this pain 
We are what we are, I know you understand 
In memory of D-LOW I carved your name 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession 
And 5-percenters studying lessons 
While the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols, 
Claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles, to rival. 
My recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial, 
I'm trying to make the finals. 
March madness in the land of savages, 
I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic, nomadic, 
What I'm tatted, my cross my only baggage, 
Roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. 
Brothas mastered mathematics and still they can't add it. 
My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it, 
Rock the planet, like volcanic magma fragments, 
As my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. 
I just wanna meet the trinity and live for infinity, 
Laugh at the enemy, when I get there who cares who remember me, on Earth. 

Since birth my dome had afro turf, ask the nurse, 
I heard a verse that said, ""who's last is first"", 
So I keep my flesh humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple, 
Average a triple double and keep my game subtle, 
Jam harder, than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter 
Since I slaughter holler, murda, on Shawn Carter,
No honor with robbers, 
So I pray to my godfather 
And my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.

But, all I really want to know is
Are you gonna lay the fuck back down
Or jump da fuck up?

Walking in the streets and looking at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fucking see

We got to fight the real enemy
Get the fuck up, stand the fuck up

And I don't care who stares or stays

Will you reach out if you can't resist?

Maybe you don't give a shit for the rest of us
But if you do, the time is now, if it ever was
If you're gonna fight, whatcha gonna do?
Jump da fuck up!

Compare me to your travesties
I only want to see you fight
The darkness you want to live your life by

Get ready for epitome, come on and pity me
Will you kill me if I say please?

What the hell
Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell
Come and get me, mom would never let me do it

And devils with breasts. 
I mean does everything happen for a reason, 
The change of seasons, 
Even the slugs screamin' to stop you from breathin'.

When cell therapy wasn't curing me, 
God put fear in me, scaring me.

Still with me spiritually, forever in memory. 
Cut throat, who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. 
You reap what you sow, 
So I try my hardest to harvest good crops regardless 
If most artists are garbage
With godless content. 
To be honest, the chronic plus my fondness of alcoholic products 
Held my spirit in bondage like convicts. 

Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
Overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. 
Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut friends out my circumference I used to run with. 
Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', 
I got one in the oven, 
Plus my girl's talkin' husband, she buggin'. 
My method of flowin' expression through poem, 
Salt of the Earth like the ocean, God's chosen spokesman.

From now until the day that I die. 
Can't you tell by the pain in my eyes 
That with this music I will bring my dream to life. 
Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, 
I wanna blow up right now 
But I know it takes time. 
Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
From 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. 
Underground to worldwide, I will never die, 
Forever my words in my rhymes they gonna keep me alive. 
So onward I strive each 
And every day of my life as I fight to keep K-RAB's dream alive. 
Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. 
Some things in life are fucked up,
Wish I could take 'em back. 
But I live life with no regrets 
So I just look back on life and laugh.

I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession 
And 5-percenters studying lessons 
While the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols, 
Claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles, to rival. 
My recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial, 
I'm trying to make the finals. 
March madness in the land of savages, 
I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic, nomadic, 
What I'm tatted, my cross my only baggage, 
Roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. 
Brothas mastered mathematics and still they can't add it. 
My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it, 
Rock the planet, like volcanic magma fragments, 
As my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. 
I just wanna meet the trinity and live for infinity, 
Laugh at the enemy, when I get there who cares who remember me, on Earth. 

Since birth my dome had afro turf, ask the nurse, 
I heard a verse that said, ""who's last is first"", 
So I keep my flesh humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple, 
Average a triple double and keep my game subtle, 
Jam harder, than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter 
Since I slaughter holler, murda, on Shawn Carter,
No honor with robbers, 
So I pray to my godfather 
And my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

Mine on D and I grind like a O.G.
I got 12 diamond chains like a Ozzy
Follow me like de wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cuz it is so mean
Ask about me in da streets I spit so heat
Ain't nobody in da game messing with my click
Style swift hot like itz July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn't
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy!, it's not fair

Soulja Slim,"Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with why'all
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin' to ball
Dog, you ain't never seen what I seen what I seen",Imagine

Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot

Put 'em up in the air if you bout makin' dollars
And you be bout this real shit
That be to hard to swallow
Come, follow?

The home of the soldiers
If not committed they will cut throat ya
Play brawl then go to
Soldier streets but don't sleeps
And shots to knock ya off ya feet
Specialise in assassinatin', all bustas who be soldier hatin'
My bodygaurd is the Lord
Mines in the back of my head
My dogg, a born killa
Treal nigga
Been runnin' with me since I was small
a lot of y'all probably know him, then again ya probably don't
Cause its sung to strugglin' that be ridin'
With head biters in the trunk
Elliotts name was double crosser
He'll double cross ya, when he woulda taught ya
Told me not to get my hand dirty
He'll be my nigga tosser
Tellin' me to do my rap thing
No Limit bring me out there
Just chill, and make my mills
With my skills and keep it real

Chorus-1:
That's a, born killa
1- A treal nigga
2+3- Big time, dope dealer
A real nigga, that get it how I live on it
Fuck with born killas, dope dealers and real niggaz
Ill niggaz, and treal niggaz
That get it how the live nigga
Born killaz
Dope dealers
And treal niggaz
That get it how they live

The real niggaz, stay real
And the fakes stay fake
And you's a busta type nigga
Then stay the fuck outta my face
Because I'm tryin' to stay busta free
But y'all not hearin' me
Its nuts or cuffs
Get it how you live, on these city streets
And every nigga roam,
Gotta be Bout It Bout It
Niggaz pourin' syrup in the game
They not bein' solid
And that's the busta type
Niggaz I can't fuck with so I stay my distance
And run with real soldiers that love me
Only a handfull, duck and holler back
Real niggaz for sure got my back
All about the combat
All of the rest of 'em dead
Bread, ridin' red
A big dope dealer I used to fuck with doin' time in the vet
No need to say his name, my nigga used to slang them thangs
O-Z's and kilos
Heard the smack mayne
He used to give me grams
Never wanted to give me weight
He knew my habit, had me out there, he was goin' to get blazed
I respect that by me bein' an addict
I was, here I had to snort about half a gram to get me a buzz

Chorus-2

I got sent to the old jail, where a lot of niggaz don't survive
I rolled on the till bout a quarter of five
Got up early in the mornin'
Four feet up old mill
Guess who till rep
My dogg Cheer Will
He gave me five scoops, cause I just rolled in
But I gave that shit away
Cause my head bone bent
A murder charge in three attempts
What the fuck you expectin'?
I'm facin' life in prison, with a leathal injection
But these dick suckin' DA's
They refuse the charge
I rolled off B1, makin' boo-koo noise
Screamin' those bitches can't hold a Soulja like me down
Then my pajamas, socks and T-shirts, with a tank from ? town
I ain't stay out, cause thirty days
I come right back in this bitch
Probation violation, gotta do a year in six
I bet you dick suckers won't see me
No mothafuckin' more
I got big plans, ya understand?
By slangin' lyrics like dope
To all my people locked down, y'all be home in a second
Just keep it real, and stay treal and make them bitches respect ya

Always live the street life,
Never knew how to treat life
Knew once I get my shit right, it was gonna be right
I see life, and I'm livin' up to my dreams
It was a hard struggle
But that was only just for a nigga to bubble
Some of my people made it, and some of my people didn't
But I'm gonna ball for why'all, big baby
And ball actin' crazy
And watch my back, for the shady nigga tryin' to do me somethin'
I'm ballin' cause my rhyme done threw me something
Hard labor, and hard times
After hard rhymes
Glad I ain't got the glock no more
Takin' what's yours and call it mine
I called my moms' today,
She asked me did I pray?
I told her, I got to, cause the streets I'm roamin' on is one way

[Chorus]

See the street life be shady
I wonder, if my parents knew before they made me?
That shit's crazy
Will I survive this shit?
Maybe
But see, I've been strugglin' and hustlin'
Ever since my, grandmother was a baby
You think I'd be sayin' to myself
How many more days you leave jail?
When I can be on the street with my peep nigga
Countin' some mill
Hypnotized by fast thangs, fast cars and fast bitches
I'm tryin' to have fast things, can you dig it?
(What's up?)
Hopin' outta 4 doors
(What you mean?)
Sittin' low in low-low's
Never fuck with, no I don't know hoes
For sho' hoes
Come from the South and no doubt I wear jibo's and polo's
Everything I ride is chrome and mo-mo's
can't' trust a few, cause that's a no no
You gotta watch your back, cause niggaz will jack
That's why I stay strapped with 4-4's
See, I'm tryin' to have enough money to turn every project into a condo
Every nigga I don't like, to wino's
and every girl that alright, to fine hoes
And my next contract
Negotiate for 89 O's
Now see, the street life be hard, but I still drop the top
And niggaz be lookin' at me all mad, so I cock the glock

I'm tired of bein' broke
So I'ma keep mines out here with this weed and coke
Young nigga, rollin' with the ballers
Live my life for the day, cause there ain't nothin' promised for tomorrow

I'm tellin' ya they gone be smellin' ya
Under the Magnolia I'm a Soldier

[Chorus]
From what I was told again I'm a blow again
Fuck with these hoes again get exposed again
Mystikal I'm'a try to duck and dodge the pin
Never goin' back to the hole they threw me in
From what I was told

2001 you know The Streets Made Me
I got love for the streets",Intro
Soulja Slim,"You know how I'm coming (uh huh)
You know exactly how I'm coming
(I'm telling you) It don't stop
Shit don't stop

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My jacket consist of
Batteries on robberies, pistol charges, and murder
I know I'm the realest nigga ya heard of besides Pac
Got niggaz screaming Soulja from the street to the cell block

[Verse 1]
You bitchu
Soulja Slim and his committy is coming to getchu
My mag 90 bullets hitchu and splitchu
In half, let a bitch boy stab
Won't last up against these mother fuckers that use to taking blood baths
I been smoking blounts with the devil that's why my eyes are red as the fuck
Now tell me do I look like the type that will be scared to bust?
Well guess what? I'm screaming out murder me and I'm vest up
Chest up
Test nuts
Watch up while I fletch ya
You bitch made and I'm self made
Magnolia calia mag made
I get through like a scale blade
And Kunta Kente your left leg
I play surgeon and I'll be slpurgen
In anonymous nasty big bourbons
Don't stunt dog
Whatever I say I'll come withcha I'll come dog
I'ma get mine for the two G's
Take it for I say please
I fuck with twirkers not the twirkees
Put it long will give a nigga the herpes
So I stay back, I mean way, y'all didn't notice how I say that?
Well mother fuck y'all hated waving on three G's laid back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
As one time we was clicc tight
What the fuck going on? I just come home my shit ain't going right
Everybody branching off doing they thang
Some of 'em in the studio and some of 'em they slang
that's how it go I know this rap shit ain't gone last forever
So I stash cheddar for hard times flipping to make it better
I can take ten G's and make twenty more ten G's with that
I'm from the 6 'co circle where all the hustlers at
You busters scaking from round me with all that junk claiming
In 95' In random time remaining bust the brain in
Smoking blounts and snortin cane with my girl Big Ree
Til I started spooking out thought a nigga was trying to kill me
Nigga feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Picture lil daddy think he raw musta forgot I'ma vet
Crushing up his memory and then give him set for the flow of that
I gotta way of making all real niggaz feel my pain
Anymore player hating ass fake niggaz look at me strange
Reverse the game, Fuck his head up leave him in the middle of the street
Nigga shit ain't tight enough to geep a G with me
Actually, you don't even suppose to be in my presence
So I'ma ask you like a man, (shit) playboy get to stepping
Now if you walk off with that look like you gone get your weapon
And I'ma do ya something for all that stuntin and repping
Now as the beat on for my flirters stop
Til I make your drop it like its hot
I can run some shit that will make you pussy pop
Don't matter if you real or not
Play my game and I'll cheat on ya
Pull the rubber off and skeet on ya
Haters slanging that shit pussy for me on the Magnolia street corner
You's a hoe nigga
You I know nigga
And I put that on all my 6 'co fa sho niggaz
I'm X4L chief of the mag booyay
Fuck what them niggaz doing tomorrow cause I doing my thang today

Either you love me or love me not I'ma be me
I'm known for making promises that I can't keep
And baby the streets made me
And I run 'em 24/7 365 daily

[Verse 1]
Look you knew what you was dealing with from day one
I'm not a lil boy, yeah I'm young with a lot of old vet ways
Its only been a few days and so you say
You love me in a married way, yeah okay
I've been several types of relationships
And I feel your true love don't make no sense
Its all on me if I want this thang to work out
I know your goal is to try trap me that what you heard bout
I ain't been home in a few days cause you be traveling
I let you get your mind right cause I ain't with the kicking and scratching
I'm on parole, I can't be riding for domestic violence so I stay my distance
When there two ways to beat the pussy up and I'm bout my business
If I gotta beatcha then I don't need ya, let the next man do it
You done ran me away from you now, how you gone prove it
Being stupid, you done lost out
Now its next to the boss bitch with the boss mouth
You know what I'm talking bout

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Son say he seen me distributing something
You know that boy dirty, he didn't see me distributing nothing
So now its back doing jail time all over again
And josphine means bumping running working the pin
I only got 500 for me but I keep ten
But you my number one and you don't suppose to know about them
Deep in your heart you know I'm a true player boy
But its cool I take that nigga I take my player charges
I don't know why you making me promise to come home to you
Yeah I come to fuck but that's bout the only thang I can do
You noticed how I put the truth in front of the player
The world revolves round cane and that's why I take it there
God forgive me but I swear I think I'll never change
And I'm still stuck on that old saying no pain no gain
What said me not to be explain decision ya understand
I'm a man, so I gots to keep the upper hand
You know what I'm saying

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got feelings but my first real old lady left with'em
A refuse to give'em back, so I'm rolling like that
What I really loved is gone now
that's why I stay in another nigga house when he ain't home now
Putting that brod down player please don't feel played
She was uptown looking and got herself a true lover head
Your girl and all my hoes got my psyched up
Calling on caddy daddy just to get the right fuck
You best tighten up your game cause it hurting charlie
I pop a rodly feel my game tight than everybody
On the low you don't even know I got her pop it two
And that's just one of the thangs I know you couldn't make her do
It ain't nothing for me to take over a strong mind
Even Eve couldn't tell a bitch that love blind
I don't be lying when you asked for something its no's and yes'
She got my name on her thigh, her back, and her chest, like I'm depressed

I don't fuck around with him, he too dick in the booty
If I say the nigga name, then he'd prolly sue me
He hurting I'm rolling now, then keep it real
Making me or you, show me how
Stole the game, from the bitch nigga like that
There's over one million ways, you could get jacked
Well I'm a street jack artist, I can respect that
That's like me and you hitting a lick, you shoot me in my back
You fucking with the wrong nigga, I'm telling you

You might feel I'm over due, well come and get me
I keep my heater on me, burn a nigga crispy, make him history

Second verse is worse than the first, your people
Need a corner rebirth, and order a box of white t-shirts
I'ma knock your ass off, I ain't the last Don
I'm the last Dog, one in the manger was under the Nolia
Nigga never could take over Magnolia, Slim here to stay
Nigga know why I smash, anything that's in my way
Hate I'm set tripping, you in ways round my way
If you once, you should know how I handle a AK
Respect me, live by the trigga die by it
Every nigga from New Orleans, keep a gat up on they side
Stay the fuck from round my Bentley, yeah I use to get high
Your bitch told me you say that, after I nutted in her eye
Big girls don't cry, here's a towel wipe your face
Let him know and know he a rat, and he got fucked up stay
Only thing you could do, is suck a nigga dick
Us cut throat niggas, keep another nigga bitch

[Chorus: x2]

You see, this shit ain't nothing to me
If it wasn't for this, I'd be still in the street
Fuck I'm talking bout, stuck in the street 24-7
Pulled up on the AVE., nigga sold me a Mack 11
That's a throwback gat, gotta stamp that there
Give him dollas, and he can have that there
Make sho it ain't broke, and nothing wrong with the pin
I walked on back, and let ten off in the wind
Dog this ain't fully, he done filed it down
Soldier haters please, just hate me now
I'm Jump-Sly Slim, don't jock my style
You want to be like me, but you don't know how
The first thang be original, cause if

Souljahz,"I'ma start with the definition of real hip hop and true raps expression
Inner soul and beliefs through 4 A dat's
Or should I say 32 tracks of inner artifacts
From the heart the pressure just might arrest my cardiac

And perhaps it snaps some back if I don't cut it some slack
Release the spirit that be spittin' these lyrics, you can't react
There is no come back for those who come wack
Leave you shook with a hook from the Holy book for combat

Now what? You wanna battle me? It's ain't what it seems
You ain't up against the odds of me
You up against the odds of the Most High
Supreme Being

You took a turn for the worst and got cursed
You mess with a child of Jah
You deal with God first
'Round the earth and sea

Never fake or underestimate the power of the enemy
'Cause just when you think you got the devil out your vicinity
He snipes you from the roof and takes you out like he did Kennedy
And splatter your dreams all over the wall, laugh as you fall

Cut you off in the knees and make it hard to stand tall
And in the midst of it all, he got the gall to say no hope
So to cope you call a psychic and review your horoscope
You know what I call a horoscope? Exactly what it means
A scope into the horror of reality's bad dreams

They make it out to be
What it doesn't seem
Just to change it back to way it is
Nothing' but lies, kid

Where all my hip hop Souljahz at?

Now just throw your hands way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
And if you're here to get down
Lemme hear ya say, aw, yeah
(Aw, yeah)

You be feelin' it deep in your soul
Tryna' deny that yo peachy world done lost control
We live and die in the dust that we came from
No matter where everybody sing the same song

We all brothers and when you hear the missiles soar
You hit the floor like war, war, still can't find out what it's good for
Absolutely nothin', we killin' like we cannibals
Runnin' over somethin'

You life's a never ending story, runnin' from the nothin'
Don't say I didn't warm you when you see it comin'
Hell fire, brimstone, takin' you home
Came from dust, went to flesh tone and now you gone

Back to dust so in God we trust, get on the bus
Before you leave here, you never know when your time is up
Like the night your clock strikes 12, you lost your shoe
Or the carriage took your shirt to hell, what you gon' do now?

And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
And if you're here to get down
Lemme hear ya say, aw, yeah
(Aw, yeah)

Walked in the door, I asked you before
What you here for? And you shook to the core
Walked on the floor like it was a chore
And then you asked, Lord can you bless me times 4?

Na, na, na, I can't handle it
If your gonna rock, man, please bring in the gentle
Can tell by your sentiment that you weren't even feelin' it
But then, oh but I didn't it

1, 2, look out for my crew
'Cause we be rockin like and nobody knew
From our heads to our shoes, gotta keep it true
Gotta keep it righteous to Him our praise is due

To the ticktock, Souljahz don't stop
'Cause we, 'cause we bring that real hip hop
And we got the stuff to make ya head nod
And make ya, make ya body rock

Souljahz,"Why do you hit me?
You know I ain't your punchin' bag
Since when do thorns try to hurt the roses?
And why are you always mad?

Said I, I'm so innocent, and you're, you're so ignorant
Raise your fist, hit or miss
Try to take my happiness
Well, that ain't happenin' to me no more

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today, yeah
Said I know I'm gonna make it today

I woke up this mornin'
As I wiped the sleep from my eyes
Got a real good feelin', yeah
For the first time I had no reason to cry

So I said, ""My Father
Lord, thanks for the changin' my life
Lord, thanks for holdin' me, showin' me
What real love is like""

'Cause you're so true to me
So I try, try to be true to you
You love me when no one, no one even cared for me
So I can face the rain and smile again

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today, yeah
Said I know I'm gonna make it today

What's the bottle for, and why are you so mad?
I thought that mama said you're supposed to be our loving dad
But alcohol done took control of your life
Now you do the same and try to take control of your wife and kids
So I'ma speak for all the quiet and scared
Too afraid to stand 'cause they can't face their fears

Take a look in the mirror, MJ says, ""Change your ways to see clearer""
God says, ""There's always a way out
Ain't no temptation that ain't played out""
Since the beginnin' of time, Satan's been roamin' the earth
Trying to tempt the weak willed to hate and hurt

And since sins birth, I know your lives been hard
Need to stop beatin' us and start beatin' your problems
So today is when we stop the hurt
Get up, it's 10 o'clock, yo, we're goin' to church

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today, yeah
Said I know I'm gonna make

'Cause I, I, I found a loving father and I, I, I'm fly away
To a place where I can smile and cry
'Cause I know I'm gonna make it today
I know I'm gonna make it today

Souljahz,"We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

'Things ain't always what it seems', Martin Luther King
Said it and while you hate you regret it
But the world will never change until you openly admit it
And look, [unverified] at the color of my sin and then you'll get it

Yo, what about the great American dream
Where all men are created equal
Was that a twisted plot for the sequel?
Sewing seeds of hate so that your kids inherit evil

And the wonder why your peachy
Neighborhood isn't so peaceful, ooh, let freedom ring
And shake the entire being of America's dream
Let it ring from mountaintops to valley lows

My rally grows stronger with my hunger
For this land of the free, home of the brave
Mentally enslaved, we lost everything that our forefathers gained Pain?
My race still decides it as states we're united and by hate we're divided

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

I ain't the first to paint this picture, reminisce on how my situation
Done got me thinkin' clear, oh my dear, baby
I'm sick of tryin' lately, y'all see me cryin' it's crazy
I thought we made it far from here, oh, oh, oh no
Forgive them Father for they don't know their problem's gone

Deeper than my skin, became king of the hole above their chin
Don't tell me nothin' 'cause I don't wanna hear it
God judges through your spirit, don't let your hate
See my color and dig my grave again

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

Many have died, their very lives a living sacrifice
But they all remembered, they all remembered, yeah, yeah
Instead of walkin' let's march, instead of words, let's speak heart
Who needs the sunlight, when freedom reigns?

Yo, she was such a dignified child
It been a long while since she seen a stranger smile
Just moved to New York and they all hate her 'cause she can dance
Who ever said, havin' rhythm means you gotta be tan

She was taught to be color blind but her ears could hear
And every time they talked about her, her heart shed a tear
Come on, y'all don't hear me what else can I say
Listen let me tell you in a different way

We fight, betray, we know the games we play
And I can't figure out the reason why tell me why, it kills me
We say we're grown but yet fight over skin tone
Instead of helping each other we'd rather help are own

We all talk, we all walk, we all do the things we want
We're so powerful we say, so why can't we stop the hate
So come on, tell me how to get to the place
Where all the color lines fade away

Souljahz,"You don't know me, look into my eyes
You don't trust me, you'd rather die
Then to take my hand, lead me from this land
Of destruction and poverty, why don't you understand?

You don't see me, look into my soul
Can't believe me, I have nothing to show
But my legs and my arms and my feet and my ears
And my eyes and my hands, can't you see, I'm a man?

I am the poor man on the street and to the rich man
I'm a sinner, I'm a beggar and I'm a freak
Everyday you all just pass me by, can't you see me?
Please don't deny that I'm alive

Aye, yo, I roam all day and night alone
This cold pavement is my home away from home
Where I spend it, don't matter none
'Cause I'm left stranded but not the only one

'Cause there's a whole community of them
And me's that you stare at like we are the enemy and I swear
I don't mean no harm, I just wanna walk with ya
Don't mean no harm, I just wanna talk with ya

Tell me your name, I'll tell you mine
How you doin' today sir, I'm doin' fine
Now tell me, how that seem so hard
Easy to forget about me, when you forgot about God

So now I lay me down to sleep
I pray, dear God my soul You keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray, dear Lord my soul You take, You take

I am the poor man on the street and to the rich man
I'm a sinner, I'm a beggar and I'm a freak
Everyday you all just pass me by, can't you see me?
Please don't deny that I'm alive

Listen, it's a hard road and it's a hard game
To live the life of the man that has no name
And you point your fingers and laugh
Did you ever think where this man takes a bath?

Did you ever think when you called him a slob?
That it might be you in a year with no job
Yeah, he was livin' day to day a normal life just like yours
A job, house and a normal wife, just like yours

But never did he think or comprehend what was ahead
His stock dropped to zero, now he's better off dead
Then goes the house, back accounts and the Benz
Just when he needed 'em them the most, there goes his friends

Suicidal thoughts as the countdown begins
Puts the nine to his head it all comes to an end
About to pull the trigger as he takes his last breath
He remembers when he dies his kids inherit his debt

There's nothin' left, nowhere to run,
Puts down the gun, puts out his hand
Begs you for a dollar and you deny him again
Look him in the eye and deny him again, his name is poor man

You say you love God, but God says feed him and He'll feed me
So why deny me of the very thing I need
Don't want your money, no, at least have the decency
To look me in the eyes and not deny that I'm alive

He is the poor man on the street and to the rich man
He's a sinner, he's a beggar and he's a freak
Everyday you all just pass him by, can't you see him?
Please don't deny that he's alive

Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive
Please don't deny that he's alive

With no excuses for my shame
In a world that measures our success
By where we're at but not how we got there
I think we're sinking deeper everyday

If I had a dime for every tabloid mocking His return
I would be a millionaire, oh, and still they'd never learn
Use this fool to shame the wise
Remove the pride that blinds their eyes
Be my sail so I can drift way, oh Lord

But if my Father's the light than I inherit brightness
We all people, black, white or brown we all equal
Livin' the same world waiting for the sequel

I write what my heart speaks through my pen leaks
Lyrics that are obstacles to make us reach peaks
Like women, never put no man in place of God
'Cause then you're sinnin'
And you know how hard it is for us to repent, I've been sent
To tell y'all just exactly what God meant when he quoted scripture
Write it down take a picture, so you could take it witcha
And let my lyrics change you when they hitcha, yeah

Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game

Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

The thing that I do would only take a king to peruse
Never flirtin' with the physical only my mind and mental
This world, an instrumental, my life became the pencil
The paper is the days that gone by
I write with inspiration, with love for every nation
Yes, the hypnotic, Portuguese, Neurotic
From a land where they understand a man is symbolic
The soul's really what controls where everybody started

And where everybody's going to and up
Got lost in the dark because you didn't care enough
About the light, a vision that persuades me to write
A vision that persuades me to keep it shining
Bright for the Lord
Never go no where without my sword
This train could leave at anytime y'all better all aboard
Whether livin' day to day, or livin' heart to heart beat
A true Souljah suffers agony but never sees defeat

Why we always get caught up playin' that same ol' game
Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game
All aboard the train, we're leavin' tonight
Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

A yo, we all roll the dice in the game of life
Father forgive me for my sins even when I did 'em twice
Even when I did 'em 3 times, the 4th and the 5th
Never through I'd be the one you'd blessed with the gift
And I'm overwhelmed by it, but I must admit
That every time I grab the mic I never hesitate to spit
And if you wanna test God then do it
I'm just gonna warn you son, I been through it
And to my fine ladies, how you doin'?
Open your eyes and your mind what you doin'?

Give it up at such a young age, why you ruin your life?
All you wanted to be was a wife and blew it
And now you stuck with, three children, baby bottles and
Strollers too, and never thought
Dirty diapers would smell the way they do
And high school was cool
Until you got played for the fool tryin' to study for class
With a screamin', baby, burpin' up all over you

Why we always get caught up playin' that same ol' game
Still playin' that same ol' game, still playin' that same ol' game
All aboard the train, we're leavin' tonight
Gonna set things straight, gonna make everything alright, yeah

Sit back and relax 'cause we got more in store for why'all
So listen up and listen good

We gotta praise God through our whole neighborhood
I should slow it down, so you can understand
What this flow is all about

And we can break down these sounds and take time to meditate
On the word of God so your wisdom can escalate
When you gonna put your foot down, take a note now
Acceptin' God is your only hope now

Reach down, deep down in your heart
You talk the talk but do you walk the walk'
You say you love God but do you really love God'
Will you still love God when situations get hard'
Or will you walk away, or will you get down and pray
And worship the Lord almighty like we'

Workin' on really servin' Him in praise
(Worship)
Workin' on really servin' Him in praise
(Worship)
Workin' on really servin' Him in praise
(Worship, worship, worship)
Workin' on really servin' Him in praise

(Worship)
The Lord almighty
Ain't it odd people take God so lightly, check it
Satan is waitin' to fight me and you might say
That I'm dumb for walkin' away, I chose the right way

Despite the obstacles that stand
In my way don't play praise God with two hands
Lift 'em up to the sky, head to the ground
Every knee will bow down, to Jesus don't play around

And if you say you found God then prove it
Profess it with yo tongue you gotta mouth, son use it
Jesus is the name above all names
Forget a famous superstar, God possess all fame

He posses all thing around me, around me
Word, His Holy words neva seize to astound me
And everywhere I look and everywhere I go",Worship

Souls of Mischief,"Yo whassup, this is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement, my ace been
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'mma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?
Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin

Yo,
it's like this and only this,
so I'm go'n tell
Me and my moms in front of the mall, and then I seen this nigga, Ramel
From fifth grade,
I knew this kid was swift
Paid was how his mind logged, so he got his grind on
But now it's years later,
I say ""Hey"" ta him
He flash his fronts fulla AU, and ""Hey you!""
The warning drove from a Seville as it sped by,
Lead fly, ratta-tat-tatta, his blood spatta
I strive ta, see the driva with my eye,
Moms grabbed sky, and caught lead in her thigh, I
Put her behind the trash can, dashed to my man,
It was to late, it's sad that Ramel was perferated
Waited and sweated, for the medics as my moms bled
Even if he was alive at the scene, by now my man Ram's dead
The cops do not care,
'cause our skin has too much shade in it'
They'll dismiss this as some niggas misbehavin'
But I'll never forget the driver of that blue Seville
And live for the day to bust shots in his grill,
But still, I can't do this alone,
My crew's line, so I slip two dimes into the pay phone. . .

I'll stay home, get some rest, call my girl an'
Tajai's on the phone, talkin' about the world's end
What happened?
Ya moms got capped an' ya nigga's dead?
Ya talkin' about paybacks, and bullets in the head?
Well 'um, hoodz come in dozens, but I got a cousin,
That live around the block, an' they got a glock,
an' we can swiftly bust 'em
I trust 'em,
wit my life, an' plus the glock is light, an'
Easily concealed, easy it'll peel a cap right
Hey Tajai, don't stop, rap too tight (?????)

Maintain composure, hit the dosia,
Pick uh booga,
don't be shook up, I got hook up
Look up my ManiPhesto, I need the special,
Teams for the schemes, get A-Plus so he can brings
The blueprints,
to the residence,
the measurements and features
We're gonna cause explosions wit Clorox Bleach an'(Boom!)

Tap their phones, watch their every move with a telescope
Peep their favorite spots, inventing plots for their demise
On the DL, make sure, to the crimes, we have no ties

PHESTO:

Around about noon I got a buzz on my ringa (Ring)
What a humdinga, what happened to Tajai's mom?
Uh gonna was some kid named Ramel
My mission was to flip the aparrel, escaping by my coattails
An' from Thrifty,
swiftly lift the ping pong balls in hand
I ran where I was most suspected to be founded
Bounded up my pals and snuffed the ruffnecks who buck tips
Hollow and follow and trace every single face
Then deface them anyway we could

HIV needles might be feeble, but
We was not wit the consequences being much worse

Ten o'clock, on the dot, meet around the block
From his crib, we can get this kid shot, plus I got
His sister on my tip, she says she's ready to try us
Let's get her, an' break off all her fingers wit some pliers(Nah, that's
ill)
Anyway, Tajai, jet around to the back, an'
Be strapped, since it was ya moms you should gat that
Criminal,
shoot him in his kneecaps first
Don't waste no time, you see that grill, remember we blast first
Opio and Phesto, let's go get the south window exits
In your nexxus(???) is the moment we should flex, it's
definitely on, I bust one to the front
We got the exits covered, there's no way that he can run
The stupid nigga ran to the back like I expected

Death is what he got, yo he shot, an he started all the cappin'
But now he knows: Anything Can Happen!",Anything Can Happen

When niggaz say I can't rhyme I recline
I'm the first to tell you, I got G's in my verse who tell me
It hurts a fella when I rip, because I'm sly slick
The nigga fly chicks ride dick with me
I'm leaving niggaz stranded man that's how I planned it
Landed blows with my random flows
And it goes -- a little something like this
And I might diss, with my right fist I strike kids like a pitcher do
I split your bitch you better switch or I twist ya
I play tricks like a mix
When booty niggaz miss the beat
I figure that they wack I go and get my bat and a pack of Swisher sweets

Who the fattest?  {Hiero}  It's batting practice

It's no feat, how I defeat, weaker
individuals set em up like give and go

Beseech ya, proving I'll do that too
'cause when you, pulls my clothes on and shrouded
I'm out with ya grip and you're pimpin so how did he
do that shit, who dat kid, you're asking the masked man
Who fly higher than NASA
Ask friends what you need when I need your blockin
Then I leave you knocked in
Counts to call I scrubs em all
With the quickness, using fitness, leave you fitless
Who got a problem with me ripping all than I do
I'm batting way more than you
Hey sure you knew my rhymes was fly
My lines imply that I'm fatter, next batter

Get the fuck out, I never struck out
Better get the bucks out, and kick em down

That could mean a loss of consciousness when I launches this
Back to the scene of the crime I'm never on sight
Untouchable, what you pulled another hiest?
Precisely, I's be the man that did it
Said it, free up your possession never regretted
No anthistetic so you're headed for some suffering
Bufferin can't ease the aches and pains of my-grains
When I trail this drain on your lifestyle
Pull a knife while, you give it up, simp
I'm a pimp got your hoe and got your dough

I'm worse, than the baddest bat crack

It's Phesto so get your cash flow, I crushed em
It's gone, right before your eyes, if you're wise
Another hiest done nice when I slice
your neck and snatch a duffle-bag with a sag
and a tag in your crew, dag how you do
Dangerous if it's your brain I bust they taking
chains and stuff, from the victim eyes is surprised
And I'm quick to size men, up with a swing to your grill
What I planned difficult that's split your skull
with a tool, if you ever fool, with us all
Did you ever think, if you blinked
I wouldn't get you for your links, and your cash and your minks
Savage enough to keep my average up
Puttin chumps in assume a new marking then I'm scots-free
Watch me, duck into the night with your valuables
I'm getting down with my tools

I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I harm the shit, but see next this keen text
be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm

At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, cause it makes me think of more shit to kick

I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
'cause I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill, the noise, my boys, never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

[A-Plus]

My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
satanic messages I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles, I wipe smiles
and smirks off of jerks 'cause that weak shit don't never work
Niggaz is WACK as fuck your over
Get your life together, find some direction cluck nigga
I got the titanium steel verse, slicin through
With some shit that you'll never ever do

It's over me, I am enough to rip it flat, and pass

Chosen hand busted from the tussle from the mic which I ignite 
Like a pyromaniac don't play me that's 
Not recommended you're winded your girl lays me back 
And I attack the twat viciously 
Got it twitchin' she's a bitch to the dopefiend beat 
Hope we meet in the next lifetime 
For the strife I'm, the nigga with the better rhyme 
Hoes think I'm adorable, MC's think I'm oracle 
Foolish mortal, I got the flows so call your crew 
And crush the earth's crust because I bust 
Thunderous, I'm breakin' niggaz down to dust 
The rhyme sorceror forces you to shout my praises 
Phenomenal phrases hit you like exploding razors 

Now who put the West up on the map? 
Perhaps you should run laps, you're wack with a stack of dumb raps 
Thumbtacks mark your headquarters 
You're dead when I slaughter, and now your head's leaking red water 
You shoulda been a donor, I'm prone to bone ya hoe 
Though she know I can flow, 'cause I showed her 
And now she's up on my shit, I'm slick 
I rhyme quick, and I'm the shit, dick

Foul, if you think I'm flippin' on the man with the skills 
Niggaz get the dills, still

I pound the lights 'cause they haven't found the light 
But I never taught ya discipline, feel my fist again

You made the proper preperations, I still ate ya 
I hate ya, I rate the 
Mindstate of niggaz that I'm greater, none of that later 
We can do this I wreck blocks like Brutus 
It's not a chore ta, make you come up shorter 
'cause niggaz know I'm sure to serve without takin no orders 
So here's a tip from the hip to your dips 
Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips 
I'll do you swell, I got better aim than Willie Tell 
I rung so let me ring your bell 
DING-DONG! My sing song swells like a Samolian 
Stuck in my pocket, I simply rock it

Peace to the niggaz who got my back and 
Everyone else can get the dills

You rag and boast about your coast but it really don't phase me 
You're style's lazy, you must be drinkin that Crazy

Of countless knit-wits

With mis hits

Homin' devices that are precise as they get, kids
Target's stuck to foes who pose muchly

Punks, we often cross
When soft men

Adam is the man that got more honies than a hive of
Bees I skeeze I'm pullin stunts like mcgyver
And I try ta, always be patient with a miss
But I diss, 'cause groupies always seem to make me pissed
Huh, they gotta be frontin, wantin to start a phony friendship
I never pretend to think I befriend be them hips
And send dips, back to they moms with a grin
But if she's a boo boo head I tell no-one that I got in

Yo, skins friends I got a lotta, and I gotta
Bend them and then blend all the hottie
Spurts be burstin like a mile a minute
'cause I can either take it slow or yo I wild up in it
I'm pulling, yes 'cause fully dressed or threadbare they're nice
I twist my sides to tickle thighs when my head's there
I now rips sets so foul dips spread my rep
I sew the girls up like schweppes, so many kids might fret

Afterwards I'm bouncing dips like tits on chicks
Who be running track, then they be running back for more
Rest assured, it's absurd for her to be your linga
I get the finger, 'cause she can't get the stinga
Any longer, my dong can stretch and I'm stronger
I got the daddy ding-a-ling to get you hot and bothered
Get the kinks out when my stink in the pink shout and scream
Butta second fling is but a dream

From day one I played hoes in the schoolyard, my tool heartless
But not for dips submerging it ain't hurt men to merge in
My status, from baddest to tims I'm pulling more hips
Than gravity, and after the skins get hit, I'm drowsing
Arousing the next dousing the next thousand my saliva
The liver ones 'cause I don't try to run in no dumb females
Some be swell, but, my picks so why tricks
Get restricted to flicks with boo boo heads, I screw you dead

That's insane, I just be in and bang, get boots
For gosh sakes, that broad shakes, her thang to the whole game
The way the labia lips hang it's a sad shame
Clapping when you're tapping, just hit the scraps and be at em
The breasts sag like they're saddened
The skins are wrinkled, dry, worn and battered
Leave em shattered, she's as fly as a maggot

The him I am, the man I'm him
Bustin skins out, I been stout erect checkin dips
When I'm wreckin lips and clitorises, hit her with this
swinging from my you-know-what's so you know butt cheeks
Are clapping tapping the guts on the late with your date
Makes my ego [ha-hah] read those lipstick marks on my penal tip
They don't lie, penis took your dip to a fly despise
My description, why, when I'm making them lips bend

I hit it, I did it, I admit it
I never quit it, yes I knock the boots like I was riddick
Bowe, get with it, hoe, I get with
No, boomerang broads with nasty toes
Keep your corns on your husk you muskrat
But if she's fly, I try to bust that
Glutinous maxims, I wax and bust
I'm taxin just to be the mack man plus

Once I been with women, friendship done been the sole outcome
How come skins can't work their way in? 
The question resting late night at her pad and
Scheming to grab and season, 'cause she's in
I fiend getting mad horny, transforming charges
Into swinging me, seemingly hard miss
Let her know that I was on it
Now I got dibs on that crib I'm +welcome back+ 'cause I caught her

Ponder on this, I swallowed the spliff with elocution
Encompassing the pompous means when I escalate my tool
shins get split, men get spindled swiveled pivoted
by my riveting centrifuge
I swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knife splits
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin the brittle
and flimsy with my whimsy

Terrorize em paralyze em paraplegic, when I leave em

So get the beaner butter we discovered treasure
You're sweet when I stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
'cause I write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
The best from the West 'cause I'm fresh and you're rotten
Take out the trash or I'll take it out your ass
With a blast from the past in the future, I'll shoot ya
But for the present beatdowns will suffice
Lose 'cause you choose to be down with some mice
You dumb dunces I come once it's my time to

Don't you wish I won't dismiss your treachery
I bet you be, leaving upon a stretcher G

Step outside and settle this I cause catastrophes

Demolishing, you and your following I'm swallowing

wack flows who chose to oppose
I don't suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
Reverses the process, god bless you swing and whoa it's you!

Keep evildoers outside with fences

No remorse for, preluckin MC's 

I couldn't be cut with, the keenest of blades 

Holstering the limits of pressing in it, projecting my image 

like a hologram, reanimatin MC's 

Shamrock deceased, base Phes jus dissipated the rest 

A waiting antihistamine is distressed and jaded

",Come Anew
Souls of Mischief,"Verse One: Phesto

Redirect your motivation, while we collect the dough forsaken
Making a mockery of you MC's, we grimace malicious parodies
you're finished, allowing you to win is just not in us
that's horrendous just replenish apprentice retract all
the wack 'fore you niggaz get blackballed, you're small
And we make a spectacle of y'all withdrawal
Punk contention bitten for attention
Souls of Mischief your worst, enemies, your energy's
wasted, disintegrated, you'll be incinerated
by the innovative when I'm stimulated come pale
To embellish I relish MC's overzealous who fail us
Time will tell us, emulating recreation is colorless
Frontin like they on some other shit
Developing discover this irrelevant to wack intact exact
Well I belittle MC's, and hold no reefer
But sho don't sleep I'm out

Verse Two: Tajai

We the fruits of rotten seeds, nowadays it's bout greed
That's the policy, get from me, so I grab all I see
And after that we out, in a trail of laughter
raps and doubtless claims of standards upheld and maintained
This ain't no, flash in the pan shit, just sell it and fade to nada
Or dance hits to propel, a major knot up in my billfold
One day I got up and I willed no rapper greater
They fake and still doze and act like they young as fuck
Hollerin about the niggaz they buck
Fallin out the windows made up like hoes if they get bucked
Lesson utmost, japanitos to one broke
who have an ego, or fade you like vita largo
Damn where did he go?  Sucker felt the evil I know, word
Casino, I ant that ass like zebra skins
Fidos keepin pins and needles
Whether you tread or rest your head until ya
Succumb to the voice that's deep within, you should know

Chorus:

It's time to let the weak shit go, no more
And if you with us, hoe hoe!!!
You should know, it's time to let that wack shit go, no more
And if you with us, hoe hoe!!!

Verse Three: Opio

They say I'm too posessive, aggressive
I make a mess of MC's depress em, plessin em
The West eclipse the rest, suggestions, to the ones in my profession
Testin, congestin, the mic doin impressions
Souls of Mischief make em all fall in succession
If you're pressin luck self destruct
I'm vindictive, so descriptive
Intriguing on the mic, we don't see things alike
I strike at breakneck speeds and leave you think twice
'fore I sink ice cold lyrics and you're sliced
through the mirror and it's right to the center
where it hurts, convert
Reconsider the bitter, consequences
You're defenseless against us, you go berzerk
Ingesting MC's like clockwork, when I rock
murderous rhymes one time for your mind
And drop dimes for them niggaz who don't get live

Verse Four: A-Plus

I reduce you to dust piles
Plus styles'll crush smiles, seducing women til they bust out
of they garments, always give the crowd what they wanted
I rock the mic and now, they don't want you on it
So I own it, I make my grip tight
It's like I'm nuttin nice when I'm writing rhymes to cut and slice men
You wouldn't, I win every time that we clash
I will surpass ya, A-Plus a known flasher
Rhyme if you want to, it makes no difference
cause you still gonna die, youse a goner
You shouldn't even try, why was you on the
mic in the first place
You even chose tbe track, see yousa nigga with the worst taste
I make you niggaz disperse with haste
My tape first with bass hurts your face we curse the fates
I think that I should be your human idol
Makin MC's suicidal when they lose they title

Chorus: repeat 2X

First of all, for you pussies
don't take it personal
SOM is versatile

I never submerge this style
I break em down (?)
while you were still trapped in trial and error
catchin block (?) like a cold
soundin' like the next nigga on the microphone
we ain't stole

prepare to spit
so don't experiment
you won't know where I went
shiftin all directions
and attempt to escape
but wait the connections sensin
aware of what terrors lurk
so I'd be alert
assess the damage, after I kick a verse
it hurts... stoppin rappers dead in their tracks on wax
I cannot be broken down on fractions
the fantastic four... attach
words together like a latch
or a clasp when we pass the mic

I avoid it.
Like being exploited.
Couldn't leave my people disappointed.

Nothing's inconcievable.
Anything is possible.

Will it be...

Huh?
Two to the head?
Huh?
Maybe HIV so i can join the ranks of the living dead.
But, hey Tajai gotta press on.
I'm late for class

I could buss my gat,
Cook some crack,
Master calculus,
Build houses,
And make a stack.
Either wayI
Depending on the dues i pay.
No, you can't go,

Opio:

If you're with me then you're all about making money.
So throw your hands in the air 'cause ain't shit for free.
Nigga, Oakland California is the place to be.
It gets hectic see.
I just connect to free
My mind
And write rhymes,
So I don't get caught up
Or get shot up.
Plus the fuzz think I got the product??
I don't cut lines, I don't have to.
But if you look like a playa, they harass you.
I make cash from doing shows from state to state.
But still task on the run that license his plate.
I don't trip 'cause it's all in vain.
Your daughter knows my name.
Ask the broad the game.

A-Plus:

People applaude the Famous
Never lame.
Just rhyming to your brain, buss.
You're acting and that's a shame.
'cause I set examples say in 9-tre.
It's not a little joke.
I gots to rhyme a little more,
So I'm fin ta go
And scoop a forty-o.
I'm under 21, but then my sack is known as so.
To the show we go
Place a big stoge on the bridge, 8-0.
A club with foes and hoes.
I want high class bitches
With the ass that switches.
When I get them, they be due soon as the Ad. is finished.
Make me me feel like I'm living on the wrong planet.
Strong as granite. 
It's the Souls with the song that's demanded.

Attract the knowledge changed.
To get you far in this game.

Women are so conniving
But they liven me up
Inviting
Succulent breasts
Bustin' through that dress
Impress me and shes
Hold up turn around so we can see the rest
Yes
What a dame
A mothaphukkin' shame
What's ya name
You look fantastic
She responded enthusiastic
Was it the fame
They all the same
What's the difference in this plastic
No drastic measures
Just for pleasure, laughs, kicks
Conversation was simple
She liked my dimples
Asked me when will I be leaving town
It's goin' down
I said tomorrow
A look of sorrow crossed her face
But I'm an ace
Shot out to the hotel for the satin lace treatment
Victoria's secrets
Get me weak in the knees
Baby please don't tease me
She put the squeeze on me
Had me whipped
A tight grip
The perfect fit I flipped
I couldn't handle it
Shot 'em out but now I want 'em back
Baby doll tell me where the phuk you at. . .

Yeah, now this shit here sounds like some interlusion
So let me kick some lewdness
Slackness
I wish I had a bitch that practiced
Gymnastics
And when I hit it from the back this girl
Would twirl and twist and fat lips
And make the johnson vibrate like a tonsil
Plus on the tonsils
Honeyboo be on the job
And if I try to hang she be like a bat outta' hades
Phuk around get with the nigga my lady
I want a bitch that's
Maybe glaze me in some cherries and heavy syrup
But neva no reigns see and neva no stirrups
None of that s and m
Just undressin' when
It's appropriate and even when it's not
Cause she hot, so ...

[Chorus]

I knew this nigga that was bigga than life
Pullin' the trigga and knives
He'd stick up in ya in fights, and he was
The kind of nigga causin' pain and static
When you seen him he would make you wanna aim your 'matic
But that is not happenin'
That nigga got back
Cause if you shot at him
80 niggas would be on your block cappin'
He had family
Understand me
And he know popo know he make his dough sellin' candy
He got friends in high places
White men in skyscrapers
I bet they help him beat his 5 cases
Untouched a true mack indeed
He'd pull a mac and bleed
He made a stack from crack and weed
He phuckked up the fact is
The nigga tried to duck taxes
Now he at that ah nigga you, punk status
Federal pen with non-hetero men
Climbin' ya front to back
Aw nigga where the phuk ya at

I like them ripe hips
To slide in
After the shows we rock these
I'm captivatin' hoes to wax and they attract me
I see that lookin' in my eyes with fascination
Mesmerized
So I'm buckin' them thighs
For a visit later she replied
Yes
To see her undressed
I just couldn't deny 'cause she possessed
The most voluptuous
Ass and d cups
It was almost too much for just me
I said what's up with us
We got in the cut and let the lust erupt
Scandalous as she did me justice
With them luscious lips
Givin' a nigga rushes
With the slightest touches but bust this
Now I gotta live with the repercussions
Corruption
She raised up when I dazed under the assumption
She could be trusted
Now I'm like what's this
Flustered
Left for broke all 'cause this
Hoe I'll probably never see again
Had a motive and
Got me for my dough
So all I really wanna know
Is bitch ...

Ease off the mic,

is the title they've earned.

I'm comin' from the land of dope,
where all of these niggaz never planned to hope.
You can either be the man to know,
but my plan was writin' hella raw.
Standing quiet cause I be the man ya like,

so I can make a dollar, and make ya holler.
I never fake a scholar
dumpin' rappers in a lake of water.
I proceed to max,

Every girl would be voluptuous
With some D double cups

Say baby won't you take me to your bungalo on the under though
We don't want no one to know how the slumber go
I got a blunt to blow
If you don't smoke then I'll take it facial
Angels done up and blessed you
Baby you somethin' special
Let me undress you
Baby go in your thong
Make me gain some extra weight 'cause somethin' growin' is long for ya
& if your nasty I might even write a song for ya

While you throwin' punchlines
I'm bustin' hot ones with rhymes (blow!)

Swimmin' with sharks I'm off the (Fairline?) Islands
They sense blood in they gills but a nigga will survive man
Automatic darts hypnotic talk
Alive and aware come prepared to collide you'se a dead man walkin'
And I'm the executioner connivin' like Lex Luthor
What they shootin' for?

Man, I make these corny rappers respire
Break'em for their dapper atire

Niggas be actin' like
They be rappin' tight, but they lost
Like in the black of night
Soon to be my sacrifice
Better be wary of the legendary
'cause your spot at the cemetery isn't temporary
Have you shook up like kids who mention Carrie
Or Bloody Mary if you rappin' near me
Positively somethin' gon' happen really

You can't manage

Niggas think I got punched by Rudduck
In the stomach the way I bust from the gut & get
G's by the hundred but
That don't matter (fool)
Cause niggas get millions

Runnin' up in your residences
Runnin' busters for their presidentials
In my sights I won't miss you
Once you gone I won't miss you
Livest nigga be a dead issue
Your flesh is just tissue for my talented talents to rip through
Physical enslaved to my imbalanced mental
My confidence is not confidential
So show deference for my skills diferential

Yeah I suffocate featherweight MC's never resucitate
Decimated easily as my voice fluctuated sentence structure

Blood rushin' display of luxury and immerse ya
Submerge ya beyond the verge of word perfection

Cock'em and cock at their nose
Stopping their comment just for haulin' that garbage

With spontaneous combustion

That's why I cut class everyday it felt like prison
Poppin' at your ex-girlfriend in detention
Tossed her in the library got my duck sick then
The next day I was jalapeno dick pissin'
Raw (that need?) the vixen on a suicide mission
Bad bussiness the pussy had me mystified
Couldn't trust her but I risked my life
Bad business my dog as my witness
Tried to act church girl religious
She had a hit list
Bad business lucky what if syphillis
Or the monster
What you got that all for a boo?

Spendin' all your time wastin' your time
That's bad bidness that's bad bidness

Young buck sixteen, in a state of emergency
Got you thrown in juvenile hall
Cause you toss a marked car it's stupid
Fit out a Lakeshore
But you want to bounce over the hill to thirteen?

Ten dollar genocide is senseless
You want to be a pharmacist?
All you doin' is harming us
What about Paris Robinson

When promises are made that you have to break
Spoken in vain for accolades

When you accept a wrong
Instead of correct a wrong
That shit ain't to be slept upon
That's bad business
When ain't no one in the world

Got my thang on
Did my thug thang
It wasn't a thang wrong

I thought it was just my mic level
I can't hear myself & Plus turn up the echo

I took a five hour plane flight
Spittin' at my homegirl via satellite

Last night!

Idea was top the secret
And you wouldn't belive it unless you peeped it
She was off the chain, all-terrain
All insane alcohol stalled her brain
Last night I caught the right weed
Had my body slow-mo but thoughts at light speed (last night!)
Was a long one I was on one, a strong one
Smoke it 'til it's all done

Last night!

[Opio]
We out we out we out
Forty miles over the speed limit
On target like a bullet to the knees
From the SWAT team when I'm
Shootin' these in 'em
Trigger kamikaze but two shots are hidden then
Step into the station (Pass A-Plea the venom)
So we can take a sip and let the poison get in 'em
Ink off the mic like a vortex without a bitch or a Lex
I get more affection
Payin' no attention cause I learned my lesson
Cold hearted bitterness so I never sweat them (last night!)
Starstruck the Hollywood hoes in action
Master your high watch out they backstabbin'

Chillin' where the city lights flash bright
Burning rubber in a riddle livin' in the fast life
That's right
I saw the last of my ID's
One too many a dem Long Island ice teas
Act right
You thought you was the life of the party
Feelin' light hearted off the lime and Bacardi (last night!)
I seen your girl at a red light
Too conditioned for your highness but we did it all night

Last night!

[Tajai]
Last night I spend my whole night out
Met some hoes outta fest for low riders
Mind hunters, lip gloss shine & hypnotizin' minor men
And like a fool I invite 'em into my ride
When we was already high but with tequila sunrises
Jack & mai tais
It was all over
Wished I stayed sober cause I don't know what
Happened and niggas keep on laughing (last night!)
Oh that's right

Headed for the O with Pep and Jay-Biz

Then I got a call from this girl I hate bro (what?)

Spine to your liver
Flash like a line sniffer I'm swifter
Than Michael Jordan snortin' some speed
And I'll give ya
Much more than you need yo fly nigga
Scorin' the weed sticky green'll make me high quicker
Twistin' it and mixin' it with Bacardi lime liquor
Beligerent kickin' it with (tati on?) the time ticker
You could be a dyin' man with a mic but I'm sicker
You rhyme wack as I bust like Leon Isaac
Makin' peons slide back
That don't be on the right track, we way off
So now they stay soft like impotence
But I say naw, I'd rather stay raw
Magnificent rippin' it
Givin' it all I can though
Plus I handle devious scandals

Luchini like Camp Lo
Wreckin' the beats
Gettin embassy's executive cheese

I'm the loose cannon aid on deck
Detonate in a millisec
Covered in a blackened silloutte
And still reflects enough light
To shatter your body like a pinyata
Bobofet or
Jim Cata doin' lyrical kapoeta
The net to netta
Smokin' purple fibers off the hedges
Till it's resin
And pledge allegiance
To the essence
Confront Phes rock
Ever present with hesitance
My tongue twistin' tornadoes
Never miss your residence
You cackling cacophonies
Me and the mike is holy matrimony
Tackling your phony flow matrix
You couldn't absorb or deflect the impact
With roll cages
The soul aces
Take you to that oasis

Latch onto my concept
In the context of conquest
I capture, your conscience
Move upon you with logic
But it's so deep up in ya
Ain't no way you fittin' to dislodge that
I mean way up in ya
Bend your mind like a fender
How the (bought?) of my new agenda
My deluge of lewd yet shrewd mental food will wet you
And your crew
So eschew from testin' my standard issue
Let alone the cannons and missles for heavy damage aimed at those
Grandstanding with petty anti-antics
Can't match those, handcrafted by my many mechanics
Who's skills run the gamut who will run the planet
Any time I exert my will it's outstandin'
To the point where you gotta hand it or hate and be mad
It don't matter to me
Over a bed of fresh beats its style au natural with no additives

[Opio]
Even if you brandishing guns and break laws
I make you let the pistol go and praise God
A dynamo
Shinin' on the mike like a quasar
They can't infiltrate the steel cage brain star
I'm feelin' blood hounds all on my trail
Like my lyrics was peruvian candy
Not a fugitive
Truly expanding minds with rhymes with the family
Who be gettin' higher than the Andes
The way I plant seeds deep in the underground
Make the thunderous pound to get your heart pumpin'
Spark up the kryptonite
People gettin' lit tonite
Indica-like, to try to simplify try

But I never the one that want to be fuckin' up the fun

We surpass the summit
Stranglin' rhythmic arrangement elements transpose and plummet
I take it back to my roots, vast and infinite
Composition is crafted intricate, jazz I rip it &

Before they can ask for sentiments and flow tear gas your tenements
After I flash the emblem
A symbol of the last millennium
Who the best boy?
Yeah we askin' anyone
Peg your chest and
Crush your velvet, shatter your pelvic
Hard hat or your helmet spin in the cockpit of a plane
And the tail spins
Still my satin smooth
Patented moves raps scat and
Scoop fatten the groove flatten your crew
Could happened to you
Word it's my propensity to cut back
Instantly change direction at my point of attack and leave tracks
Dilapidated, handicapped and incapacitated
When I ex-sling I silk screen these words in your chest

And I do it faster than the grand national & twin turbo

In synchronous increments
Seemingly seamlessly
I'm a semanticist
Prayin' like many a mantis is
Though I'm not meanderin' answerless
Meditation that's my medication
Concentration leads to consternation
And conceptual inception
Interspersed interjections
Incite insurmountable insurrections
In the urban sections
Stretchin' my sharpest weapon
Precise etchin's of life's lessons, scaled and detailed to perfection

I want to be with you now
Can't you hear
In your eyes locked in time is right where I want to stay
Now I understand that it goes both ways
I want to hear you say it
Don't be afraid
We have so much more we don't know where this love could go

Oh what joy I'll bring, oh what joy I'll bring if you let me
Of this joy I sing of this joy I sing won't you let me

I'll lock the groove down

Let me take you on and on

So we can move round

Kisses in the rain

So liberated

Will leave all our baggage behind
Take my hand
Don't leave no road maps

Did nothing for me

So liberated

When logics die
And the place of sadness
I occupy with dignity
Was left like a dream among stones
And the words that you spill
From the mouth that you fill
They abandon their grace and fatigue
Oh, to feel without touching
And speak without talking
You'll spill
The tissues of lies
How I wish we could mend this
Or learn how to throw away
As we look for someone to blame
Love's been denied
Don't be polite
I owe you nothing
When logics die
I'm the orgy and the distant cool
The friend you will never fool
I like the way you oppose me
Let the last thoughtd languish
And try and distinguish
You'll spill the tissues of lies

Or learn how to throw away

Everybody wants to be the dj
Everybody thinks it's oh so easy
You think you belong and you come on strong,
But I can still tell the right from the wrong.
I could never be that kind of girl
Nobody takes the time to turn
You always act as if it's understood,
But sweet revenge is finger-lickin' good
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
'cause I don't know
Here's one thing how to understand me
Loneliness tastes like cotton candy.
You answer ""I love you"" with ""I know"",
Never check the messages on your answerphone
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
'cause I don't know
Temptingly yours
Maybe I'm wrong
But I could've sworn
I saw your eye twitch.
Didn't object,
What did you expect?
Now I have to tell you:
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
You asked what I did,
I did what you asked,
But I couldn't get it
Right from the start
You went for my heart,
Now I have to ask you
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
It was your idea in the first place
And I know it takes two but on certain days
I try not to think of how it would be if....
I don't pretend
To know where it ends
Wish I could care less.
One time I cried more
In 1994
But that doesn't count I guess.
Scream
Like she was scream
I try to hear
What's in my dreams
I gotta fear
I cannot breathe
Please hold me tight
I try to feel
Don't talk so fast
This radioactive she
What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife
She's like a scream to me
I'm not afraid
I cannot help
There's no disguise, no alibies
What do I think
I cannot say
Something about me
Like she was here

What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife

Saturdays have shown us I'm not
The world's most talkative guy
You say it's fine
But I can always try and answer
With amplified anger, and
Then cry inside
Someone please make go home, I'm
The worst at being alone
Just tell me I ought to watch

In some stupid-half way
Please tell me that you love me
But not too loud

How cruel of you to go away
You turn us on and you don't even have the decency to stay
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon

turn around and turn me on and make that sound you do so well 'cause
I'm not dancing I'm just shifting weight
I thought that you could tell
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Talking like a chameleon

SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT
Neon claws and drama queens agree to like the local band
Everyone is smoking filter cigarettes all over again
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon

SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT

But I could've sworn
I saw your eye twitch.
Didn't object,
What did you expect?
Now I have to tell you:
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
You asked what I did,
I did what you asked,
But I couldn't get it
Right from the start
You went for my heart,
Now I have to ask you
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
It was your idea in the first place
And I know it takes two but on certain days
I try not to think of how it would be if....
I don't pretend
To know where it ends

How I wish we could mend things
Or learn how to throw away
As we look for someone to blame

And the dream is a night
But eternal the kiss
But I guess you already knew

The friend you will never fool

Let the last thoughts languish
And try and distinguish

Soulwax,"(featuring Tracy Bonham)
I used to think cupid was a real jerk
A child star, tormented
A faded star of yesterday
Now toothless and jaded
He shoots his arrows wildely with bottles
Scattered across the sky
He trips on clouds
With a face like Keith Richards
I am your voice what you propose
I am your choice your vow to be
Whatever you do I'll agree
Please forgive me my cruel joke
I'm everywhere, partial and entire
I'm on the inside of everything
And on the outside
I'm trembling like a man away from home
But I can't speak my heart
In case they hear me
Now, no one will listen to our song
I used to think cupid was an asshole
The loneliest soul in the universe
And as the wrinkled birdman approached me
I could smell his smouldering cigarette breath
And he looked at me out the corner of his head
And he spoke
So, you ask me why no one stays together anymore
You're never around when I need you
You're never around when I need you

Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?

Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable

That someday it would lead me back to you

Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

Amar de esta forma total es amar de por vida
Ni el agua de los siete mares apaga este fuego
No puedo evitar entregarme a este ardiente deseo

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas

Cierro los ojos pensando si no te tuviera
No habría ni luna ni noches si yo te perdiera
Si acaso naciera otra vez y tuviera esa suerte
Yo solo estaría por ti, por volver a quererte

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón
