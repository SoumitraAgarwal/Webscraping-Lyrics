Romance,"Soy un solitario
Que no tengo amor
Solo triste recuerdos
De un cariño que me dejo
Era mía, era mi amor
Era mía, era mi amor
Si pudiera olvidarla
Y no quiererla mas
He tratado con otra
Pero nada es igual
He tratado con otra
Pero nada es igual

Yo soy un solitario etc
Soy un solitario
Que no tengo amor
Solo triste recuerdos
De un cariño que me dejo

Era mía, era mi amor
Era mía, era mi amor
Era mía, era mi amor
Era mía, mía, mía",Soy Un Solitario
Romance,"Cariño mío
Esta despedida
Me esta matando

Hoy
Con lágrimas en mis ojos
Te digo adiós

No quiero irme
Ni Dios lo sabe
Que me duele tanto

Si
Fuimos muy felices
Pero hoy se termino

Nunca hubiera descubierto
Tu infame engaño
Hoy mi pobre corazón
Esta muriendo

Me voy amándote
No puedo odiarte
A pesar de tanto daño

Siempre te di toda mi vida
Y me entregué por completo
Tu eras la razón de mi existencia
Y hoy apagas mi luz y me quitan tu amor
Nunca espere este dolor que le has hecho a mi corazón
Porque te quiero
Te deseo que seas feliz
Y nunca te hieran como lo has hecho tu

Nunca hubiera descubierto
Tu infame engaño
Hoy mi pobre corazón
Esta muriendo

Me voy amándote
No puedo odiarte
A pesar de tanto daño
Por que siempre te querré",Tu Infame Engaño
Romance,"Tu carita muy triste
Y tus ojos llorosos
Tu mano blanca al viento
Diciéndome adiós
El cabello en tu cara
Y esa triste mirada
He llevado en mi alma
Desde el día que partí

Y tu primera pena cuando tome
Tu mano esa tarde serena
Y el rubor de mejillas, cuando tu
Primer beso, me lo entregaste a mi
No perdí la esperanza de volver a
Estar juntos y primero Dios mañana
Volveré de mi viaje

Tengo listo el pasaje, para estar
Junto a ti
Este tiempo que estuve lejos
Extrañándote día y noche
Aprendí que sin tu cariño

Yo no puedo vivir
Recordaba tu amor tan blanco
Tu risa, también tu llanto
Mil detalles y tantas cosas
Que yo tengo de ti",Volveré De Mi Viaje
Romance on a Rocketship ,"I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I've been thinking about making you mine tonight
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think your beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I've been thinking about making you mine tonight
Hush your lips
I'm about to speak
If I talk real slow
do you think you can keep up with me
This time
Am I outta line
I'm trying to be a gentlemen
So please don't make me ask again
Yeah I've got a lot of nerve
Coming up to you
But your the only thing that's on my mind
So what's a boy to do?
Let me keep this short and sweet
Your the prettiest thing that I ever did see
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think your beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I'm thinking about making you mine tonight
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I'm thinking about making you mine tonight
Don't let me go
If I'm dangling
High above the world
Where the angels sing
Back it up
Let's turn this train around
Let's get this party hopping
Till we're shaking the ground
When the ground starts shaking
I'll be there to hold you tight
Don't worry about a thing 'cause everything will be alright
Let me keep this short and sweet
There's not a lot I wouldn't do to sweep you off your feet
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I'm thinking about making you mine tonight
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
But I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I've been thinking about making you mine tonight
Don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
Don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
Buy I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I've been thinking about making you mine tonight
I know I'm nothing but skin and bones
but I sure think you're beautiful
With your long long hair
And your big blue eyes
I've been thinking about making you mine tonight",Skin & Bones
Romane,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Romane,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Romane,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon
Romane,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me",La Belle Vie (The Good Life)
Romane Serda,"Toi que j’ai vu brûler
Sur des milliers d’hectares
Toi que j’ai vu cramer
Des millions de boulevards
Toi que j’ai vu cendrer
Des cheveux par milliards

Devrais-je te le dire
Devrais-je en sourire
Depuis quelque temps
Depuis exactement
Que le temps perd son temps
Je te cherche
Je te trouve
Te trouve en chloroforme
En chloroforme

Toi que j’ai vu traîner
Sur des milliers de pores
Toi que j’ai vu errer
En quête des quais des ports
Toi que j’ai vu signer
Des impacts avec la mort

Devrais-je te le dire
Devrais-je en sourire
Depuis quelque temps
Depuis exactement
Que le temps perd son temps
Je te cherche
Je te trouve
Te trouve en chloroforme

Dans nos conversations
Un mot revient

Revient de loin

Toutes ces étapes
C’est la vie fatale

Romane Serda,"Dans mon carnet de velours
J’ai collé quelques images
Découpées avec amour
Dans des livres d’enfant sage

Petite fille d’autrefois
Sur une jolie balançoire
Une biche dans les bois
Une plage vers le soir

Dans mon carnet de velours
Quelques cartes postales usées
La Toscane au petit jour
Et le Nil en février

Souvenirs de beaux voyages
Avec toi mon bel amour
Ainsi au fil des pages
Je retrouve les beaux jours
Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie

Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie

Dans mon carnet de velours
Il y a ces fleurs fanées
Les restes d’un vieux bouquet
Que tu m’avais envoyé

Il y a la photo du Che
Et la plume d’un oiseau
De jolis timbres étrangers
Et de ta main quelques mots
Dans mon carnet de velours
J’ai écrit quelques poèmes
Que je t’ai toujours cachés
Mais qui te disent “je t’aime”

Une lettre de Papa
L’étiquette d’un bon vin
Que tu avais ouvert pour moi
Dans un bistrot athénien

Romane Serda,"En un mot comme en cent
Commençant par cette lettre
Que tu as signée te saignant de ton sang

En un mot qui me dit
Que ce jeudi tu t'en vas
Sur un trésor d'îlot jouer les Vendredi

Où vas-tu, mon envers de moi ?
Là où je ne suis pas, où, dans quel endroit ?
Que va-t-il advenir de mon avenir ?
C'est Venise promise aux flots de soupirs ...

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu gauches et ça vous la gâche
Oh, je tangue, oh, je t'enguirlande
Comme un gosse qui casse et vous agace

D'ici, je vois le tableau,
Doux comme un Douanier Rousseau
Jouant l'ami des âmes et des animaux

Quant à moi, je me vois
Poster des mélancolies
Au destinataire des terres aux mille collines

Où vas-tu, mon envers de moi ?
Là où je n'irai pas, là où tu t'en vas,
Que va-t-il advenir de nos souvenirs ?
C'est Venise en prise aux ailes du désir ...

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu gauches et ça vous la gâche
Oh, je tangue, oh, je t'enguirlande
Comme un gosse qui tient jamais en place
Jamais en place ...

Te souviens-tu de nos partances
Sous des ciels mauves et étranges
On avait aboli la distance
Entre les songes et les anges

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu lâches, et ça vous lâche pas
Moi, dans ce bal, je me balance
Au bout de l'accordéon, je pleure même pas

Je pleure même pas
Je pleure même pas ...",Mon Envers de Moi
Romane Serda,"Sans rivalité elle me donnait la main
Et l’on s’aventurait sous les chênes et les pins
N’imaginant jamais ni le mal ni le bien
Nous goûtions à tout sans penser à demain

Nous rêvions toutes deux dévalant les chemins
Que nous allions trouver les secrets des Indiens
Piétinant dans l’herbe la rosée du matin
Sans penser à nos vies au futur incertain

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passent les jours, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Ainsi s’est écoulée notre si belle enfance
Et nous n’étions guidées que par l’insouciance
Dans ce hameau perdu, ce petit coin de France
Nous vivions dans l’amour et dans l’innocence

Nous étions attachées par un sixième sens
Cette fraternité, cette reconnaissance 
Nous étions réunies par cette ressemblance 
Nous partagions les rires mais aussi les souffrances

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Nos plaisirs n’étaient faits que de tout petits riens
Mon cœur en tremble encore aujourd’hui quand j’y pense

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Passent les jours, passent les heures

Romane Serda,"Tu vois, j’ai vu tout ce qu’un ange a pu voir 
Des torrents de détresse et des ruisseaux d’espoir

Romane Serda,"Fuir la ville impure
Qui n’connaît des saisons
Que cet automne obscur
Qui ne dit pas son nom

Abandonner la course
Retrouver la lenteur
D’une vie simple et douce
Dans ce possible ailleurs

Aller au sud
Voir le ciel aux millions d’étoiles
Illuminer les nuits gitanes
Chercher dans les ruelles d’Arles
L’ombre de Van Gogh ou Cézanne

Aller au sud
Boire à l’eau fraîche des fontaines
Croiser Fanny, Manon des sources
Marcher sur les pierres romaines
Et s’endormir dans la Grande Ourse

Laisser les rues trop grandes
La fureur et le bruit
Retrouver les lavandes
Et leur mauve inouï

Abandonner aussi
Les hauts murs des cités
Renoncer à l’ennui
Aux habits trop foncés

Aller au sud
Écouter le vent qui fredonne
Les mots du poète Mistral
De Nîmes jusqu’à Carcassone
Et accompagnent les cigales

Aller au sud
Pleurer les platanes abattus
Et voir les oliviers sans âge
Dresser leurs troncs noirs et tordus
Dans l’ocre de la terre sauvage

Aller au sud
Aller au sud

Et ne regretter rien 
Ni les gens ni les choses
Tourner la page enfin
De ces années moroses

Esclave des tourments
Dans cette multitude
Où ne règne pourtant
Qu’une vraie solitude

Aller au sud
Vivre de ce soleil encore
Qui coule en moi comme un torrent
Et qui teinte de cuivre et d’or
Ma peau, mes cheveux et mon sang

Aller au sud
Retrouver enfin mon enfance
Dans la moindre pierre des chemins
Et donner à ma vie un sens
À l’éternité un écrin

Aller au sud
Aller au sud",Aller au Sud
Romane Serda,"Le macadam est luisant
Comme une peau de requin
Presque noir
Il est chaud comme un printemps
Sous le soleil qui revient
Dans le soir
Une brume évanescente
Semble monter doucement
Des trottoirs
Ma démarche est hésitante
Les flaques d’eau sont diamants
Ou miroirs

Le déluge a disparu
Sur la ville trépidante
Et sauvage
Il a balayé les rues
Sous les bourrasques violentes
D’un orage
Qui m’a prise au dépourvu
A inondé mes cheveux
Mon corsage
Mes sandales sont foutues
Et que dire de mes yeux
Mon visage

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie
Après la pluie, mon amour
Est-c’que tu voudras toujours
De ma vie
Le ciel redevient limpide
Le silence est revenu
Tout plomber
Et une douceur humide
Embrase les avenues
Désertées
Je marche vers la maison
Où mon parapluie, bien sûr
Oublié
Me dira ma distraction
Se rira de mon allure
Chiffonnée

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie
Après la pluie, mon amour
Est-c’que tu voudras toujours
De ma vie

J’aime ces journées d’avril
Et pour tous nos lendemains
Je voudrais
Déambuler dans la ville
Avec toi, main dans la main
Car jamais
Nous ne craindrons, réunis
Ni le vent ni les ondées

Notre amour est à l’abri
Sous l’ombrelle partagée
Des amants

Tu es le garçon le plus drôle

Que tu n’es pas le plus malin 

Que tu as encore quelques lacunes
Que tu n’sais t’y prendre

Ces silences et ces cris
À dix-sept ans à peine

Dans un essai de philosophie
Toi tu t’évades dans le noir

Moi je chantais Rickie Lee Jones
Et nous avions chacun nos princes

Nous partageons parfois Godard
Mais tu préfères Tarantino

J’aime marcher dans les forêts
Toi tu es fidèle au béton
D’ailleurs tu ne marches jamais
Que de la cuisine au salon

Compte les moutons pour enfin
M’abandonner dans l’inconscience
D’une nuit sans fond et sans fin

Je suis troublée par le silence
De cette maison isolée
Sur une colline en Provence
Où je pensais me reposer
Près de moi je sens ta présence
Toi tu dors comme un bébé
J’envie le sommeil de l’enfance
Qui a oublié de m’emporter

Encore une nuit blanche
À me perdre sans bruit
Encore une nuit blanche
À ressasser ma vie

Prendre un médoc pas trop confiance
Les ai déjà tous essayés
Me méfie de l’accoutumance
Si l’un d’entre eux pouvait marcher
Je sais déjà par expérience
Que j’aurai demain dans les yeux
Un vieux reste de somnolence
Et le blues des matins frileux

Je me lève sans assurance
Mes pas font craquer le parquet
Un verre d’eau pour prendre patience
Va finir de m’éveiller
Je retourne avec nonchalance
M’allonger dans le lit défait
La nuit s’enfuit, le jour avance
Les oiseaux chantent pour me narguer

Encore une nuit blanche
À me perdre sans bruit
Encore une nuit blanche
À ressasser ma vie

Tout compte fait je m’en balance
Dormir c’est mourir un peu
La vie est courte et ma vengeance
Sera de vivre des nuits de feu
J’ai dans la tête des romances
Où nous nous aimons tous les deux

Tu laisses derrière toi la chambre
Blanche et froide comme un suaire
Où l’on a touché à ton ventre

N’a fait ni sermon ni morale
Devait connaître ta douleur

Pleure pas

Criminelle, qui peut le dire
As-tu mis fin à une vie ?
La tienne aurait-elle été pire
Près d’elle

Tu n’aimais guère le papa
Ne l’as connu que quelques jours
Fut-ce un cadeau qu’il te fît là

Sans travail et sans domicile
Qu’une chambre chez tes parents

Tu pleures cet enfant perdu
Qui n’aura jamais de prénom
Envolé aussitôt conçu
C’est con
Trop con

T’es où quand tu dis rien
Est-c’que tu penses à nous
Et à nos lendemains
Est-c’que ton cœur est fou
Toujours autant du mien ?

T’es où quand tu dis rien
Je te connais par cœur
Tu gamberges sans fin
Tu vis avec la peur
De me perdre demain

T’es où quand tu dis rien
Pourquoi je m’imagine
Que tu as du chagrin
Ton bonheur m’illumine

Ne vaudraient vraiment rien ?

Romane Serda,"T’es parti j’avais pas deux ans
Me laissant seule avec Maman
Et son chagrin
T’as préféré ta liberté
Aux douces chaînes d’un foyer
Bien trop serein

Vieux routard, vagabond, volage
Tu ne voulais pas vivre en cage
Alors adieu
Tant pis pour la femme et l’enfant
Tu as suivi les ailes du vent
Vers d’autres cieux

Soixante-huitard invétéré
Espèce de chien sans collier
La solitude
T’a semblé plus douce et plus belle
Que la routine un peu cruelle
Des habitudes

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué
Je me souviens d’avoir pleuré
Bien trop souvent
T’étais pas là, tant pis pour toi
T’as pas connu les premiers pas
De ton enfant

Tu es parti te reconstruire
Un présent et un avenir
Pour toi tout seul
Est-c’que ça t’a rendu meilleur
De ne vivre que pour ton bonheur
Que pour ta gueule

Tu ne m’as laissé que ton nom
Et puis aussi tes yeux marrons
Bien peu de choses
Mais nous n’aurons jamais vraiment
Le même regard sur les gens
Ni sur les choses

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué
Je me souviens d’avoir pleuré
Bien trop souvent
T’étais pas là, tant pis pour toi
T’as pas connu les premiers pas
De ton enfant

Tu oublies mes anniversaires
Ma vie ne t’intéresse guère
Pourtant parfois
J’aimerais bien un mot, un geste
Pour me faire croire qu’il me reste
Un vieux papa

Et si aujourd’hui j’ai trouvé
Des bras forts pour me protéger
J’ai toujours en tête
Le bon vieux temps des balançoires
Où tu ne m’as pas fait m’asseoir
Et je regrette

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué
Je me souviens d’avoir pleuré
Bien trop souvent
T’étais pas là, tant pis pour toi
T’as pas connu les premiers pas

Romane Serda,"Liras-tu cette lettre
Que je t’écris ce soir
Et voudras-tu connaître
Un jour notre histoire

C’est ton papa, peut-être
Qui te la traduira
À douze ans, à dix-sept
Enfin, quand tu voudras

J’y parle de ma vie
Et bien sûr de la tienne
Dans cette belle Asie
Aux frontières lointaines

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

J’ai reçu ta photo
Et j’aime ton prénom
Mon Dieu que tu es beau
Tu as les cheveux bien longs

Apprends-tu à écrire
Comment est ton village
Sais-tu que ton sourire
Me donne le courage

D’affronter les tourments
De ce monde en déroute
Qui laisse des enfants
Sur le bord de la route

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

Moi ma vie est tranquille
J’ai la chance insolente
D’avoir une famille
Attentive, attachante

Privilège suprême
Que, bien sûr, je te souhaite
J’ai un métier que j’aime
Et un toit sur ma tête

J’ai surtout, sache-le
De l’amour à revendre
Alors je t’en donne un peu
N’aie pas peur de le prendre

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

Si le peu que je donne
Te permet de manger
Et d’aller à l’école
Mon bonheur est entier

Un jour, à la Sorbonne
Tu viendras étudier
Je rêve, tu me pardonnes
Mais j’aime tant rêver

Pourvu que ton enfance
Soit une île aux trésors
Je t’embrasse en silence
Je t’écrirai encore

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne",Tu Ne Me Connais Pas

Imma set the mood right yea you know I got it bad

Never mind all that talk you had wit your friends
This isn't the end of the world girl that boys the man
Don't worry about a thing you know I'm gon play it right

And I see us walkin hand-in-hand
Let me be your man and listen to slow jams

[Hook x2: Jojo]

[Verse: Romeo]
I been chasing this paper you know I had that hardest day
So I say lets get it one like Marvin Gay
Ain't no need to procrastinate for this satisfaction
Cause you get it any time like Janet Jackson
We gone be forever girl I give you what you dream
Lets stay together and grind tell smilin
I hear your in desperate need for what I'm packin
So I hope you breath again girl like Tony Praxton
And you know the way I'm feelin is plain to see
Lets take a private plan listen to Tina Marie
Steppin of the jet, be flyin coast to coast
You can be my super star like Luther Van Trost
Its some joy and pain we havin our days
But I never let you down like Frankie Beverly and Mace
And I see us walkin hand-in-hand
Let me be your man and listen to slow jams

[Hook x2: Jojo]

[Verse: Jojo]
See I was all alone I was feelin rather low I needed someone to
Get my spare time so I called you on the phone
To see if you were home but that's when you said

Vean mi nariz, labios pequeños y sobrepeso
Ropa fina escondiendo mis defectos
Pero sus ojos de amor eso no ven
Puedo ser terco antisocial
En ocasiones pero sincero
Buen amante por complacer mi propio ego
Pero sus ojos de amor eso no ven

Y le he roto el corazón más de una vez
Me perdona siempre se rinde a mis pies
Esa es su filosofía amarme es sin medida
Su amor es sordo y ciego

Ella muere por mí
Es un amor casi enfermizo obediente
Excede la normalidad
Y muere por mí
No ve los pliegues ni los fallos
En mi cuerpo soy su todo su verdad

No puede abandonarme
Le he fallado y en instantes me da
Otra oportunidad
Y muere por mí

No tengo nada, pero soy tu rey mami

Yo Rome

Hey mani

Dime a ver de que Formula 2 viene durísimo

Hey Romeo
It’s been a long time
I wanna hear Vol. 2 I heard its fire
Don’t be a stranger

Hey, Romeo Santos
Hey man, It’s Kevin Hart
A.k.a chocolate drop
What’s with this Formula 2 sh*t
I don’t understand
Why you would go with a Formula 2 title
For your album man
There’s so much better stuff out there

Like you supposed to be big
With the spanish community
You know what i’m saying
So you should go with some spanish sh*t man
Like like guava
You know what i’m saying
Or how about tamales, tamales on something
Something else man
Bottom line If you need help
Call your boy
You know i’m huge over there
Spanish woman love me
They call me chocolate drop

Enfermitos incurables

Yo no te dije ni una frase de amor
Y no digo que sea ilógico
Pero esa noche tu cuerpo pidió calor
Sin romance nada bíblico
No te lleve serenata a tu ventana
Ni escribí mil poesías en bachata
Solo te vi, me miraste así
Nos hicimos sentir un ratito feliz

Baby if you like it rough
Give it to me toda la noche
Por favor baby rip me right out of my Dolce

Cuando eras pequeñita y te cantaba una canción
Para dormir
 
Duérmete mi niña, duérmete mi amor
Good night my princess

No es tu culpa enamorarte de un perdido
Los hombres nos disfrazamos por lograr el cometido
Eres presa de leones con maldad
Una joven inocente es muy fácil atacar

El amor es lo más bello y a la vez lo más ilógico mi niña
La vida es así

Por él conoces cigarrillos
Y un par de sustancias que invitó a tu cuerpo
Mi muchachita ahora resulta
Tiene seis tatuajes y un hickey en su cuello

Tu vestimenta esta desnuda
Y un vocabulario que no es muy decente
Pa' mí siempre serás la niña
Y en mi calendario tú nunca creces

Something special

Y un par de sustancias que invitó a tu cuerpo
Mi muchachita ahora resulta
Tiene seis tatuajes y un hickey en su cuello

Y un vocabulario que no es muy decente
Pa' mí siempre serás la niña
Y en mi calendario
Siempre serás la reina de papi

Dedicada a todos los padres
Que pese a la edad que tengan sus hijas
Siempre serán protectores y guardianes

tu, tu come stai stasera ti senti solo vuoi che resti con te? 
Ma sì, parliamo un po', io dormire no proprio no! 
Dai camminiamo insieme per questa strada vuota
E dimmi tutto di te, della tua vita, dai comincia tu

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Sono figlio di questa lunga notte nera e poi
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Vivo in quella strana casa con mio padre e mia madre e ho
Dieci fratelli stessi occhi scuri stessi capelli
Andiamo a caccia di notte come i gatti neri
Ci troviamo sopra I tetti tutti quanti
Sotto una grande luna che

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Che mio padre ogni sera corre fuori a guardare mentre
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Mia madre è lì alla finestra guarda sempre lontano
Quella coda di fuoco quando passa un'aeroplano
passa un'aeroplano
Lei vorrebbe salire, sì, vorrebbe partire poi sparire
Lontano

Sparire lontano
Poi ogni sera resto solo come ogni sera resto solo
Si potrebbe andare al cinema o mangiare un gelato
Poi si blocca, sorride: potessi dargli un bacio, presto dammi un bacio
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Se lui avesse già le orecchie per potermi ascoltare
E una testa in mezzo da accarezzare gli direi
Io, io sono un uomo, tutti mi chiamano 
Faccio mille acrobazie col miop aeroplano
E diecimila volte ho già toccato il cielo
Perchè come un falco io

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Arrivo a tremila metri e poi mi butto giù in picchiata
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ma che emozione ogni volta sfidare la vita
Rotolando nel cielo sopra il mio aeroplano
Ma ogni sera resto solo come stasera sono solo
Cosa dici andiamo al cinema, magari a fare un volo
Ma perchè non sorridi? 
Presto dammi un bacio, presto dammi un bacio",Joe Temerario
Ron,"C’è un momento anche per te
Quando il cielo si colora
Non pensare a niente
Apri le braccia e poi vola
C’è una stella anche per te
Nella sera che sei sola
Lascia tutto com’è
Apri le braccia e poi vola
E vedrai solamente cose belle
Siamo tutti come stelle
Nell’azzurro naturale
E vedrai non ti servirà cambiare
Improvvisamente scoprirai
Che sei bella come sei
Proprio te, te che non ti piaci mai
No non restare più da sola
Dentro al buio di una stanza
Lascia tutto com’è
Apri la porta e poi vola
Ad amare senza avere in cambio niente
Forse amare fa soffrire
Ma è nel gioco naturale
E vedrai come accade facilmente
Improvvisamente scoprirai
Che sei bella come sei
Proprio te, te che non ti piaci mai",Un Momento Anche Per Te

e chiudi dolcemente gli occhi tuoi
vedrai che la tristezza passera'
il resto poi chissa'
verra' domani

Voglio star con te
baciare le tue labbra dirti che
in questo tempo dove tutto passa
dove tutto cambia
noi siamo ancora qua

E non abbiam bisogno di parole
per spiegare quello
che e' nascosto
in fondo al nostro cuore
ma ti sollevero'
tutte le volte che cadrai
e raccogliero' i tuoi fiori
che per strada perderai
e seguiro' il tuo volo
senza interferire mai
perche' quello che voglio
e' stare insieme a te
senza catene
stare insieme a te

dai dai dai...

Vieni piu' vicino
e sciogli i tuoi capelli
amore mio
il sole ti accarezza
ti accarezzo anch'io
e tu sei una rosa rossa

Vieni piu' vicino
accendi questo fuoco amore mio
e bruceranno tutte le paure
adesso lasciati andare

E non abbiam bisogno di parole

Vado a prendere il giornale
Vieni pure se vuoi

Di fiato non ne ho per dirti cosa far

Non mi va di parlare

Ma lasciami stare

Cosa vuole quel cretini
Cosa suona cosa spera di fare
Butta fuori la tua faccia
Voglio proprio vedere
Forse son sbagliato io
Forse hai proprio ragione tu
Non c'è, niente che va male
Sono solo un po' giù
Va bene vado più piano
Ma tu non starmi lontano

Per questa notte che cade giù
Per questa notte da buttare
Mi rimani solo tu

Sulle panchine in piazza grande
Ma quando ho fame di mercanti come me qui non ce n'è

Dormo sull'erba e ho molti amici intorno a me

Dei loro guai dei loro amori tutto so, sbagliati e no

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
A modo mio avrei bisogno di sognare anch'io

Una famiglia vera e propria non ce l'ho
E la mia casa è piazza grande
A chi mi crede prendo amore e amore do, quanto ne ho

Con me di donne generose non ce n'è
Rubo l'amore in piazza grande
E meno male che briganti come me qui non ce n'è

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
Avrei bisogno di pregare dio
Ma la mia vita non la cambierò mai mai
A modo mio quel che sono l'ho voluto io

Ron,"Un giorno di settembre il sole si svegliò
Coi suoi raggi d’oro mi abbracciò
In silenzio pianse di nostalgia
La sua luna era andata via

E adesso dimmi sole cosa posso fare
Sono solo un uomo non so volare
Ma una grande forza mi spinse su
E all’improvviso mi trovai là in mezzo al blu

Guardavo il mondo come… rotondo
Il mare come… bello e profondo
Vedevo la mia casa senza lei
Così provai a gridare forte
Fino a perdere la voce
Ma la luna niente, non c’era più

Provai una grande nostalgia
La mia luna era andata via 
Mentre nel silenzio il sole scompariva
Schiavo di un tramonto

Poi una luce bianca sui miei pensieri
Era la grande luna dagli occhi neri
“piccolo uomo tu non sai quanto ti ho amato
Nelle notti d’estate, d’inverno

Rabbia, amore, pietà, desiderio
Ma tu correvi, correvi dietro al tuo tormento

Adesso sono stanca, voglio riposare
Domani il mio amore potrebbe arrivare
Lo so, il sole e la luna non s’incontrano mai
Ma per una volta solo lo vorrei sfiorare
Guararlo negli occhi: ciao come stai? 
Dirgli: ti amo proprio come fate voi
Che state insieme e poi non vi amate mai
Ma tu piccolo uomo, corri vai da lei",Il Sole E la Luna

Ron,"Ti avevo visto angelo
Cadere in mezzo al traffico
Poi alzarti e piangendo
Con gli occhi guardare in su

Ti ho vista dietro un angolo
Cambiarti in fretta l'abito
E camminare
Ma che fatica non sai dove andare
E sopratutto non voli più

La strada bagnata sembra il cielo
Gli occhi delle case le sue stelle
Notte fonda che mistero
Che malinconia
A forza di guardarti
Sento gia' che sarai mia

Possiamo farci compagnia
Tu senza ali io senza fortuna
Che differenza c'è
Povero angelo povero me

In mezzo a una città che russa
Una città parcheggio
Tra facce sconosciute
Noi camminiamo ci fermiamo
Senza accorgerci arriviamo
Al centro esatto della musica

Ed è una musica che colpisce
Questa musica ti guarisce
Ti riporterà lontano
Per ricominciare il volo
Ma io sto qui e rimango solo
Con una luce che svanisce
Il cuore a pezzi e i suoi pezzi
Nella mano

Povero cuore
Povero e mio
Come vorrei provarci anch'io
A volare
Salire sempre piu su
Volare dentro un angolo
Cambiarmi in fretta l'abito
Ed imparare
Ad non avere tristezza
A non saper dove andare
A salutare e non tornare più

Volare come un'elica di una aeroplano
Poi passare sull'america che
Da qui è così lontano
Conservare un po' di forza
Un po' di fiato
Per volare nella musica
Che ancora nessuno ha mai suonato

E sotto una città che dorme
Una città parcheggio
Senza parole senza coraggio
E allora giù in mezzo al traffico
Per vedere cosa succede
Per scoprir se per un attimo
Qualcuno mi vede

E ancora giù fino a quell'angolo
Con un grosso batticuore
Con gli occhi un po' bagnati
E il cuore al posto del motore

E la tua storia cosi cominciava e quanta neve che ha fatto da allora
Cosa hai sognato ragazzo di strada quando tuo padre un gigante sembrava
E assomigliargli era la tua maniera per ringraziarlo del bene che dava
Accendevi una stella rovente con un ferro la tenevi distante
Imparavi a memoria I tuoi dischi la puntina era di diamante
Ed avevi la barba di grano e ora il grano si è fatto grande

Cuore affamato di carezze di cani
Di amori puliti come quelli dei cretini
Cuore assetato di belle parole
Cuori in alto mare per una frase detta male

Con la tua sciarpa ragazzo di neve e questa nebbia che va fino al fiume
Nella tua testa hai mille parole che si congelano in una canzone
Che cosa hai visto ragazzo di specchio piccole rughe entrate senza permesso
Aprile foglie di amori volare rondine partono per un altro mare
Nelle scarpe o sulle labbra il tuo cuore che hai dato indietro 
Il tuo cuore che era fragile cuore di vetro

Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

It's been a miracle from what you've done

You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

It's been a miracle from what you've done

The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so

My moms taught me not to wear emotions on my sleeves
So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there
Is that you damn

I don't know what else to say man
I feel like I got something
But at the same time I don't
It's lonely out here
You can have all the money in the world
That shit don't matter
You know what I'm saying
When you broke you want money
And when you get money
You just want a girl to lay up with
And chill and relax and shit

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Desperation blows like wind before a hard rain

I know, I know the answer, 'cause I've seen it all before

But still I ask the question 'bout a thousand times or more

I knew that I'd been looking for the wrong thing
I'd see the depths and wonder what I craved
I find a deathless want for something deeper
A love beyond the cradle and the grave

In the soul, the hour of the sunrise
Quieting the voices of the mind
The Cross is there in truth and in Spirit
Turning all the darkness into light

In the wilderness of unbelief
I've wandered like a straying sheep looking for the water

You crucified the Son of Love
He called your work His Father's cup
Risen from among the dead

Caught by a mob with their stones

How many, how many I wonder

Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death

Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.

Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news

Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

Ron Jackson,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Ron Jackson,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms

And now that dream is here beside me

The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew

Ron Kischuk,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Ron McClure,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Ron Raines,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific]
Ron Raines,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Before the sun goes down
You can hear it coming closer
To this dislocated shoulder
of an old and crooked town
That's when the ice cream van rolls around

But in the land of plenty 
The money here is tight
The children here are many
(and if you do have any)
He will park his van outside
There waits the ice cream man with the cold dark eyes 

For it's not a ""Rockwell"" summer
or a world of ""Dick and Jane""
And how it makes you shudder
Like you used to hide from thunder
When you hear him coming down the lane
And you condemn the ice cream man to the world of flame

Raising eyebrows and emotions
He don't phase some people at all
For everyday the circus is open
Everything is alright

Walking with my family, stopping on the way

Pretty little monument beneath a shady tree
For a little boy who died in 1943
But still in the air this lingering grief

There's an old couple on the bus
Sitting next to us, my boy and I
And pointing to the graveyard
My boy turns to the old man
And says ""this is where you go to when you die
My papa told me so""
The old man said ""yes, we know""

Ron Sexsmith,"She was not the girl next door
But the girl from 'round the corner
It was at the tail end of grade four
When she came to school one morning

And all eyes were upon her as she took her seat
Her name was Amanda with pretty eyes of green
And hair of blonde, strawberry blonde
Springtime and dandelions

And summer 'round the corner
Was at the tail end of age nine
With a million dreams before her
She lived with her mother in an old decrepit house

If there was trouble she kept it to herself
All summer long, the strawberry blonde
And by her face there was no way to tell
It seemed like all was well in her world

But the neighbours said 
Her mother had lost her will
To gin and sleeping pills
It was no life for a little girl

Still I see her face framed in blue sky
At the top of a slide coming down
And when the sirens wailed 
(her mother had failed to rise)

All the neighbors stood outside
As Amanda just stared at the ground
Time flies and years are piled
I'd forgotten all about her

When I saw her down the aisle
Of a streetcar with her daughter
Then I heard Amanda say as she got up
""See'mon Samantha, girl, this is our stop""

And they were gone

If we poured ourselves
Like this bottle of wine

It's a thinly veiled disguise

Blowing through my dreams at night
It's tearing me from all that I hold dear
As I hold on for dear life
Through the dark hours we stumble and fall
And fumble around for the light
As far as I can tell, the dark as well

While you're waiting for the love to return to her eyes

Once held in arms so tightly

And I could use a lift
What with all this humid weather 
Something's got to give

As the rain falls on our thirsty love
Thirsty love 

Something's moving in the wounded eyes
And now I feel a chill
Rising through this moody silence 
When you say I love you still
Composure now collapsing
'Neath the weight of all our sighs
As the tears fall from our thirsty eyes

There must be a reason
For the dreams that come and go
Maybe something bigger is pulling on the strings

Ron Sexsmith,"I brought a song into this world
Just a melody with words
It trembles here before my eyes
How can this song survive 

I brought it to the tower of gold
In my coat of many holes
I came unarmed, they've got knives
How can this song survive

Oh now, I can't help wondering how it is
How someone like you exists
When all around you bullets fly
You don't seem to notice them go by
How can this song survive

Oh now, I see the game I'm up against
No wonder I feel so afraid
For every song you ever heard
How many more have died at birth
Oh how, how can this song survive

I brought a song into this world
Just a melody with words
It trembles here before my eyes

For a sign that'll lead me home

It's out of our hands

That have been dragging me down

Maybe it takes two

For our love at each new dawn
We'll find the strength
And the will to carry on
The sun alone will never do

There are somewhere dreams
Gracefully reaching out
To pull love's strings

And I've seen what love can do, I understand
It's like the candle glowing in the wine
It fills a heart with silver stars
That's where my love shines

When light appears in happy tears

For somebody who might give a damn,

Some are as blind as a Fennel tree

With my loving eye, for our colourful belongings to come tumbling dry

Even hell's half acre
We know what every moment is worth
Take it all in

Ron Sexsmith,"In my life as a child I wore the stripes
Playing inside right
As the Captain of the St Catharines Imperials
With dumb luck running wild we won the cup
Waking up every day
To love and a bowl of breakfast ethereal

From a soft focus world where tomorrow seemed bright
To the black and the white
TV light of some dreadful soap opera serial
From a scrape to a scar we left little doubt
From the inside out
We were healing ourselves with breakfast ethereal

What have we lost in our mad
Pursuit of what we already had
When was the last time we saw the sun rise
And what did we gain in return
But a lesson that we'd already learned
Remember that first time we saw with our own eyes
We saw with our own eyes

As the sorrowful leaves fall at our feet
All the sadness is sweet
And the trees in the sunlight are seemingly spiritual

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Too soon, too soon,

Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Over the shadows and the rain

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn

And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

Ron Thal,"Sand and wind burns the back of my throat
I fell while standing on my rowboat
Salt water tightens on my skin coat
I drowned my head smacked to the rowboat

I floated through the plains of sea - an old pork chop greeted me
It was thankful for the company of a dead man who once might have ate him

I miss my rowboat left it on the shore 10 feet above me

I never noticed the chipped paint on the bottom
And now I get to see things from a different view
The sea did vandalize with natural shades of green
Under what circumstance would I ever have had the opportunity to find out?

True pond scum always rises to the top of the water
I, on the other hand, am false pond scum and remain below

I swim the seven liquid gallows
I'm furniture for budding tadpoles
Sock-sogged and waterlogged I slow-bloat
One with the bog fate sailed my rowboat

I'd kiss you but my lips are feed for tuna getting back at me
I am the Ronald-Of-The-Sea in a swimsuit that no longer fits me
I'd love you but my brain is cheese my body's 59 degrees
And if I could I'd surely sneeze 'cause my nose is filled with red snapper

I'd hold you but my arms are weak this whole thing won't help my physique
And to my neighbors I'm a freak they're a fish hook, an old shoe and (???)
I'd sing to you but I can't make sounds there are no more bubbles in my mouth
And when I said I would head South to retire I meant Florida

Is it sooner said than done?
Is it over before it's begun?

When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends it ends in tears

Darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone. turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh, please be there still in love with me",A House Is Not a Home

Where is the sunshine we once knew

They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall

When will those black skies turn to blue
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call

What is the whole world coming to
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die

Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie

When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie",Alfie [Album Version]

And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he' got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my, head they keep falling

But there's one thing i know
The blues he sends to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me.",Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head

Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready

Sing. Oooooooh, baby baby
You don't know what I've been going through

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man, 
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

I dance in the moon and the stars and the sun,
I came down from Heaven and I danced on earth,
At Bethlehem I had my birth.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me.
So I danced for the fishermen,
James and John came with me and the dance went on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame,
The Holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high,
Left me there on a cross to die.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black,
It's hard who dance with the devil on your back.
They buried my body, they thought I'd gone,
But I am the dance, and I still go on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

They cut me down, but I lept up high.
""I am the life that'll never never die
And I'll live in you if you'll live in me.

And everything works for my good in the end

But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph, overcome, tread upon the enemy

I'd hate to think without what I'd do (ohhhhh)

Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
Thank god I kissed you, that I kissed you

Was it all just chance
Was it meant to be
Was it in the stars for you and me
There's a million doors, but just one key ohhh oh oh
It can take one touch 
It can take one look
Well our whole life's a storybook
And we are just fulfilling destiny 

Ohhhhhhh

Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain

Love is temporary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days

I've broken a heart, a heart or two
I've let the curtain fall I guess, it's true
The thought of something borrowed,
Something blue
Was something that I never could pursue

My doubt has disappeared
The clouds are gone, it's clear

Without saying a word you can light up the dark.

There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
All day long I can hear people talking out loud, 
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.

Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.",When You Say Nothing at All [Acoustic Version]
Ronan Keating,"I had a bad day
As much as I can give you girl [Repeat: x3]
I had a bad day and then I heard what you had to say
After I had a hard week it's getting harder to turn the other cheek
It's going to be a tough month without you cause you give me the bump
So this is my last year because without you I don't even care

And you don't know what I've been through
I've tried so hard but how about you?
And here I am trying to save what already died

[Chorus]
As much as I can give you girl
I'm gonna send your way
I need you I can't give up girl
Please don't go away

The day we first met you were innocent and so full of life
You said you'd follow me across this whole earth where are you tonight?
So you go fly while I get sold and you'll go far like we all know
Til one fine day you'll realize what you let die

[Chorus]

I spent my whole life just to find you
And lost it all in just one day so as much as I can give you girl
To not go away

""Oh my darling, how can I get you back in my life
Oh my darling if just for one life""

[Chorus]

I spent my whole life just to find you
I lost it all in just one day
So as much as I can give you girl

Blown away

Baby I'm gonna aft blow you away

I'm blown [15]

You make me feel like a stranger in my own house
You got me running around just like a scared mouse
You were always saying that I was your destiny
Then pretty baby why aren't you here next to me
You made all of my dreams
And fantasies come alive, but it was lies
I gave you all my love and got shot between the eyes

Well baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away

You got me feeling like a stranger in my own heart
I'm acting so together but I'm falling apart
I'm begging lover, begging mother, begging saviour please
I ain't got no leg to stand on much less my knees
You never even tried to let me know where we stand

Was it planned?
That when you ran away you'd leave a bomb in my hands

And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away

Were all these dreams for nothing?
You make me want to cry
We made this flower to grow girl

Not to die

I'm blown [15]

Baby I'm gonna aft blow you away

And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you

Ronan Keating,"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She''s lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes",If Tomorrow Never Comes

Give our love a chance (just one more chance)

I turned it inside out

would make more sense (only self defense)

Ronan Keating,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

I was once like you are now
and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not


How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go


It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
if you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy


All the times that I cried
keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree
but it's them you know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go",Father & Son
Ronan Keating,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder 
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger 
May you never take one single breath for granted 
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed 
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean 
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens 
Promise me that you'll give fate the fighting chance 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance 
I hope you dance 

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance 
Never settle for the path of least resistance 
Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking 
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making 
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter 
When you come close to selling out reconsider 
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance

I hope you dance

Her heart is on a dime

And you'll grow up in time
In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
And please do not lead her on when you leave town

What calls me on along this lonely road
Why don't I turn around and head back home

We are two friends so in love the times we've been together, oh baby
We're true friends in time

My little sister, where did you go
And what is, in your face that shows
A story buried, deep and strong
But that's a secret, one that we kept for so long

Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on now like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stones as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered

Someone says, ""Time heals the hurt.
Little man, you got to keep on keepin' on,""
But all you want is Mama's arms.

You ride back home in a limosine,
The saddest car that you've ever seen,
Your brother can not look you in the eye.
Lightning strikes, thunder roars,
An early winter in that heart of yours,
But you swear you won't let them see you cry
'Cause all you want is Mama's arms.

The neighbors come and bring you pies,
Endless words and futile sighs,
And you run up to your room and lock the door.
And there you are in your Sunday best,
The way your Mama would have had you dressed
And you realize it doesn't matter anymore
'Cause all you want is Mama's arms.

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes.
The seasons change the young boy grows
To understand it's all part of some plan.

Now those are questions you can do without.
You laugh them off and do the best you can

Caught up in circles confusion-
Is nothing new

Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting

With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

How you tried to set them free

Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflecting Vincent's eyes of China blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hands

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
A silver thorn on a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City

Ronan Keating,"I just don't know what to do with myself
I just don't know what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you, it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you, I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
I just don't know what to do with myself

Come back, I will be around

Ronan Keating,"What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a girl
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, she'll never phone you
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what it's all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you give your heart
You get it all broken up and battered
That's what you get, a heart that's shattered
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow

Oh, breaking up is so very hard to do

If you really love him
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less

The minute that you said good-bye.
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry.
And I went from A to Z;
I took out every pretty girl in town.
They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you.
No girl who is in my little red book,
Just ever could replace your love,
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of.
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on.
Where can you be?  I need you so much.

Remember when they were always filled with laughter
But now they're quite deserted
They seem to just echo voices raised in anger
Maybe you will see my face
Reflected there on the pane
In the window up above for long
In broken home

Yet this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

These walls were lined with pictures
Remember the glass we charged in celebration
But now I fill my life up

Fixed in that fine silver frame
Were you really so unhappy there
You never said

So this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do to make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Oh, if I could just become forgetful
When night seems endless
Does the extinguished candle care
About the darkness

It's funny how the memory
Will bring you so close then make you disappear
Meanwhile all our friends must choose
Who they will favor, who they will lose
Hang the garland high, or close the door
Or throw away the key

This house is empty now
There's no one living here
You have to care about

The moment now we reached the middle
You turned to me and said something romantic
'I've won the race and you're the medal'
And all the ocean liners we were passing
Are nothing on a selling whistle
And as the waves were rolling we were dancing
Like we had enough to lose a little

So sure we were contenders
So strong and willing to fight

But it's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life
And though the sunshine's on
Even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
Wasted light

Spill off the port into a crowded mainstream
Looking for somewhere to settle
Soon enough we're lost inside the mystery
We'll be strangers before night settle
With so much to say we've said too little

Back then we were pretenders
So young and ready to fight

When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life

Cause I love you anyway

And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease

Oh whithersoever they blow.
Whithersoever they blow,
Onward to glory I go! 

Hear me, heathens and wizards
And serpents of sin!
All your dastardly doings are past,
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last! 

I am I, Don Quixote,
The Lord of La Mancha,
My destiny calls and I go,
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry me onward,
Oh whithersoever they blow.
Whithersoever they blow,
Onward to glory I go!

Ronan Tynan,"To fallen soldiers let us sing

Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing

Our broken brothers let us bring

To the Mansions of the Lord

No more bleeding, no more fight

No prayers pleading through the night

Just divine embrace, eternal light

To the Mansions of the Lord.

Where no mothers cry and no children weep

We will stand and guard though the angels sleep

Through the ages safely keep

The Mansions of the Lord.
",Mansions of the Lord
Ronan Tynan,"There's a quiet sense of beauty In that lost and loving smile.
I can almost see the angels take a bow,
In their hurry to impress her how as only they knew how,
Then I sit and ponder life, for just a while.
Where the Ivy grows in silence at my beloved home,
Now that house that rang with laughter stands alone.
And of vacant conversations,
Like the pictures on the wall.
Sadly home but little meaning anymore.
But her strength still burns within me, 
Like the day she made me stand.
Put some courage in your dreaming,
Carve your footprints in the sand.
For the dreams are for the dreamers,
And for the goal's for me and you
Light the candle, say I love you
On your way to Passing Through.

Someone's waiting in the shadows for that final curtain call,
And somehow that consolation dims the glow.
There's a man and there's a young boy,
Brief encounters long ago.
There's a joy and there's a sadness going home,
But no turning back the ages,
What's lived cannot be changed.
We are part of something greater, that's the same.
Now I love her and I miss her, she's the one who gave me love.
She's the one who made the boy and the man.
But her strength burns within me like the day she made me stand.
Put some courage in your dreaming,
Carve your footprints in the sand. 
For the dreams are for the dreamers and the goal's for me and you.
Light the candle, say I love you,
On your way to passing through.",Passing Through
Ronan Tynan,"I've been trying to open the door
To the secret of my destiny
And every new road I think is the one
Seems to lead right back to me

I've looked for a way to be wiser
A way to be strong
Now I see the answer was hiding
In me all along

And I'm ready to fly over the sun like a rocket to heaven
And I'm ready to soar right through the sky
Never dreamed I'd find something to lift me so high
I've always had wings but I wasn't ready to fly

Restless, hopeless, and misunderstood
Like so many others I know
So busy tryin' to keep holdin' on
When I should've been letting go

I was given the gift to find it
The spirit inside me
But I never really imagined
All I could be

And I'm ready to fly over the sun like a rocket to heaven
And I'm ready to soar right through the sky
Never dreamed I'd find something to lift me so high
I've always had wings but I wasn't ready to fly

The answer to all of my wonder
Was right in my hands
Now it's time for me to discover
All that I am

And I'm ready to fly over the sun like a rocket to heaven
And I'm ready to soar right through the sky
Never dreamed I'd find something to lift me so high
I've always had wings but I wasn't ready to fly

I've always had wings, now I'm finally ready to fly",Ready to Fly

You know I want to touch you baby
I want to hear you call my name
You may say the whole thing's crazy
But two of us can play that game

Gotta hold on tight
Let's make it happen
I'll take you to a place so fine
(that's mine)
Ecstasy is where you'll be
I'll hold you in my arms
I'm gonna blow your mind

We're movin' and groovin'
And definitely gotta be
Humpin' and pumpin'
I said we're moving and groovin'

You got it goin' on
From your head to your toe
I'd like to take you to the crib
And dim the lights down

And then show or rather prove
That I'm a real man
By the end of the night
You'll be my number one fan
Cause I can comprehend
Understand how you feel
I know you've had others
Now try the real deal
The mood is set, oh girl tonight's the night
I think this could work out just put your trust in me
I won't let you down
I'll be the man you wanted
I'll reverse the frown

You got up on your face, no time to waste
Oh girl you're so delicious
All I want is taste
Of that sweet, sweet love
See man you know I don't bluff
With a woman like you
I just can't get enough
They say true love is hard to find nowadays
But if you try my love
I'll be around with you always

Hump, pump me baby
Hump, pump me baby
I'll be around with ya always

Change it, rearrange it so its regularly updated
Hits from every angle so expected the un-expected
Represent the fusion of the mind and stay connected

In your direction is the baron that we aimed, ascension
Instead the way the floor the stunner made a we invention
And then you get your moneys worth before you've even sensed it
Make you think a four figure for the whole nation
Send it down so one we know it with no discrimination

Deep inside the flow is where its working it

I've lost track of my body count

Dropped in sector four
Non-conformist intimidates
Eliminating all heads of state
The punishment is banishment
Tarnishing and vanishing
I'm runnin' shit
Titanic panicking
Manic depressant
Addicted to adolescence
At the end of the crescent
Dragon's eyes glow fluorescent
Second-guess and rest in peace
Get laced in radioactive waste that's released
Feast fit for a king
Then bring two servants
Words swervin' and curvin'
You'll get what you deservin'

Send a message up by horse

Through the pit and the pendulum
Hypnotic gases still whirl
On the last curl of the wind mast

Of so called dominance
He and I the most decadent
With a promise of providence
I'm adamant about your iris 
Seeing the style I use
When it's evident
I compile a charge 
Like an alkaline pile

Of zero point five micro-pigment

Ronna Reeves,"I found a letter in an old book,
I just bought from a second-hand shop.
It was pressed between two pages near the end,
And I read those secrets somebody never got.

She wrote about love, 
She wrote about cheating.
She wrote about his wife, his kids:
An' she wrote about leavin'.

I took the letter to an old man on Maple Street.
His smile was bitter sweet.
As he held the tide of memories in his hands,
He finally knew the reason he never saw her again.

He read about love, 
He read about cheating.
He read about his wife, his kids:
An' he read about leavin'. 

As he folded the letter,
He talked about the mistakes he'd made in his younger days.
Though he never meant to hurt her, she knew,
He'd do what he had to.
So she moved away.
And by the look in his eyes,
I knew that that love was still alive.
Hidden between the lines of the letter.

Oh, an' she wrote about love, 
She wrote about cheating.
She wrote about his wife, his kids:
An' she wrote about leavin'.

And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Ronnie,"Ah Oh Ah Oh

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shed a couple laughs, shed some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I know that the fault is mine
'Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it but it's messin' with my mind (Because I know)


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know

Ronnie Aldrich,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you

Do you think you love me?

Ronnie Aldrich,"Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said I'll be back for more of this
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Each time the greyhound
Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
But I'm still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I had no letter
It's been six months, maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever

I have decided
I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus

There must be trouble
So I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me
I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved good-bye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound

La de da, la da do
Do la da da, da da da

Ronnie Aldrich,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were
Ronnie Aldrich,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life
Ronnie Aldrich,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh",The Fool on the Hill
Ronnie Aldrich,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
Ronnie Aldrich,"Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Ronnie Aldrich,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

Ronnie Ball,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Ronnie Ball,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Ronnie Bedford,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Ronnie Bedford,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Ronnie Bedford,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Ronnie Bedford,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
