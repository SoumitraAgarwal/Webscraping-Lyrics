SMP,"E-V-I-L E and Ice-T are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove, smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Violent your end, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I don't care
Nuttin bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the Lethal Weapon boy, ridin the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex.. but guns they'll never find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator

You hit the deck, as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent, but listen and you will find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator

Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!""
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin mood, so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss the Syndicate
cause when we chose to move, you're gone
and no remains they'll find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator

More bodies than John Gotti, the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon my page
From Martin Luther's ""dream"", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like ""Terminator"" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator

The mind..
Think!

The mind..

Smudge,"Keep it tight against your chest
This is my time
I'd like to see the table turned
Trade your placemat with mine
See if you can still make a ball
Or maybe eat the apple whole

And the furthest I could reach
Was as close as I had come
I'm in over my knees
And still the only one
Who has to get a grip on himself
I could use some outside help

It's already stale
It's just getting older and my side
Was sinking so quick
That the best I could do was jump ship

Waiting with bad bated breath
For the wind to change
It's just a well worn-out suggestion
To occupy the day
I wished that I knew when I threw it away
That I could deal with feeling this strange

But it sounds so similar
To something that I've done before
So I give myself a slap on the wrist
And you jam my hand in the door

It raises a smile from you
But it's only worth a by-line mention
A simple footnote from an impractical joke
Couldn't seem to hold your attention",Impractical Joke
Smut Peddlers,"Kill that cat, watch me kill that cat
If it's your girl, I'm lookin' at
Then watch me kill that cat

I hunt cunts like these, with underground disease
In they yearly matin' spots, spawn a million MC's
They used to go to shows, drink dance get high
Then you click the mic the whole audience wanna rhyme

In '92 I let the Cage outta Alex
Through college radio demonstrate the fist, fuck the love ballads
Summon demons in my ad libs, fun triplin'
Vomit good shit, go feed off dead Christians

Red light in the Lincoln, from drinkin' Drencrom
The corpse in my eye can explain the thinkin'
While I lay behind a wall of flesh, engulfed by the homeless
If I escape, I might evaporate my whole state

Plus when Cage ripped in half on the concrete
Screamin', ""That's my spirit running down the street""
The undead, writin' in gun lead
Liposuct' a fat bitch out her box with one hypo' jab

Inject tiger serum, I can't hear 'em, who?
Alex with the fuckin' loaded thirty-oh-two, 'cause

This is for the whores, and the kicked over stores
And fifty-four dollars in my pocket on tour
This is for the kid that said, ""Oh, you dead""
And the fifty-four stitches that he caught in his head

This is for the clowns, I beat with no hands
And the two O-Z's, down to fifty-four grams
With two to the face, I'm a basket face
With fifty-four seconds to outer space

I love a bull mastiff ground up, make a pound up
With green Jesus, get in I'll drive you to seizures
Humanoid pause, before God, with cyborg dogs after me
Killin' these rhymin' Sigmund Freuds for the cause

Your whole life's a waitin' room for worms
Strangest occurs, you see Venus in furs
With toast out facin' Earth, avenge my sixteen
Your old shell talk to pistols like Starscream

My whole story lost on a wall in black marker
66 more flicks for Clive Barker
With a little message, for real research kids
Can you guess who the faggot DJ is?

My anti-commercial style will curse you
Say fuck so much, my airplay's like curfew
To third shift farm chemists, the senate scarred
Start killin' all the livin' like the Serbian guards

You supportin' communism buyin' majors so dub
Watch me put two rocks in Kurt Loder head, whassup

This is for the whores, and the kicked over stores
And fifty-four dollars in my pocket on tour
This is for the kid that said, ""Oh, you dead""
And the fifty-four stitches that he caught in his head

This is for the clowns, I beat with no hands

Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, ah (yeah!)

You want Cage in the flesh, paper wants ink to bless
You see me in the streets be glad I spit this stress
Punch through your chest and rip your spine out
Now that Cage got your back you can spit that rhyme out

I'm stompin' on these chat room fakes
Whose hip-hop coincides with them cheesy remakes
You little kids playin' the critics hard
Go back to your other hobby, Pokemon cards

Local emcees won't start it, done
On the mic I make more faces than the retarded son
Minstrel, doin' a hump, takin' a dump
The life of Cage, take drugs, pass out, wake up in the cunt

I got this e-mail from your female
She's meetin' me, suckin' me off of three tails
Don't discuss the details, ""Hee hee I won't!""
Leave a dollar on the nightstand and watch E bail

Once again, this is it

Tearin' up the industry
Sendin' kids back to the lab for more practice
Once again, this is it

Amazing feats happen when we come out to play

I'm livin' in a monotone paisley
Look into my eyes and all you see is hazy
Somethin' out of dark ages paintings, smiles can't hide
Think I'll sit back and watch life go by

In about, four sex acts a cheerleader will begin to bleed
Then we'll bring you up to speed on the orange deed
My seeds procreate I ejaculate grown infants
Then blow shotties in they face to finish the sentence

The fact is, you suck like 'Ishtar' does
Dick Starbuck and Cage spark dust up
Yeah I stuck around like your Plymouth's car rust
Fuck your startin' five, the startin' three are us

Stick my dick in almost any hole 
If I got plastic on and my Toxic Avenger mask is on
Celebrate like my pops when his bastard was born
Stretch the pussy like some starlet tryin' to last in porn

[Chorus]

This is the meaty part of the discussion
Slice the underbelly of my hunger jelly, splash the scene
Crashed the Beam in half then laughed, I ain't shook shaft
Put another hole in your head to stash my fist
And slash your wrists, with a ""Porn Again"" CD
Cracked the jar then the cigar then it goes to E

I'm in a trance with the evilest glance
My moral obligation is the feeblest stance
Anti-semiotic dip shits, wearin' Polo
Y'all ever heard of Ralph Lipschitz?
Oh no, check my aura, in 3-D photos
Whether at regular speed or super slow-mo

We arrive with the sun smog up in the vintage London fog
I'm fuckin your G after you took her to miniature golf
From the floor of this shitty-ass kitchen
I see hella cats in my general chao's chicken
And your dogs is in the black bee sauce
Fuck the wrong bitch raw and have your dick found up in cars
I'm not worried bout no air time
I'm more concerned about when my bald spot'll reach my hairline
Cats be stuck on that Grinch colored lie
With one bloodshot and a twitch up in the other eye
So you get stuck by the strong safety
When you a serial killer clown like John Wayne Gacy
Donate that track to charity
Watch it become a TRL calamity, soon to be parodied
I stay married, to some D-cup breasteses
With music, weed, and porno as my mistresses

The ones your moms said wouldn't amount to fuckin zero
Flaws in the laws, can't be downed by it

They suck cock and rock a 34 in double-D (uh-huh)

Endin up strapped to hospital gurneys
With a stage show resemblin some ""Weekend at Bernie's""
Straight from ""The Dead Zone"" with ten poems
Of dead tomes, now they gotta reinvent foes
Since a child, my (?) on file

Searchin the trunk of your Benz for money to spend

And those dumb enough to believe she writes her own shit
You ain't no enemy, my friends are worse
Got a memory with an endless verse
To serve any emcee within this earth
Whether kin to me, or friend since birth
I'll kill you, hop in a rented jeep, rear-end your hearse

Minutes before I slice your minister's throat
With a miniature sword
So where my local whores with open sores
That want copyright semen to marinate they vocal chords?

Smut Peddlers,"[Cage]
I first saw the bitch at the galleria
With Mr. E

[Eon]
Yo, check that spanish bitch

[Cage]
Yeah, I see her
She was signing people up for credit cards at Sears
Would've stepped to her but...

[Eon]
Mr. E beat you there
Detective Dick lonely. So I'm paging up Josie
36 see's, great knees, pussy toasty
Face like Parker Posey. Seen Stark and Rosie
In the winter looking tan. Never ever ghostly

[Cage]
Fuck that bitch; I grab myself a slut and broke
I had my brain on Josie the whole time we stroked
Days go by and E is like, she wants to chill

[Eon]
Yo you got that leak?

[Cage]
No doubt. Let's lace the Phil's

[Eon]
For rumors narc Thomsons and rhymes I need detox
Shermed up driving in circles for three blocks
Enbalming fluid in the Big Red I was chewing
Worse than the dip whip that had my ass tripping
Who pick you up at eight
So have your gear and shit straight

[Cage]
Yo I be puffing in the basement
Hit the whore when it's time to skate
Leathal leakin got my mother crib stinking
No time for air freshener they beeping in the Lincoln
I jumped in the back with Juice
Solutions fusing the dip nicotine and the truddy Susan
Picked her and her friend up from work
Cat suit. Tight Skirt
Licking they lips shaking they tits trying to flirt

Hook:
Josie! Not what your everyday hoes be
Josie! Perfect poultry for adultry
Josie! Keep the baby wipes closely
Josie! Still taking facials mostly

[Eon]
We twist leak before the bitch speak
Watch my dick creep. Already hitting Josie
But her friend looked like a freak
Doing sixty five in a school zone
Baggy two tones. Swerving off road
Let's get some more blue note
Yo I want to sample that shit
(I want to sample that clit)
Eric and Alex might just pull a switch

[Cage]
I reached from the back and grabbed Josie's tits
Where I can find her friend's lips
To the Mighty Mi mix. She freestyles with a mouthful
Pornographic Serena Altschul. Still leaked up

[Eon]
Yo break up this ounce

[Cage]
True. Knee deep in a box in the back seat poppin her
Start shooting like trench coat mafia

[Eon]
Yo Cage I can't see with that bitch on top of ya
In the rear view that pussy looking much sloppier
Take the party upstate. On the palisades
Stopping on a dirt road. Josie mixing Alize

[Cage]
Ounce a day habit. She want to fuck like a rabbit

[Eon]
Strapped with a hat. Smoked the leaks to the last hit

[Cage]
Is you in love with that bitch?

[Eon]
No kid.   (So switch)

[Cage]
I hit her on the trunk
Then took shotguns from her cunt
For one straight month, we fucking on the reg
She's just a mouth, box and a ass

[Eon]
You fucking with her head

Repeat hook.

[Cage]
Should've known she was like a sister
Stripping and licking

[Eon]
As far as Mr. E's dick, that's all she was getting

[Cage]
A fairly hated me because I got a stinking house
Said they know what I'm about

[Eon]
The pussy no doubt!

[Cage]
To the little bomb bitch munk for half my closet

[Eon]
Damn. All she got from me was a mouth deposit
Word up. Wait. What's this receipt from the Sheraton?

[Cage]
It's be your last night tricking Josie and Erin
How'd you know?

[Eon] 
She treated

[Cage]
She left half skeeted. With a check to cash

[Eon]
For how much?

[Cage]
Six G's kid

[Eon]
I'm quick to stop payments
See that bitch in her arraignment
 
[Cage]
For the next one to three
She's fat bitch entertainment

Repeat hook",Josie
Smut Peddlers,"[Eon]
I stalk down the block, grabbin my jock
Scratch cocks while I dot for my red light stop
Dead right Hobbes I write rhymes for a livin
Hid my misgivings from my brain was still mssing

[Cage]
Read and study while my boots muddy
So fuckin filthy an Avirex butters look bummy
Think out loud, cause I'm allowed, to stage dive in a crowd
of cannibals about to spit across my eyebrow

[Eon]
Now God blessed me with abnormal tendencies
and granted clemency for illegal chemistry
Ain't worth your weight in molecular structure
Out of work like JFK Jr.'s flight instructor

[Cage]
Went, lookin for exits, and tried to get my head fixed
Slept with a perforated picture of Jimi Hendrix
See in these days, Cage is like, 54 ways
to get my fuckin money, mega seedless to blaze

[Chorus: Smut Peddlers]
Sluts, gimmicks, ducks you finished
This is dedicated for those medicated minutes
  Fuck, image, we stuck on spinach
  In a second you'll be checkin into fuckin smut clinics!
Like sluts, gimmicks, ducks you finished
This is dedicated for those medicated minutes
  Fuck, image, we stuck on spinach
  In a second you'll be checkin into fuckin smut clinics!

[Cage]
I ran up in a wack open mic cafe on stage
So many biters I performed in a shark cage
in dark shades, during the Central Park raids
I walked out with a book of paper and a bag of beige
friends, the camera lens (is) behind the shoelace
Get more upskirts than (?) for your face

[Eon]
I'm fresh out the box like newborns
The chicken played with my monkey now we makin zoo porn
Now MC's the Anti-Christ like, Damien thorn
Eric the Pascal(?) land so feel the scorn
The old man, illest show man, my moldin
With logic equal to fifteen Vulcans

[Cage]
And I'm soakin, face lookin blank
Shoot this little kid up with horse tranq' and send him to the bank
with a 'give me the funds' note, clip's missin from the gun
If he gets slapped then fuck it all I'll split it with my dunns
(Bum bum!) I shit on crumbs, got a couple thousand sons
that all shoulda been wiped off some jugs or cloggin lungs

[Eon]
Everytime I dabble watch my life unravel
Did I miss an exit to the road less traveled?
Transmit from the depths of the deepest bassment
Through the pavement, up into spaceships
Deathstar creator, I orbit track wars
My appeal spans Rhodes scholars to slackjaws

[Chorus]

[Eon]
Yo, a Peddler show, include a few heathens
From Hoth to Tatooine, you choose the season
Dialect for all these crews and legions
A walking contradiction like ""Jews for Jesus""

[Cage]
I spit how the earth taste and pass forms out of place
Galvanize my face and kill for breathin space
Nobody to trace, open the trunk like the case
Light the L off of your body and sweepd you in the face

[Eon]
Yeah I seen old timers became semi-thugs
I got more dizzy spells than Reginald Denny does
Cranium blower, Shea Stadium goer
Hydro cultivator turned uranium grower

[Cage]
I'm the, smut chancellor, got vagina slippers for the floor
Show you and that slut you call wifey hardcore
While I burn off the lips, stacked(?) to evolve
(?) I'm down to shoot (?) fucks cause I cancelled their cause

One day I launched a rocket up into the moon
And landed on a crater in a blue lagoon
Three girls in the nude, in the pool they had room
Screamin, ""Starbuck we want to have a orgy with you!""
But never in my life had I seen green bitches
And when I want they would grant me three wishes
One was a pound of the blue moon hydro
Twistin it up, watch my divine mind blow
Two was a pair, of gravity boots
With a space helmet, and a Nike moon suit
They took me from the pool up to the bedroom
Where wish number three, my dick they consumed
They hittin me off orally so lovely
Now those dainty ladies they took it easily
Time flew by, no weed, time to leave
It's time to get back to Earth at breakneck speed
I told the moon bitches that I'd see 'em again
And thank you very much for the weed and the head
They were three moon girls, I fucked every one
That story is over - ""but my rhyme ain't done!""

[Cage]
This is how I get where the fuck I get
I went to Harlem so I could get some wet
I bought the dutch out of the bodega
Left a cloud of black smoke in the air
Took a '99 Beetle - on a magical mystery tour
Your, narrator's pedal hits the floor
Saw a hardcore, punk rave bitch yellin, ""Fuck the law!""
Guzzlin alcohol, leather jacket and a bra
Boots militant, her nose caked up with (?)
Kicked her in the face, yellin Kent
Dipped cigarette, Masai Bai is on cassette
I'm chewin on her nipples like nicorette
Crashed into a Corvette, doin eighty
Face hit the back she went through the glass of the Mercedes
(Oh shit!) Crushed all her bones - and I heard every one
That crime is over - ""but my rhyme ain't done!""

[Eon]
Captain Crunch was a slanger of narcotic cereals
And Toucan Sam was his right hand ""MAN""
Now Sam was a skimmer, a mini-wheat slinger
Killed Count Chocula with the snap of his finger
Tony the Tiger was his arch-enemy
So anthrax Apple Jacks disguised as Sugar Smacks
To add to that, he was flippin Fruity Pebbles
Told the hoe to hit the skids, cause Trix was for kids
Snap Crackle Pop sellin Krispies on your block
Lucky the Leprechaun is suckin up top
My man Sugar Bear was the one they feared most
Cause he was always known to pack that Cinnamon Toast
Boo Berry got caught, at the Honeycomb Hideout
The man with the Wheaties was a former wide out
There were ninety-nine cereals, I ate every one
That story is over - ""but my rhyme ain't done!""

[Cage]
I met this kid named Bob Skarm(?), he had a farm
His pops got shot by his little brother in the front lawn
So he inherits the land, comes up with a master plan
Put Cuba out of B.I., he hands me a C.I.
I got a half a acre, need help with the cultivatin
Thirty-percent of the gross, hands me toast, let's roast
I got a four-wheeler, no street dealers will mega Cage
Won't even leave the state and drop +Indelible+ ""Weight""
(What?) Pushed the plow, from here to Moscow, where do I start now?
Burn the crops if you see cops call blaow blaow
I got it, whippin the tractor blotted
Before the first harvest in the corn rows Cage spotted
the tail ends, under surveillance, merc the crop
Run up, (?) got knocked for the smoke lookin at twenty summers
Six hundred plants, and they burnt every one

Empire structure, elite service
The United States deserve us, everybody jumpin on Curtis
Mayfield play field stay still
Put blankets on Ampex reels, reel to reel
Walk back think back, double backed backpacks
Switch up the upper class, for the double class

I'm fuckin like that! I do it like that!)

I got vintage Nikes stuck firm in the earth's dirt
Thirty-one flavors of hydroponic sherbert
With rainbow jimmies, brain glow in me
It's the manic, run the point like Mike Bibby
The son of Henry, with the last minute entry
Y'all hangin on my balls, tea-baggin like Tetley
Introduce the high post to the low post
And choke on 'em, when we blow skunk on 'em
Kids doin coke mad cause they dick shrunk on 'em
And if your woman wants, I blow the spunk on 'em
Fuck a third eye, my third leg hobble her
With beer goggles, shit and Jack bottles, tobacco
I'm sick in essential elements I sip
Use a tuning fork to eat lace alphabets
Eon, hit the mindless with the timeless
Got a iced out dick, honey come shine this

[Cage]
I stick my skull out for anybody
Comin out the side of my neck fuckin ugly white bitches is a HOB-BY
Callin me out I'm on the frontline sleep-walkin
Three million sheep talkin up intestines for this meat coffin
Run up in some dirty bitch watchin her soaps
Give my daughter a shotty if she pick up daddy's (?) envelopes
The only bitch I listen to
Tried to smuggle in some shit, but I couldn't piss it through
On a bottom feeder, pukin a two liter
Bash you and your crew tryin to sneak out a gay theater
Riddles, spinal town, screwed the vagina down
Cut the body and raped it to the acetate for vinyl clowns
Stuffed my jacket with albino down furs
She went on my plane starvin, eatin passengers
Even semi-digested poke for free
Til Kubrick jumps in the pussy and fucks it better than me

I-I-I, I coat my house in plastic cause I'm a health risk
My landlord tries to evict this
I fuck girls anally and then I'm on they shit list
No S&M cops could hold me
Gimmie twenty tapes and I'll gangbang your Dolby
Battery acid, splash the basket
Now she need reconstructive surgery
For all the non productive, citizens like organs
I live with a tec and Kiss the Girls like Morgan

Peekin, some'll still see bugs on me sleepin
Hibernate your whole state, incubate
Then I scrape off the ambiotic fluids with a rake
I can't concentrate when I levitate, bong lakes
That's all your games when Raid stops on my brain scape

I'm buttery, auction my steez at Sotheby's
Jealousy, cause we be what others be
Now blessed be he who pack abstract apparatus

Your shit ain't workin like Slick Rick's right eye

Ayo, this ain't a rhyme, kid
It's a plug, for a ?cushite? product
That cleans more than Woolite
Other leadin brands emit packages randomly to people
Study their reactions then scam 'em
For example ya, cheese crumb records
Six different flavors and guess what, they all cheddar
I can't believe the time and money that consumers waste
On a variety of the same exact taste
You phony rappers makin music for the rich to dance to
Hope you can get into that circle
But if you want some light, go see Spieldberg
He could use some house, high class herb nigga
To freestlye about chaufferin him around
And can't wait to write about the Benz on his break
But this product's name is Masai Bey
And the ad was paid for by the most High

Out of the groove, what´s my next move
Should I chill, should I follow
Heart is pounding, I feel hollow

Amy's a freak, guaranteed satisfaction

Beat the opposition down

And being held back long

I knew it's wrong
Now crushing sucker

Like a time bomb

Snap!,"Oh oh oh oh, Mary, Mary

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go

Mary, a girl at a party
Pretty face, fantasy body
On the strength, girl was fine
Mission, make her mine

So I stepped to her shyly
Before I could speak she walked right by me
Frozen, lost my cool
Out of the groove, what's my next move

Should I chill, should I follow?
Heart is pounding, I feel hollow
Paused, thought for a minute
If she was a pool I'd jump right in it

So in her path I did step
Nervous but I still had pep
It didn't matter where she went to
I would be there too

Mary had a little boy
Little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go

Saw her at the mall
Stand tall, courage don't fall
To her smoothly I approached
Tried to speak and almost choked

Abnormal for the ruthless chiller
Normally I'm a ladies killer
Why were my nerves shaky
I knew she'd make me and not break me

Here she comes, should I talk to her now?
Yes, it's now or never

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know, oh Mary, Mary
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go, oh Mary, Mary

Oh, Mary
Oh, Mary

Hello Mary, how's your day?
Hope it's going in the right way
How about dinner and some dancing?
Later on some romancing

Music, we could talk
And express our inner thoughts
How about it, what do you think?
Ended statement with a wink

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go

Mary had a little boy
But little did she know, oh Mary, Mary
That everywhere that Mary went
The little boy was sure to go, oh Mary, Mary

Snap!,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Snap!,"This is a song about those bad days
Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphies law chill
If it can go wrong, yes, it will

Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet, uh, oh, a, bolo
Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Ooops up in side your head, say ooops up

Me and Amy, under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as Chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection
Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes, it broke

I guess this is the moment y'all been waiting for
That's right, starting from this year
Mos Syde Entertainment is gonna represent y'all
Na'am sayin'? It's 2001
Now step to this...

[Verse 1]
It is a one-man game
I've monopolized this business
I'm straight occupying all segments
Not anybody else, only us
And it's like that
You can't wrestle with the likes o' the Mos Syde Scientists
Unless you want to collide with the big time termites
That's another level of the pyramid
Where you at?
I lived in Medina Heights
The media couldn't do without me
Dig deeper, I'm eating you from underground
How are you gonna fight this drought?
How are you gonna survive this launch?
A bunch of my duns is having you for lunch
It's like you want to bungee jump wit' us Gee
What?! What?! It's going down
My connection is the way up
Check out the sensational lay-up
The best team ever
Can't you see I'm victorious?
Stop being hilarious
Don't be blinded by the obvious

[CHORUS]
(Never) Never say I never told ya
(Never) Never say it's over til' it's over
(Never) Never operate the swerver til' you sober
(Never) Never trespass I'm a soldier

(Come) Come get some
I blows gum 'cause I hate ""gun""
I'm the son
That loves basking in the sun
Touching my projects with my right arm

[Verse 2]
Yo, you said it
Here is my retaliation
I've always wanted to hit back
I'm putting you in the baddest situation
Stress is locking you up for consumption
This is when I pop to the top
I guess I'm in luck
It took me five years
I been held hostage in the wannabes cage
Now I'm out with the Clark Wallabies
Ready to rap with the tap
This is how I'm back
To make it blacker than coke, coal or charcoal
As it burns, as we dance
As the world turns
Yeah, hell yeah, it's your posse on the edge
Mos Syde on the verge of clinching the purse
The snaps are all zeros
And no shares
You said you was a hero
Wassup with the Xerox?

[CHORUS]

[Verse 3]
I like the match-up
You won't even catch up
I'ma leave you mixed up
Pull you too a stretcher
When I've doubled up
My style is platinum
I leave your side numb
With my victory dance
You know how it's done duns
It's the realest thing right here
To overtake me
You gotta fade me
But don't fake me
Again it takes tons of time
And guts' smarts to rake me out
My bad, it's even too late
I'm too far this is par 4
I can't be spotted
I can't be caught up
I can't be faded
I ain't claiming
It's the game I'm playing
y'all better be knowing
That I'm winning this season with a reason (Mos Syde yeah!)

T’avances plus, tu fais les cent pas, c’est tout
Tu t’sens protégé et les remparts s’écroulent
T’aurais dû lâcher l’affaire depuis, négro
J’viens nettoyer toutes ces saletés
J’ai la dégaine d’un p’tit cure-dent
On a longtemps été indulgents
Le Rap est dans un état d’urgence
Ton blabla rentre dans mon oreille et ressort par l’uc
T’as jamais galéré mais il s’est avéré
Que c’est toi qui en parles le plus
Seuls les vrais savent, j’avais tout l’temps les mêmes sapes
Que j’ai enfin mises à la belle-pou
Aujourd’hui, j’suis modèle pour quelques marques de luxe
Ils voulaient me gratter, ils se sont trompés sur mon compte
J’reste hautain, règle numéro 1

Rares sont les rappeurs qui tiennent le peuple
On a même fait grandir des fans
Et nombreux sont ceux qui prennent le seum
Oui, je sais qu’ils sont nombreux
Dieu sait qu’ils sont nombreux
T’es comme une bougie d’anniversaire
Négro : je sais qu’tu feras pas long feu
On observe tes manières donc protège tes arrières
T’as pas l’choix, gars, parle à voix basse ou ça finit en césarienne
Pourquoi j’suis aussi loin?
Parce que mes salopes sont aux p’tits soins
J’suis comme un émir : les désirs et les plaisirs sont quotidiens
Avec certains j’suis un autre garçon
Un genre de daron, j’ai à peine 22 ans
J’suis en plein dedans mais j’suis déjà mon propre patron
Tu peux m’appeler Mohamed Amine
J’réponds aussi au nom de Sneazzy

Quand j'suis pas là, ça s'enfile
Et j'ai même l'impression qu'elle s'en fiche
J'imagine qu'elle doit se sentir en vie

Elle me raconte tous ses problèmes de riche
Elle fait tellement de faux sourires que ses pommettes se crispent
Elle parle que de grosses caisses et d'oseille
Elle me dit qu'elle a fuck avec Travi$ Scott
J'sens qu'la liste est plus longue

Elle me parle dans l'oreille, elle me touche le torse, han
Elle me confie qu'elle ne tombe jamais sur des mecs honnêtes
Qu'il y'a plus qu'le véritable amour qu'elle aimerait connaître
Elle subit la jalousie d'ses copines du collège
Elle rêve de vivre à Paris, d'faire son shopping chez Colette
J'lui ai dit ""t'es bonne"" en français, elle a presque compris
J'ai pas mon permis donc j'la laisse conduire
Elle fume, elle boit, dans sa B.M. blanche
Han, elle trouve qu'elle a pas d'cul
Moi, j'trouve qu'elle a de très belles hanches

Sneazzy,"12/01/92
J’suis pas arrivé au bon moment, dites-moi
Les gens heureux font comment ? J’sais pas
Mais ma maman avait besoin d’flouze
Les repas organisés par la mairie
Les cadeaux de Noël de la CAF, j’lui ai promis
Un château quand j’aurai de la maille
Et qu’un jour on irait vivre en Amérique
J’veux lui rendre sa jeunesse si c’est négociable
Dur d’accepter toutes les aides sociales
Elle m’a interdit de faire le pauvre
Elle m’a toujours mené vers le haut
Ma daronne, c’est mon ballon d’hélium
Elle connait la suite comme un médium
Elle a jamais fait la comédienne
C’est la plus mignonne des lionnes
Elle restait positive quand on touchait l’fond
Elle reconstruit même quand tout s’effondre
J’me rends compte de son courage en grandissant
Séparée de sa famille pendant dix ans
On était ses seules bouffées d’oxygène
J’ai jamais vu de femme aussi belle
Elle prenait seule son petit dèj
Surmontait seule les galères de la vie quotidienne
Même si ton prochain n’a pas très faim
Elle m’a toujours appris à partager l’pain
Pour le paradis, elle a son aller simple
Elle nous a élevé sans jamais s’plaindre
J’avais deux ans quand ils se sont séparés
Elle n’a jamais retrouvé l’amour
Le passé est impossible à effacer
Donc pour ma mère, j’dois

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Elle m’a donné sa bénédiction
Elle m’apaise comme un cesser-le-feu
J’veux exaucer ses vœux
Le Soleil, la Lune, décrocher les deux
Dans l’brouillard, on a passé tant d’années
J’me rends compte que ma mère est légendaire
C’est elle qui m’a toujours dit: “ Laisse les gens parler
Et, s’ils sont mauvais, laisse les gens faire. ”
Dans ce paysage gris, c’est mon coin vert
Jamais loin d’elle, j’vais prendre soin d’elle
Elle préférait rire et rester digne
Elle nous a toujours caché ses points faibles
Elle m’a appris à baisser les armes
Coute que coute, j’vais la rendre fière
Je vais sécher ses larmes grâce à ma réussite
Je vais enfin lui faire prendre l’air

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

Soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe

J’dois soulever la coupe
J’dois soulever la coupe
Pour toi, j’dois soulever la coupe",La  coupe
Sneazzy,"Salut mon vieux, tu m’reconnais?

Mon père a attendu d’me voir à la télé pour me passer un coup d’fil
Mais t’étais où pendant la cour? J’me suis cassé les coudes
J’compte même plus les années qu’on a passé à souffrir
J’me dis qu’on aurait p’t-être même dû lui arracher les couilles
J'ai plus rien à perdre vu qu’maman a déjà tout perdu
Viens, on va s’détendre, on va jouer à la roulette russe
Ces moments font du mal au fond du crâne, apparemment
T’as oublié qu’maman n’oublie pas toutes les violences conjugales
Ça finissait dans la lueur des gyrophares
Mon rêve, c'est de devenir son pire cauchemar
Quel mythomane, tant pis si ça vire au drame
Au calme, j'crois qu'on va passer du rire aux larmes
Ta vie était un désastre
Tu fermes les yeux, t'as laissé filer un sésame
Ta vie était impeccable mais t'as fui
Et t'as vu que ta bitch était ingérable
J'chante cette chanson assis dans l'herbe
J't'ai presque jamais vu, comme la pension alimentaire
Allez, menteur, vas-y, enterre-toi
T'auras beau crier à l'aide, t'iras en enfer
Vu qu'tu t'es jamais occupé d'moi, j'crois
Qu'j'vais laisser le bon Dieu s'occuper de toi
Ce sera encore pire, tu pourras pas l'endormir
Et si tu penses t'en sortir, c'est que t'as trop fumé je crois
Avec l'alcool et la drogue, il s'est du-per
Il pensait avoir les idées plus claires, super
Chez nous y'avait souvent les autorités
C'était risqué, maman était en situation irrégulière
C'est dur, frère, sans le daron de faire du blé
T'aurais pu abréger nos souffrances mais tu préférais faire durer
J'crois qu'j'suis perturbé, sans salaire c'est l'expulsion
Dans la tête, c'est destruction
Impossible de khalass le loyer
On voyait la paperasse nous noyer
Y'avait personne, notre tel c'était un bordel
Ça mettait ma mère hors d'elle, on a vécu au tel-hô
J'étais petit, le pire c'est que j'trouvais ça mortel
Ta pute, j'appellerai jamais ça une belle-mère
T'abuses, tu nous as vraiment dégoté une belle merde
J'ai vu la lâcheté d'un homme dans les yeux d'mon père
Pour ton avenir, sache que les jeux sont faits
Pour moi, t'es déjà mort, le processus est lancé
Pourquoi veux-tu que j'le désamorce?

Tu peux crever devant moi, j'te mens pas
Je ferai comme si je ne voyais rien
Je peux crever devant toi, ne mens pas
Tu ferais comme si tu ne voyais rien

Parfois, j'ai des pensées macabres
Le genre de pensées où j'suis censé t’abattre
J'traîne une immense haine
Quitte à prendre dix ans ferme, j'vais lui faire vivre l'enfer
Tu peux dire que c'est lassdeg mais
Ton père aurait dû mettre le truc en latex, ouais
Tu sais, parfois la vie est décevante
Le succès est la meilleure des revanches
Il mériterait encore des droites
Je pense qu'il s'en mord les doigts
Pour moi ça baigne, j'l'aime, donc j'remercie l'Seigneur
Qu'il se plaigne, j'trouve qu'c'est un exercice périlleux
Excès d'dignité, instinct animal
J'tiens ça d'Fatima, c'est pas si mal, essaye d'imiter
Heureux qu'il nous ait lâchés, j'prends ça comme un présent
Mon père était un raté, ma mère restera un exemple
Ma mère restera un exemple
Ma mère restera un exemple

Tu peux crever devant moi, j'te mens pas
Je ferai comme si je ne voyais rien
Je peux crever devant toi, ne mens pas
Tu ferais comme si tu ne voyais rien

Tu t'es pas vraiment gêné pour mettre en plan tes enfants
On pourra jamais faire semblant de s'entendre
Semblant de s'entendre",Dieu merci
Sneazzy,"Dis-moi si t'es là pour mon succès ou
Si t'es avec moi pour mon compte en banque
Dis-moi si t'es là pour m'la sucer, han
C'est abusé mais qu'est-ce qu'on s'en branle
Han, tant qu'on s'entend
J'te promets, j'm'en fiche
Tu veux m'pigeonner? Vas-y, j't'en prie
J'suis tellement blindé qu'j'suis consentant
Han, elles ont dû m'voir à la télé
J'ai dû leur vendre un sacré rêve
Sûrement dans un clip tourné à L.A
J'peux être tendre avec toi même si t'es pas très belle
Suis-moi, on va faire le tour de la terre
On dormira dans des palaces toute la semaine
J'ai comme l'impression d'être le Roi de France
J'pense qu'il faudrait qu'on me coupe la tête
Tu pourras rendre jalouses tes copines
En mettant tes photos sur Instagram
Je t'offrirai des bagues et des colliers
Le minimum sera du 15 carats
Même si la fin du mois est serrée
Crois-moi, je casque pour l'honneur
Je décrocherai la lune, du moins j'essayerai
J'serre que des femmes de footballeurs
Donc il faut l'entretien qui va avec
Première classe pour tous ses voyages
La go veut s'asseoir à côté du pilote
J'me demande si cette fille sera loyale
Passe ton tour si t'as des fesses ignobles
J'veux bien fermer les yeux si t'es presque mignonne
J'veux pas d'une espèce d'idiote qui finira dans la presse people

J'ai l'impression de régresser
J'crois que c'est assez récent
J'croise que les meufs intéressées
Aucune meuf intéressante
Elle ne supporte pas qu'on lui coupe les ailes
Elle a que l'argent sur le bout des lèvres
Elle veut que je réalise tous ses rêves
Elle a l'air perdue comme ça
Mais elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Cette fille est caractérielle, j'crois qu'elle veut du matériel
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Demande à son paternel, il est sûrement pas fier d'elle
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut
Elle sait c'qu'elle veut, elle sait c'qu'elle veut

Pendant le mercato elle ira chez l'plus offrant
Chez celui qui lui fera des offrandes
Elle veut son chauffeur, elle veut son siège chauffant
Han, quand j'suis en tournée elle squatte mon bustour
J'l'ai plus vue que ma famille cette année
Toute la journée elle fait des squats en jupe courte
Elle a vue ma gadji, ta gadji s'est calmée
Elle aime traîner dans les backstages
Ramener ses copines dans les backstages
Toutes ses copines sont des coquines
Elles rêvent de baiser avec moi dans les backstages
Elles sont toutes fascinées par mon mode de vie
Facile de baratiner ce genre de fille
Le resto est souvent hors de prix, le tel-hô est souvent hors de prix
J'suis confortable, j'crois qu'je fais un sans faute
On n'dort pas tant qu'on fait de bonnes choses
Elles veulent tout l'temps me chauffer à distance
Mon portable c'est un téléphone rose
J'ai des meufs de toutes les couleurs, des arlequins
Mais je leur parle bien
Ne fais pas d'histoire, déshabille-toi dans la salle de bain
Hein, vas-y, envoie-moi quelques photos
Han, que j'enverrai direct à mes potos
Si tu veux une vraie relation sache qu'il est toujours trop tard mais il n'est jamais trop tôt

J'ai l'impression de régresser
J'crois que c'est assez récent

Sneazzy,"J'suis tombé par hasard sur cette fille
Arrivée comme une éclaircie
Un jour de pluie, je ne sais où
Pile entre deux rendez-vous, p't-être place d'Italie
J'ai bien vu qu'elle m'a souri
Je lui ai souri aussi
J'ai compris que c'était le bon moment pour lui sortir mon speech

J'avais trouvé la meilleure des solutions
Elle voulait bien qu'on finisse à la maison

J'avais si envie d'elle qu'elle me voyait venir
Vu son sourire on n'était pas prêts de dormir
On n'se posait plus de question
On sentait monter la pression

Elle passe par la salle de bain
Pendant c'temps, j'prépare le terrain
J'allume la cheminée, lumière tamisée, pour qu'il ne manque rien
Elle me dit qu'elle se sent bien
Pas besoin de faire un dessin
Je la tiens dans les mains
Je vais et je viens au creux de ses reins

J'avais trouvé la meilleure des positions
Qu'est-ce qu'on est bien quand on joue à la maison

On a déjà géré tous les pains dont vous rêvez
Donc nous vous laissons nos miettes
Est-ce qu'on s'projette? Question trop bête
À 25 ans j'vais payer l'I.S.F
J'ai reçu l'appel d'un certain Monsieur Hollande
J'me demandais qui était-ce
J'dis hamdoulilah, j'me suis jamais plaint
Pourtant même quand j'mangeais aux Restos du cœur
J'ai jamais été riche, tu crées trop d'rumeurs
On s'en bat les couilles de tes sautes d'humeurs
J'ai connu la vraie hass mais j'ai
Pas besoin d'en faire mon fonds de commerce
C'est honteux, mon frère, ces rappeurs me font trop tiep
Restez entre mauvais, tant que les bons se connaissent

J'ai les joues creuses et j'dors peu
Tout l'monde me dit qu'je suis un fêtard
J'enchaîne les nuits blanches, les rendez-vous

Dopé, je suis venu pour jouer la gagne, on va tous les hagar
Tous ces bâtards qui prétendent être la relève du rap jeu
Tous ces rageux sont des rapaces
Pour toutes ces sales races je lève le majeur
J'suis loin de mentir, j'signe plus un contrat à moins de cent mille
Je réinvestis le moindre centime mais, négro, j'suis tranquille

Quand j'suis dans le club, c'est juste pour faire du bénef

Coup d'clé à molette si le boug est malhonnête
Dites surtout pas qu'vous sucez pas
Vous avez déjà tous goûté à nos verges
Ces bâtards essaient de plomber mon moral
Et ça m'fout la haine de les entendre
J'essaye de rester focus sur mon travail
Pour mettre à l'abri ma mère et la future mère de mes enfants
Y'a que si t'es bourgeois que tu t'es buté à la pure
C'est devenu un peu trop vite à la mode
Chez nous on était tous éduqués à la dure
On ramène jamais la police à sa daronne
J'ai fait mon premier billet avec le rap, faudrait m'féliciter
Chez nous y'avait pas d'argent d'poche
Quand ma mère n'avait même plus un rond pour payer l'électricité
Dieu merci il restait la lampe torche
J'fais du biff donc ils disent que je tapine
Tout l'monde me disait: ""Rebeu, arrête le rap, ça paye pas""
J'ai pas besoin de faire le triple disque de platine
À 25 ans j'aurai de quoi me payer la Maybach

On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On pense au lendemain vu que l'avenir n'attend pas
On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On ne peut que monter vu qu'on est venus d'en bas
La concurrence dans le déni
Hun hun, je ne les entends pas
J'ai l'impression qu'on est bénis
Je prie le ciel pour que le vice me tente pas
On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On pense au lendemain vu que l'avenir n'attend pas
On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On ne peut que monter vu qu'on est venus d'en bas

Venez pas jouer, j'ai l'sang chaud
Vous faites trop d'erreurs, je disais
Qu'ton rappeur préféré m'écoute et saigne du nez
J'suis pas doué pour grand chose d'après mes professeurs au lycée
J'suis d'accord avec eux, je ne sais faire que du blé
Cette époque me rappelle qu'on écope de la merde
Y'a plus d'amitié, on oublie tous les potes de la veille
Et j'ai mon propre label, dans lequel j'investis mon gent-ar
Pendant qu'ils se shootent avec toutes les drogues de la terre
J'pense qu'à la madre, pas l'temps d'me pavaner
J'arrêterai peut-être quand elle
N'aura plus vraiment besoin d'travailler
Ils ont écouté mon album et veulent me voir mourir avant
Y'a beaucoup d'rappeurs que j'risque d'humilier
Ils me demandent tous pourquoi je souris rarement
Parce qu'il y a rien de plus triste que ce milieu
J'vais rapper d'une nouvelle manière et je sais que tu vas m'imiter
On va les faire taire à coups d'pompes
On en a rien à battre de ne pas faire l'unanimité
On ne veut pas plaire à tout l'monde

On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On pense au lendemain vu que l'avenir n'attend pas
On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On ne peut que monter vu qu'on est venus d'en bas

Hun hun, je ne les entends pas
Est-ce que j'ai commis des délits?
Tu diras non si jamais on t'en parle
J'ai l'impression qu'on est bénis
Je prie le ciel pour que le vice me tente pas
On s'en tape, on s'en tape
On ne peut que monter vu qu'on est venus d'en bas

J'commence à prendre conscience
Que tous les petits nous prennent pour exemple
Mais faudrait pas que je me censure
Y'a rien de G dans le rap, on est bons qu'à faire couler l'encre
Faites le moi sentir si je n'me sens plus
J'vois tous ces boloss, je vais les éduquer
Et avec tous mes gavas on médit sur ces mecs
J'reçois des milliers de photos de filles dénudées
Avec mon blaze écrit sur les fesses
On ramène de nouveaux codes
On ramène de nouveaux codes
On ramène de nouveaux codes
Bande de bâtards, on sera jamais sous vos ordres
Salope, si tu trahis mon équipe
Fais quand même une dernière prière au cas où j'ai de la pitié
J'porte un glaive, c'est de la tuerie quand je sors un texte
J'fais d'la musique comme un chef et l'caillou est de qualité
J'fais pas du son que pour faire de la thune
Tu vas rager mais j'sais qu'tu vas kiffer grave
Rebeu, t'as beau faire le mec de la ur'

Growing on the face of a Chinese man

He's having his snot for lunch

That's five times two went out too far
And it was a struggle to get back to the shore
Still out too far and it got dark

I sensed a shark but it was not
That's when i saw the fagged teeth
Of a subversive submarine tin fish swimming underneath
I hope it does not feed on me

What does it want? what does it need?
Please swim, swim, swim away
Somehow made it back to the shore
Was badly bruised by the coral floor

That's when I looked out into the distance
To see the tin fish laughing at me
Tin fish swimming underneath
It chose not to feed on me

What did it want? what did it need?
Such a submissive submarine

C'est soit ils s’calmeront
Ou bien ils récidiveront
Car c'est bien beau d’parler
Dire aux jeunes d'arrêter leurs conneries
S’mettre à bosser, mais c'est pas l'Etat qui t’nourrit
Car on est quoi pour eux
Juste synonymes de délinquance
Des pions qui votent pas et qui font acte de présence
Si tu penses qu'après ça ils peuvent penser à toi ou moi
Sachant qu'aucun d’nous deux n'est susceptible d’leur donner une voix
Eh coco, ouvre les yeux, on est pas à la télé
C'est la réalité du système qu'est dure à avaler
C'est soit t'es soumis à la France
Exploité par un patron
Et comme les 60 millions d'autres tu suis comme un mouton
Ou bien tu vis dans l’délit
Mais pourras-tu fuir toute ta vie
Être un ennemi pour l'Etat
Quitte à devoir laisser ta vie
D’façon faut s’fier à l'évidence, Mesrine y'en a qu'un
Et s’tu crois qu’le t'appartiens
C'est vraiment qu’t'as rien dans la panse
Putain c'est quoi la vie
S’la bouger pour des radis
Est-ce croire au paradis ou encore baiser des filles
Est-ce juste un défi : détruire puis reconstruire
Eliminer ses ennemis afin d’se bâtir un empire
Très peu d'accès, finir les narines dans la farine
Ou bosser à l'usine comme nos parents l'ont fait
Place au progrès, on nous parle de mondialisation
Alors que dans nos têtes on en est encore qu'à la colonisation
Accroche-toi à un but, bosse comme un chien
On t’fait croire que t'es quelqu'un
Mais tu n'es qu'autre qu'un numéro d’sécu
Regarde tous ceux qui se sont battus pour la France
Remplis de souvenirs atroces
Et juste une médaille sur le torse
La guerre laisse des traces, et une retraite à 3000 francs
Et comme remerciement la gratitude du gouvernement
J'avoue tout ça m’dépasse
Mais j'y crois, à nous de nous resituer
Afin de savoir où l'on va
On mène le même combat
Côtoie les risques, et j'oublie et m’noie dans l'ivresse de mes lyrics

(Pourquoi) le système et 1’béton m'emprisonnent
(Pourquoi) mon fils devrait-il naître à Babylone
(Pourquoi) j'entends l'alarme qui sonne
C'est trop souvent que j’me questionne
Mais dites-moi pourquoi un jour ou l'autre on doit mourir
(Pourquoi) pourquoi pleurer pourquoi sourire
(Pourquoi) j'ai besoin de changer d'air
Me rapprocher de la lumière

Pourquoi le système m'oppresse
Me fatigue et me stresse
Pourquoi la police m'agresse
Pourquoi tant de pipo dans la presse
Pourquoi chaque jour j'encaisse
Pourquoi Babylone me tient en laisse
Pourquoi elle veut que j’me rabaisse
Pourquoi trimer pour quelques pièces
Pourquoi ça tiraille dans les tess
C'est quoi cette merde épaisse
On peut plus respirer la haine contamine la jeunesse
Pourquoi tant d’fausses promesses
L'Etat fait son bizness
Il nous montre du doigt
Mais malgré tous les coups que Babylone me porte je reste debout
J'essaie d’ne pas péter les plombs
Même si la chaîne me pousse à bouts
Je n’casse pas, je n’plie pas, j’reste au garde à vous
Eh, j’garde la foi avant tout
Le monde devient fou, et tout le monde s'en fout
Ca s’barre en lles-cou, le shétane est partout
Retrouvons nos repères (eh...)
Pleurer nos mères
Ne faisons plus pleurer


(Pourquoi) le système et 1’béton m'emprisonnent
(Pourquoi) mon fils devrait-il naître à Babylone
(Pourquoi) j'entends l'alarme qui sonne
C'est trop souvent que j’me questionne
Mais dites-moi pourquoi un jour ou l'autre on doit mourir
(Pourquoi) pourquoi pleurer pourquoi sourire
(Pourquoi) j'ai besoin de changer d'air
Me rapprocher de la lumière


Difficile d'extérioriser tout c’que j'ai sur le coeur
Et quand les mots ne viennent pas
J’pense qu'il vaut mieux se taire
Les gens me disent à tort et à travers
Et j'en fais partie
La bouche est une arme dont on s’rend pas compte de l'impact
A partir de c’moment là j’rectifie le tir
Joins la parole à l'acte
Et cogite sur le repentir, j'ai beau m’taire
Paraître distant mais j'en pense pas moins
J'analyse ton mental pour savoir à quoi m'en tenir
La gentillesse et la naïveté peuvent jouer des tours
A l'avenir j’ferai gaffe à c’que ça m’cause pas du tort
A force de baigner dans cette ambiance qui m'égare
Le shétane travaille au corps
Et parasite mon regard sur les choses
J’suis loin du compte et j'suis pas là pour donner des leçons
Si moi-même j'les applique pas
Dans c’sac là ça a plus d'sens
J’donne mes impressions, laisse-moi déballer ma science
Apprécier mes réflexions, prise de conscience, et introspection
Le vrai défi c'est d’lutter contre ses défauts
On a tous nos faiblesses : la maille, la fumette, les go
La boisson dans les ré-soi, la mentalité qu'on a tu la connais
Changer de mode de vie c'est pas une mince affaire
On s’pose des questions donc cherchons les réponses
Après c'est chacun sa voie, c'est du chacun pour soi
Et rien qu'on s'enfonce
Qu'est- c’tu veux qu'on fasse on va pas sauver la planète
Faut d'abord s’pencher sur son cas et c'est djà compliqué
Un bête de casse-tête, ça m'a rendu ouf, laisse tout, le kamaz
J'suis poussé à bout là, j'suis trop naze

(Pourquoi) le système et 1’béton m'emprisonnent
(Pourquoi) mon fils devrait-il naître à Babylone
(Pourquoi) j'entends l'alarme qui sonne
C'est trop souvent que j’me questionne
Mais dites-moi pourquoi un jour ou l'autre on doit mourir
(Pourquoi) pourquoi pleurer pourquoi sourire

Sniper
2003 (2003, 2003, 2003)
Putain d’processus
Ça y est, l'beat est lancé, mais où est passé l'inspi?
Évaporé dans un féspli donc à moi d'anticiper
Despee changé, y'a eu trop d’laisser-aller
Bon, Tuny s'est relaché car le premier a tout niqué
Est-ce bien compliqué d'y apporter du changement?
C'est important pourtant vu qu'on nous attend au tournant
Là j'évalue les risques, à la base parti de rien
Et j’vais pas jouer l'Américain maintenant qu’j’ai vendu des disques
Puisqu'on me croit riche, que dire de mes pépettes?
Une chose est sûre certes, j'ai réglé toutes mes dettes
Pas d’prise de grosse tête, si j’me suis envolé en l'air
J'ai réatterie pépère, t'inquiète, j'ai des pompes à bulle d'air
Hep sartek pour les choses
Sinc j'ai investi ici toujours la même famille
Pas d'homo ni travesti
Aux platines c'est Dj Boudj
Y'a Aket et Blako
Conflit pas séparation, les rumeurs sont des ragots
Donc toujours à 4, rabate mais pas cagoulé
Agité, exact pas d'minerve dans 1’col roulé
Touché le M.I.C, laisse mes empreintes digitales
Afin d’toucher ton amour propre ou tes parties génitales
Sale excuse bidon, veux-tu entendre c’qui s’dit?
Nous rappant pour les p’tits et trop d’sky dans l’biberon
Voyons, mais qu'aimerais-tu entendre?
Qu’chuis underground ici
Et qu’j'ai ligoté 1’Difool et ploté la Marie
Bah oui et t’sais c’que j'ai compris et ça depuis qu'on vend
Des coups plus t'en prends plus t'apprends et enfin tu comprends
Des coups plus t'en prends plus t'apprends et enfin tu comprends
Des coups plus t'en prends plus t'apprends
2003, j’te surprends
Auch, nous on l'est

S que t'es auch, nous on l'est encore
N au fond du cœur, on repart en guerre
I, machine à merde, come-back trop sévère
P E R, on perd pas le nord
S, cadron en place, on cadre le tire
N, ième attack zincou lève la patte
I, névitable, attend toi au pire
P E R, on explose les stats

On a pris une ride, tu fais scred
Pour un retour trop crade gros
Sois pas aigri quand on accélère
Et que tu rétrogrades
Préviens les pomplars qui sortent la grande échelle 2003
S’ra mort faya à grande échelle
Qui aurait cru que ce groupe crèverait l'écran
Que des gens crient pour eux,
Qu'ils boufferaient tous cru le grands, qui?
Dis-moi qui?
Quand on était rien tu disais, écoute moi ces cons

Qui rêvent trop
J'chuis bon à fumer de la leuskon
Tire pas cette mine, ok j’te pardonne, allez barre toi vermine
L'instru m'attend
Faut qu'j’la cartonne, ça sent le carbone
V’la l'équipe pirotechnique, notre mastok
On sort la zeb du plastoque et place au spectacle
Deuxième tome, on garde la même team, le même thème
Un rap qui sent le bitume
Un truc qui laisse des hématomes
Uppercut, hyper brut au cromi ça déchire la gueule et l'anus
Du piment j’en ai trop
Percute le beat de plein fouet, je le mets en joue et en tant que Sniper
J’le fini troué ça claque
Comme un fouet, ces jeunes-là sont doués
Processus 2003 objectif tous secoués
Prends une bouée, c'est trop fluide tu risques la noyade
Ces terrains dangereux
Comme chez les yakouz ou les triades
Ch'uis voué à mon équipe, on veut la world cup, cap vers le sommet
Grimpe vite on décolle tout de suite

S que t'es auch, nous on l'est encore

I, névitable, attend toi au pire
P E R, on explose les stats

Tu croyais qu'on était gayz et que mon équipe était dans le gaz
Qu'on était dead et
Qu'on avait fait que de surfer sur la vague
Bah dis-toi qu'c'est d’la baise, on revient tous gdid, mets toi à l'aise
Roule toi une diez
Écoute c’que j’dis
Faut que tu ressentes la vibe, et tous c’qui va avec, la gniack, 2.0.0.3
Malgré mon gabarit, Aket au mic c'est d’la barbarie
Bah oui j’savais que j’les barberais
J'avais promis que ça barderai, que j’garderai la pêche
Et que les bacs on les bombarderai
J'passe des larmes aux barres des rires, de l'egotrip au militant
Les sujets les plus brûlants
C'est l’cas d’le dire
On cadre le tire, la balle atteint ça cible, s.n.i.p.e.r
Obligé en un battement de cil
Remise à jour, remise à niveau, remise à l'amende
Remise à plat ventre à nouveau
Massacrer la parole, on prend les mêmes on recommence
En parallèle, il y a la vie qu'on mène
J'y trouve ma substance, avec tout c’qui s’passe, il y a d’la matière
Et j’compte pas faire
Comme si de rien n'était donc j'ai noirci des pages entières
Meilleur qu’hier et moins bon que demain
J’suis pas du genre à faire des efforts pour plaire
Même si j’suis dans ma chambre
Mon rap, c'est pas elle qui le gère, elle y met le gen-ar
Et la promo nécessaire
Il y aura pas d'histoire

Sniper,"La place d'un père, la place d'une mère dans une famille
La place de deux êtres chers censés s'aimer pour la vie
Unis par leurs volontés par les sentiments en commun
Simplement réunis on craint rien
Enfin c'est c'qu'on dit mais pas toujours ce qu'on voit
J'ai demandé pourquoi on m'a répondu ""c'est la vie""
Puis-je donner mon avis, faut que j'reste en dehors de ça
Quand l'amour s'transforme en haine
Et qu'on s'déchire devant moi
Voilà ce qu'il en est et c'n'est pas autrement
Comprends tant d'engouements pour l'histoire de mes tourments
Le temps évolue, j'ai fait face aux soucis
J'ai grandi, maman est là, mais papa est parti
Et là, j'ai compris qu't'as préféré tourner la page
J'étais pas du voyage et dire qu'je te croyais au paradis
Vu que l'alcool fait des ravages
Tu t'es pas rattrapé et sans même te retourner
J't'ai vu t'éloigner du rivage
Est-ce du à ta vie merdique? J'en sais trop rien
Devenu alcoolique, et tu fais du mal aux tiens
Combien de fois tu l'as vexée ?
Combien de fois t'étais pas là ?
Combien d'bleus sur ses bras ?
Car quand on aime, on ne compte pas

Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond d'mon coeur, tout est devenu si noir
Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond de mon coeur, il reste encore un espoir

Oh papa, si j'avais pu, j't'aurais dit ""non ne pars pas""
J'étais trop petit pour comprendre, j'ai du grandir sans toi
Même si mama s'est bien occupé de moi
Il me manquait un repère, un père derrière moi
J'fermais les yeux et j'imaginais ton visage
J'savais juste que t'étais noir, vu mon métissage
A l'école, on me demandait ton papa, il fait quoi?
Les autres se marraient quand moi, je ne répondais pas
Le jour où je suis tombé sur cette photo d'mariage
Le puzzle de ma vie a commencé son assemblage
J'ai enfin su à quoi tu ressemblais
Impossible d'expliquer l'effet que ça m'a fait
1990, Le téléphone sonne
Après l'orage, le soleil rayonne
Mama m'appelle et m'dit quelqu'un veut t'parler
J'ai juste entendu ""allo"", j'ai compris qui c'était
Quelques semaines plus tard, te voilà devant moi
Est-ce la réalité ou c'rêve que j'fais à chaque fois?
T'es resté 8 ans, puis t'es reparti
T'es retourné au pays

Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond d'mon coeur, tout est devenu si noir
Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond de mon coeur, il reste encore un espoir

A la suite de ton départ, j'ai du me faire une raison
Quand elle a dit au grand frère
""Maintenant, t'es l'homme de la maison""
Elle, si fière devenue la cause de mes souffrances
Devant nous, l'air de rien mais qui pleurait en silence
J'aimerais plus t'en vouloir à l'inverse de mon coeur
Une rancoeur, intérieure, d'avoir juste un géniteur
A toute personne délaissée, sans présence de darons
Divorcés ou décédés, qui ont juste hérité d'un nom

Oh papa, j'ai mis 4 ans pour effacer ma rancune
Un père, on en a qu'un, une mère, on en a qu'une
J'ai rangé ma fierté, j't'ai rejoint là-bas
Mes larmes ont coulé quand tu m'as pris dans tes bras
Moi, je l'ai retrouvé, d'autres n'ont pas eu cette chance
Je leur dédie ce morceau et partage leur souffrance
Ceux, victimes d'un abandon ou d'un divorce ou d'un décès
Ceux qui vivent avec le coeur blessé

Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond d'mon coeur, tout est devenu si noir
Tu es parti sans même que l'on ne puisse te dire au revoir
Au fond de mon coeur, il reste encore un espoir",Sans (Re)pères

Sniper,"J’t'envoie la vision de ce monde (de ce monde)
Et de c’que j'en sais de c’que j'en pense, tu sais
Comment les gens sont, la course aux richesses
Nous a fait perdre de vue le reste
On fonce sans limite de vitesse, la tête dans le guidon
Et à côté d’ça la terre continue à ner-tour
C'est l'histoire qui suit son cours avant d'arriver à son terme
On traverse une époque incertaine ou ça sent la fin d'ici peu
Mate la vie qu'on mène ici bas d'ici ça pue
Chacun veut sauver sa peau mais Dieu guide qui il veut
Sur cette planète faut qu’t'arrête de planer
Y'a que l'oseille de fiable et de bien palpable
C'est la débauche et c'est pas sur le point d’se calmer
C'est pas gagné, on peut pas nier qu'on danse avec le diable
Dans ces périodes troubles on trouve de tout
Des baisés du crâne et tout plein d’malades prêt à tout
Ca tourne au drame depuis les avions dans les tours
Y'a comme un truc bizarre qui flotte dans l'atmosphère
J’sais pas c’qui s’trame derrière et dans les hautes sphères
A qui on s’réfère, on s'informe et on observe
On absorbe l'information telle qu'on nous la donne
On l'accepte et nous voilà formaté comme des disquettes
Les gens sont confortés dans leurs à priori
Leurs idées puantes, tout le monde adopte le prêt à penser cain-ri
Pays qui combat l'axe du mal comme il l'appelle
Un max de pétrole à la clé une affaire personnelle
Qui met en danger la vie de milliers d’civils
Si vraiment ils le veulent, on l'a vu par le passé
Chacun prétend mener sa guerre sainte et la religion à bon dos
Que Dieu me guide j’veux pas être dans l’faux
La planète s'esquinte dans certains bled on a les pieds dans l'eau
Les saisons déréglées un sacré bordel, que des catastrophes
Naturelles ou criminelles et j’t'avoue que j’vois pas l’bout du tunnel
Si c'était pas autant la merde j'aurais plus beaucoup d’raison d’rapper
Si j'arrêtais ça s’rait synonyme de paix
Na na na na.....
Parler de c’qu'on vit là est toute ma facilité
J'y ai trouvé l'inspi et le destin qu'j'ai mérité
En toute sincérité profite de l'instant présent
Faites qu'il dure longtemps que j’fasse croquer mes héritiers
Et sans vulgarité on s’presse et on stress, triste moralité
On passe et on trace, sache trop d’rues crades
Trop d’villes polluées, un pays malade
Signe d'un monde contaminé
La pluie tombe, tristesse les éléments s’déchaînent
Le sol tremble, la lave coule, haine et peine, la terre saigne
L'océan d’vient noir, le fric d’vient sale, grâce à Total
Vous n'irez plus à la plage par hasard
Et l'homme évolue, n'a espoir qu'en l'industrie
Ne jure que pas ses netu, l'armement et le profit
Ainsi ce monde est fait état et société
Remplis d'actes imparfaits et d’critères à respecter
Les moutons dament mais les bergers veulent combattre
C'est Bush contre Sadam et Sharon contre Arafat
Les combats éclatent, sont longs et douloureux
Mais à la fin du massacre, aucun d'entre eux aura des bleus
Le dollar est en colère, petit constat global
Qui donne une dictature mondiale ou tout le monde coopère

Que faire ? Le contraire et leur tourner le dos
Quitte à risquer un embargo et que ton pays mange des pierres
Tu nous as montré ta puissance à travers de gros polar
Gagnant avec élégance et on a fini pas l'croire
T'as massacré les indiens persécuter les noirs
Après les jap, viennent les arabes, le tout en 200 ans d'histoire
Dénonce un discours haineux dès l’départ, tu nous entubes hé connard
Qu'est c’tu compares le coran et mein kampf
Irak attention, nouvelle cible des mythomanes
Ca pue la coalition du sadam, se fait sodom man
Instinct farouche attention au fiston qui finit le travail du daron
Appelle ça du bouche-à-bouche
Combien ont d’l'armement ? Mais aucune source économique
Pourquoi vous n’leur faites pas la guerre ? Vous les zorros d’la République
Des pédales des vraies, cachées sous de beaux déguisements
Qui tuent pour leur gisement d’pétrole
Mais j’dirais qu’face à cette course mondiale
Pas d'amour mais d'or noir les Stes sont loins d'être à la bourre
Malgré deux tours de r’tard
Na na na na......
2003 j’suis là planté dans ce putain d’décor
Dans c’monde qui m'écoeure ou l'mal nous taffau corps
Tous on s'égare les coeurs se changent en pierres
L'homme fabrique tout pour sa mort, l'enfant n’respecte plus sa mère
C'est gore, l'espérance meurt, cette vie, violence, drogue
Sexe au sommaire, nos mères pleurent quand Shétane se marre
Où va le monde, à mon avis plus très loin
J’joue pas l’moraliste, j’suis comme les autres, j'observe de loin
Ce cauchemar réel Palestine - Israël, Irak - USA
Et bientôt un second Rahel, la planète pleure
Mais personne n'essuie ses larmes, on n’voit rien, on n'entend rien
On n’dit rien, car le malin nous charme
Trop d'esprits pollués, tout comme cette atmosphère
Si notre planète se réchauffe c'est qu'on s’rapproche de l'enfer
Homicide volontaire et on s’dit tous innocent
Le dass et le cancer ne sont qu’des punitions du tout puissant
Dans pas longtemps ils diront aux gosses que l'oseille c'est Dieu
On verra tell'ment d’trucs sales qu'il faudra s'en crever les yeux
J’suis pas devin mais la de-mer ça pue
Tu dois l’sentir comme moi l'espoir y'en a peu, j’dirais même qu'y en a plus
J’suis pas pessimiste, c'est ma vision du monde
On dirait qu'on y vient pour des bifetons, une bête de caisse et une blonde
Demande aux jeunes si l'avenir les fait rêver
Difficile de parler d’futur quand le monde est en train d’crever
On l’détruit chaque jour un peu plus
La haine nous contamine comme un putain d’virus
A quand l’terrninus, qu'est c’que j’vais dire à mon môme
Quand j’l'emmènerais au zoo
Fiston ça c'est un lion mais bon là c'est juste les os
Saisi que l'heure est grave, et tout dépend d’nous
Fils c'est la folie humaine qui met l’monde à genoux
Puis merde c'est pas mon texte qui changera les choses
C'est juste un brin d’conscience avant que tout explose
La planète bleue vire au rouge, entend ses cris d’douleur
Elle saigne, on l'a poignardée en plein coeur
On l'a poignardée en plein coeur…

Me parles pas de tes exploits
De tes histoires d'badits
Et tête de moi d'kartla
J'respecte les vrais
Pas ceux qui aiment s'la raconter
Qui donnent trop d'mères en pleurs d'vant les pénitenciers
Voleurs invétérés aux portables dans leur cellule
Du shit aux pilules
Qui sont prêts à tout pour manger
Incrédule, mastolard qui coffrent un 50G
Un cul ou un sac à dos

Seul à chialer
Maintenant tu rêves de liberté
Mais fais gaffe aux miradors
Et une fois dehors
Là tu diras qu't'as assumé
Qu't'auras fait ta peine sur un pied
Et tu joueras le mec hardcore
Teubé y'a pas d'mérite à avoir fait du placard
Si t'es béton c'est qu't'as pas été en m'sure de les bébar
Dès l'départ tu gruges
Mais là t'as pas fait l'bon choix
Entre l'avocat qui connaît la loi et l'autre qui connaît l'juge
Oui l'Etat t'a tué
T'es rentré en tant qu'agneau
T'en est r'sorti parano
Depuis c'est l'silence des agneaux
Et rappelle-toi
Au lieu d'te vanter et jouer l'beau
Dis-toi que les vrais hommes-bon
Sont ceux qui n'en parlent pas


Se croire fort quand on est faible
Se croire digne quand on l'est pas
Quel talent, quelle valeur
Ne pas jouer dans les règles
Vouloir l'mérite qu'on a pas
Quelle vertu, quel bonheur

Le mérite, c'est c'qui rend une personne digne d'estime
Beaucoup veulent en tirer gloire et n'en ont aucun
Ok t'emballe pas si vite, arrête de croire
Qu'on va t'décerner une médaille pour ton vécu
C'est comme les enfants d'stars
Qui ont toujours tout eu
Et qu'on retrouve du jour au lendemain sous les projecteurs
On t'a maché l'travail, c'est sur ça aide
Y'en a qui s'cassent le cul et qui perceront jamais
Des talents laissés dans l'oubli faute de piston
Pas d'mérite à laisser une femme seule élever son fiston
Cracher sa semence et ne pas vouloir assumer
Tu t'es sauvé, t'as pas assuré mate les conséquences
Aucun mérite à faire la misère aux plus faibles
Savater sa meuf faut arracher le keuz des vieilles
Où est l'mérite à glorifier la misère
En faire son fond d'commerce en jouant la carte de l'émotion
Et on est tous à fond d'dans devant leurs émissions
La télé s'met à fabriquer des stars de la chanson
Moi-même j'ai pas d'mérite à dire si t'as du mérite ou pas
J'sais qu'j'en ai peu par rapport à mes rents-pa

Se croire fort quand on est faible
Se croire digne quand on l'est pas
Quel talent, quelle valeur
Ne pas jouer dans les règles
Vouloir l'mérite qu'on a pas
Quelle vertu, quel bonheur

Te sens-tu fort quand tu lèves la main sur ton gosse ?
Quand il part à l'école avec tes bosses dis-moi
Te sens-tu fort quand sous alcool tu frappes ta femme ?
Quand elle a peur quand ses yeux s'remplissent de larmes
Hey te sens-tu fort quand tu prends soi-disant des vacances ?
Quand tu pars à l'étranger pour aller briser une enfance
Te sens-tu fort quand tu vends la mort en bas dans la rue ?
Quand tu profites de la faiblesse d'une âme perdue
Quand tu insultes ou parles mal à
Celle qui t'a porté pendant 9 mois
Te sens-tu fort quand tu raquettes ou victimises
Quelqu'un qui est plus faible que toi ?
Te sens-tu fort mais dis-moi où est l'mérite ?
J'arrive pas à comprendre peux-tu m'expliquer ?
Sur ton cas faut qu'tu médites
Man ouvre les yeux et vois la vérité

Se croire fort quand on est faible
Se croire digne quand on l'est pas
Quel talent, quelle valeur

J'vous présente Aket le nez pointu comme une fléchette
Et vu d'profil l'équivalent de la superficie d'une raquette,
Galbé comme une baguette et un zen en acier trempé
Et son nom, il le signe à la pointe de son nez !
Aketo :
A mes cotés Tunisiano aka mâchoire d'acier,
Quand il était encore marmot les tétines ils les déchiquetaient,
Ses dents, ils se les faisaient sur n'importe quoi même du métal
C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui Tuni a les chicots en freestyle !
Tunisiano :
Enfoiré ! Mes chicots, ils sont comme ta tête foirée !
Abusé même accompagné tu ne rentres pas dans les soirées !
Aketo :
Tu veux parler avec ton front en 3D téma les reliefs !
Il manque plus que les lunettes qui vont avec pour un effet garanti bref !
Est-ce un homme ou un mutant ?
Tunisiano :
T'es un homme ou un pélican ?
Aketo :
T'as la stachemou à d'Artagnan !
Tunisiano :
T'es galbé comme un gars de 8 ans !
Aketo :
Attend est ce qui parait la dernière fois quand t'as mangé au restau
T'as mis la fourchette dans ta bouche et l'as broyée,
Faut pas déconner avec la pression que t'as dans la chebou.
On peut te lâcher sur un pit ou un rote et tu les chiques aux coups.
Tunisiano :
Sensationnel, la barre de pression sur chaque narine,
Vraiment un orifice respiratoire exceptionnel.
Soit mignons tu peux pas me rendre un petit service,
Les pneus de ma caisse sont dégonflés.
Tu veux pas métre un coup de pression.
Aketo :
Attention ! tu veux partir dans les Iyriques, J'vais t'allumer dans mes Iyriques.
On va t'acheter une muselière,
je vois tu grandis, tu risque de bousiller le matos.
Alors t'approche pas trop du Mic, si il finit dans t'es chicot,
Il va falloir que tu raque.
Tunisiano :
A bon, c'est comme ça, tu rentres dans des rapports de force,
Et c'est un nez ou une corne de rhinocéros.
Aketo:
Attend téma les bosses de ton front, c'est un terrain vague.
On peut faire de la bécane de crosse, on aurait dit des dunes de sable.
Tu chétou c'est agréable surtout quand t'est en chien de femme,
T'as l'impression de peloter des seins.
Moi franchement, je trouve sa malheureux.
Hé, on garde son calme, on garde son calme
Un, toi tu éteins ton portable.
Hé, je dis qu'il a match nul, il y a match nul.
Tunisan un, Aketo un, mais tout de suite,
Et bien sûr maintenant le match retour.


Tunisiano :
Aketo petit gâteau t'ès galbé comme un cerf-volant,
Dès qu'il y a un courant d'air, on te retrouve sur une terre étrangère
A la pesée vingt-trois kilos et trente centilitre de sangs.
Et le matin pour démarrer, tu t'aides d'un pace-maker.
Aketo :
Avec ta mâchoire d'homme de cromagnon
Tu fais peur aux enfants surtout esquisse pas un sourire à un sego de moins 16
Ans
En plus de ça t'as le front à Frankenstein,
t'es un vrai film d'épouvantail à toi tout seul et en plus j'te taille.
Tunisiano :
T'as un zéne tranchant, vachement bien affûté.
T'as fait la bise à une femeu, manque de peau tu l'as balafré.
Tu fais trop de bavure, alors pour limiter les dégâts,
Tu dors avec un bouchon de liège pour ne pas découper les draps.
Aketo :
Ton dentiste est poussé à bout, ça y est t'es pites son ressortis.
Il t'a confié à un vétérinaire, ta chebou est trop hard core/
Fais des films gords en plus en ce moment, il recrute a mort.
Il y a le silence des agneaux deux qui se prépare, tu ferais fort.
Tunisiano :
J'pige pas à chaque foi que tu te mouche, ton clinex se transperce.
La dernière fois que t'as éternué DESH et tombé à la renverse.
Aketo :
Attend fait voir ta bouche, il y a un chicot qui s'es chéca derrière un autre
Sa fait double dent pour mieux mastique tes proies.
Tunisiano :
J'ai dû appeler les pompiers pour qui viennent te pinter main-forte.
T'as regardé à l'oeillet, t'es resté planté à la porte.
Aketo :
Et les mecs si quelqu un cherche des pièces détachées.
Moi, j'ai un bon plan ramener des caisses,
Cet homme peut les mâchouiller en un rien de temps.
Tunisiano : Hé ouaie Aketo regarde le corps que t'as, la trompe que t'as
Aketo : Hé, moi j'te parle même pas des chicots que t'as.
Tunisiano :
Ouaie OK, tu me taille mais toi quand tu commande à boire,
T'enfile ton zéne dans le verre, on dirait que tu bois à la paille.
Aketo :
T'es allé à la piscine, ils ont dû évacuer tous les bassins.
Il y a un piranha dans la place et la Tony t'es un assassin.
Tunisiano : Franchement toi je t'estime, t'as plus de pêche qu'un ventilo,

Sniper,"Tunisiano :
J'ai été condamné pour outrage.
Putain le procureur m'a allumé,
40 heures de T.I.G,
J'ai fermé ma gueule et j'ai assumé.
Mais j'ai crié mon innocence, demandé de la reconnaissance.
Mais rien à faire le juge n'a pas voulu faire preuve de bon sens.
J'cause en connaissance de cause,
Injustices judiciaires, suivi de près.
Et même devancés par leurs bavures policières.
Frères, les faits sont les suivants :
La tête endommagée, défigurée,
J'ai gravé mon nom sur leurs murs avec mon sang.
Comprends, la rage est profonde, marre du panier à salade,
L'antisémitisme à la française suivi par leur ratonnade.

Mais on n'en parle pas du F.N, des flics et des skins armés,
On préfère montrer du doigt les groupes islamiques armés.
Demande à Megret s'il nous voit intégrer, ce fils de putain.
Donc assoc' d'immigrés qui fout le riff à son scrutin.
Mon comportement est le fruit d'une réalité pleine de haine
Et d'une jeunesse qu'on a vécue n'importe comment.
Quelle liberté d'expression dans ce pays facho,
Où l'on exile ceux qu'en savent trop et assassine les marginaux.
Richard Legrand, jugé pour viol a purgé 2 ans,
Mohamed Diamoté, jugé pour viol a purgé 10 ans.
Actes méprisants, regarde un peu ça devient dangereux,
La différence entre nous et eux, c'est 8 ans.
On a beau se plaindre, mais on ne fait rien contre ça.
Quand je vois le score du F.N,
J'me dis qu'on peut contrer ça, tant d'fils d'immigrés,
Si on s'mettait tous à voter, la France serait désemparée
Et l'adversaire serait humilié.
Campagne électorale, chaque personne a des droits.
Regarde la tête qu'il a quand j'lui demande ma carte électorale.
La morale, j'incite au vote, 5 minutes c'est quoi
Et plus particulièrement j'cause aux galériens
Qui ne votent pas tout comme moi, notre force la voilà.
Donc à nous d'le faire, passer à l'urne,
Afin qu'ils cessent de nous casser les burnes.

Si on répond à leurs provocations là c'est perdu d'avance
Et si ça part en altercation pour eux c'est légitime défense.
Leurs méthodes d'interpellation sont souvent passées sous silence
Ils donnent leur interprétation des faits, ça y est la séance est levée.
Le juge a fait preuve de clémence, mais ça on savait,
Il n'y avait pas égalité au niveau des chances.
Donc ta parole face à celle des keufs n'a aucun poids face à la loi.
Je pars avec un handicap maintenant voilà !
On sait que c'est comme ass mais faut pas s'voiler la face.
Y a toujours cette angoisse qu'un de ces quatre,
Arrive un sale coup d'poisse !

Toute la mifa est traumatisée, méprisée,
Cette sale race, on ne peut pas nous l'reprocher.
Quoi qu'on dise ou qu'on fasse,
On est cramé dans nos clichés,
Renferrné dans nos carapaces.
Aller voter c'est un droit et un devoir,
Qu'on a nous jeunes nés sur le sol francais,
Contrairement à nos renpas

L'armistice pour les nôtres, qu'ils la fassent signer à d'autres.

Et qui se sont pas sentis viser, les gens sont divisés
Pas sensibilisés, tout est banalisé, on pense qu'à rentabiliser
On est tous matérialistes à mort, pourris par l'environnement
Dans lequel on vit, par moment j'me dis chacun fait sa vie
La famille, la santé avant tout comme on dit
C'n'est pas de la comédie, comme beaucoup j'ai vécu des tragédies
Qui sont rien comparées à ce que vivent les jeunes au pays
On a pas les mêmes problèmes, ni les mêmes modes de vie

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey

Maman je te remercie car je n'ai jamais manqué de rien
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
J'ai toujours bu à ma soif et mangé à ma faim

Y a le malheur des uns et le bonheur des autres
Je me dis que dans le tout on s'en sort bien
Car comparé à d'autre
J'ne suis pas infirme, j'n'ai pas le dass
J'ne suis pas atteint d'une maladie grave
Et j'n'ai pas grandi a la DASS
Rheimdoulélei, j'ai la chance d'être en vie moi et mes frères
Chaque réveil ravi d'apprécier le sourire de ma mère
Je me dis malgré les plaintes, les pleurs et les contraintes
Les réalités de chaque jour qui nous ont traumatisé
Devant des gosses qui mendient et assassinats de femme enceinte
J'ai les pieds sur terre et me dis qu ils ont tout à m'envier
Mais je sais bien que comme tous, y a des pertes de moral
Alors, je me dis que la vie est courte et ce serait con de la gâcher
Malgré leurs abus de pouvoir et leur milieu carcéral

Je suis quand même heureux de me dire que le système ne m'a pas tuée
Donc on vit tous face à un avenir à craindre
Mais comparé à certains on n'est pas à plaindre

Malgré cette vie d'chien, j'arrive à garder le moral
J'm'éclate au maximum comme tous les jeunes
J'ai la dalle, quand j'ai un coup d'blues
J'ai une technique radicale, j'me dis
Que j'suis vivant et qu'c'est bien ça le principal
J'ai des idées derrière la tête et des tas de projets à concrétiser
Même si ça part en couille crois moi
J'ne vais pas dramatiser, je sais que la vie est une pute
Alors j'la prends du bon téco
Ma famille, ma go, ma zique, mon spliff et tous mes tepos
Soit pas pleurnichard, faut faire la différence
Entre merde et misère, tu peux m'croire
T'as les pieds dans la merde, mais certains y sont jusqu'au cou
Remercie le ciel si aujourd'hui t'es encore debout
Sois pas pleurnichard, faut faire la différence
Entre merde et misère, tu peux m'croire
Ça ne sert à rien de pleurer sur son sort
Celui qui veut s'en sort et sur ce on est d'accord

Sniper,"Ouais j'ai le look typique banlieusard,
On ne va pas cracher dans la soupe avec nos dégaines, on est tricard.
Nos têtes sont yégris car, de l'étranger, on se méfie.
C'est cette mentalité de tocard qui dans le pays sévi.
Bien souvent, j'ai ressenti dans le regard des gens,
De la méfiance à mon égard, mis à l'écart et c'est vexant.
Avec ça la paranoïa t'envahit,
y a de quoi au fond de toi la geura sommeille après ça.
Tu deviens insociable tout l'temps tu te sens pris pour cible.
Pas aimable et très susceptible impossible d'instaurer un dialogue.
En plus pour en rajouter les médias nous cataloguent.
Nous salissent et nous niquent la santé.
On montre toujours les mauvais côtés dans les films c'est abusé.
Pourquoi on nous fait passer, j'suis médusé, il ne faut pas pousser.
J'ne suis pas un arracheur de sac à main, survet', baskets, casquette
Mais dans l'droit chemin.

On est catalogué et coupable à chaque fois,
Mis à l'écart fiché ou même montré du doigt,
Présumés jeunes et dans la mauvaise voie,
Humiliés et dit hors la loi. 
Humiliés et dit hors la loi.


Regarde c'est grave, ils nous jugent par notre apparence.
Pour eux jeunes de cité rime seulement avec délinquance.
Tout ça pour une couleur ou une origine qui ne reflète pas leur France.
Ça m'fait flipper quand j'y pense, aller savoir.
Qu'est-ce qui les pousse à nous mettre tous dans le même sac.
Pourquoi quand j'croise une vieille elle s'agrippe à son sac.
Pourquoi quand j'cherche un taf je vois les portes se fermer.
Pourquoi on m'traite de voleur alors que j'n'ai encore rien volé.
Est-ce mes baskets qui font ça ? je ne sais pas.

Est-ce ma tête qui ne passe pas ? Je ne crois pas.
Y a tant de questions auxquelles je ne peux pas répondre.
Mais je ne vais pas rester là à me morfondre.
J'ne les calcules pas, rien à foutre des préjugés,
J'avance, je ne recule pas, ouais iI n'y a que Dieu qui peut m'juger.
J'm'en fous qu'ils m'aiment pas ou qu'ils se sentent dérangés.
Ici c'est aussi chez moi et crois moi sur parole,
J'suis pas près d'bouger.

On est catalogué et coupable à chaque fois,
Mis à l'écart fiché ou même montré du doigt,
Présumés jeunes et dans la mauvaise voie,
Humilié et dit hors la loi. 
Humilié et dit hors la loi.

Je suis un jeune citoyen.
Les gars d'mon âge représente un tiers de la population
Qui est la France de demain
Suspectés par certains d'être voleurs, racails,
Dilleurs, envahisseurs, violeurs ou clandestins.
Jugés comme être la cause de leurs soucis être responsable de leurs pépins.
Même accusé de voler le travail de leurs gamins.
Putain ! tu t'y habitues mais à la longue c'est vexant.
Les évènements s'accentuent et ça en devient stressant.
Anecdote ce patron de bar qui pense peut-être que je vais le voler.
Qui me demande de payer l'adition avant d'avoir consommé.
C'est juste un acte parmi tant d'autres.
Mais encore comment se fait il, dès que je rentre à ED,
Je suis toujours pisté par le vigil.
Est ce de la méfiance ou de la méchanceté.
Je n'ai pas une tête de gangster, mais malheureusement
Jugé à m'a tenue vestimentaire, insulté et sali.
Je reflète peut être la délinquance.
Mais je ne suis pas la cause du chômage,
Ni de l'insécurité en France",Pris Pour Cible

""Je crois que ça ne va pas être possible !"" Comme dirait Zebda,
C'est un pour mon popo et deux pour ma zeb
D'accord j'fume un peu trop j'm'en bats ça glisse trop,

J'ne peux pas l'chéla quand j'ai le dièze frère
J'ai la vibe d'un Snipa Supa Dupa Fly High et là…
Black Renega vient pour Mash'up le show,
Flow mortel conçu pour faire brûler ta sono hey !
Lève ta main fout le bordel si t'es chaud !
Capte la vibe que je lâche au micro,
Et dis-moi si c'est die ou si ça défouraille,
Mais on dit ce que tu veux j'm'en bats les couilles
J'suis chictaille ! Un bon verre de sky, quelques taffes de thaï oulalalalaille !!
J'suis paré pour le freestyle, on m'surnomme le junky le faya space funky
Le con qui assemble ses phases, formule ses phrases
Et fait du son qui claque, mon blaze à moi c'est Black Renega !


Quand on te dit que les gars du Sniper viennent tchatcher
Faut donner le meilleur de toi est-ce que tu l'sais !

Tu l'sais on t'le dit tout l'temps. 
Tu l'sais on t'le dit tout l'temps.


On m'a dit tu veux assouvir tes envies t'as qu'à taffer
J'ai dit non merci pour le moment j'ai aucune envie
Ils m'ont dit que j'étais un endormi et ils me l'ont reproché
Mais j'leur ai dit que j'avais choisi d'faire du rap dans la vie
Tunisiano qui cause, pose à grosses doses
Et si jamais t'atteins l'osmose, c'est que t'es tombé dans le panneau
Gratteur de maille, baiseur de seuf, insulteur de keuf
Squatteur de teuf et amateur de freestyle
Ouais tu captes un peu on s'la raconte et l'on est tous tricard
C'est malheureux, mais on est condamné à une vie de smicard
Au départ, j'ai jamais perçu l'rap comme une obligation
Une révélation, un art qui s'est vu être ma passion
Donc qu'est-ce que tu peux faire
Sniper crew de dingus, nimbus qui perdent les pédales
Et adeptes de cunnilingus
Tuni fait mal à la tête en plus c'est un mangeur de semoule
Ouais t'as vu j'suis l'bougnoule avec la coupe à la youle
Phrasé tranchant, affûté la rime c'est mon penchant
C'est franchement bandant en plus on l'fait en chantant
Crie sauve-qui-peut, Sniper trois tipeus
Qui font parler d'eux à chaque fois donc qu'est-ce que tu peux faire
J'pose ma voix réputation bête de scène
T'entends des rimes obscènes encore tuni qui fait des siennes
Faire bouger les fessiers c'est tout ce que j'aime
Ça crie Snipe, Snipe, Snipe, à la prochaine

On m'a dit varie tes sujets ça sonne trop cliché banlieusard
J'ai dit sois pas trop déçu, je n'ai pas fini avec mes histoires
Ils m'ont dit que c'était pas comme ça que j'ferai du gen-ar
J'leur ai dit que j'avais choisi d'opérer à la barbare
Aketo, rien qu'un Mc d'plus dans la place
Et en plus c'n'est pas du gâteau vu le deumon
Qui cherche à s'faire une place
Faut qu'on remplace les imposteurs qui mangent à notre place
On prend place parmi les meilleurs, bref la grande classe
Faut que j'me surpasse, plus question pour moi d'faire du surplace
À la surface, je compte bien remonter
J'ai su faire face à bien des galères
Au cours de ma vie d'pouilleux même si ça n'a pas l'air
Dans mon vailltra j'suis très pointilleux
T'as vu les faux crient Tayo, Tayo v'la le Persny
Des mecs qui mouillent le maillot,
Flow pétillant comme le champagne
Qu'on manquera pas d'faire péter à l'occase
Tant qu'à faire, on va s'mettre à l'aise
On fout l'feu dans la pacaze, comment ça gaze ?
Pépère, c'est à la maison mère qu'on opére
Deuil-la-barre un deblé duper, j'en place un pour mon compère
Ouais, ouais pour vous un bon rap de salopards

Sniper,"Tirer une tête d'enterrement ou rire à s'en pisser dessus
Le bonheur on l'convoite tellement qu'y a plus moyen qu'on reste en chien
J'te l'dis clairement les gens, les sentiments, j'en fais abstraction
Pas un sentiment proche de ma réaction
Tous mes proches sont sous tension, sans vaille-tra pour la plupart
En prêchant, dehors au clair c'est embrouille avec le daron et c'est reti-par
Des phrases qui blessent comme des coups d'schlasses
Un ou deux s'barre bien gé-char, une de mes faiblesses et après
Ici on s'soigne tous à la médecine douce
Hélas, la vie est une sacrée tass, une bonne taffe, j'tousse
Et là, j'touche le fond, les cernes sous mes yeux prennent forment
Au fond, tu pourras lui dire j'suis un jeune qui pète pas la forme
Aigri, le visage amaigri, face d'arabe d'aigri, physique ingrat
Autour de moi, tout pare en vrille, situation plus que ve-gra
Rien d'marrant, si ta bêtise
J'crois y a vraiment de quoi s'faire du mourrons

Je sais qu'c'est dur mais n'baisse pas les armes
Même si tu passes du rire aux larmes
Pense au futur, la vie est pure et pleine de charme
Je sais qu'c'est dur mais n'baisse pas les armes
Même si tu passes du rire aux larmes
Pense au futur, la vie est pure et pleine de charme

Mon quotidien, biffetons, shit, baston, j'me relaxe à ma façon
Pour la seule et bonne raison que l'chèque j'l'ai qu'une fois
J'suis encore chez ma mère, c'est pas à trente piges, frère
Que j'pourrais m'permettre de tout refaire
Les jours défilent, j'me demande c'que l'futur me réserve
Va savoir, j'prie pour ma famille, que Dieu les préserve
Le soir, j'vois des potes tiser, friser l'coma
A croire que le malheur les a hypnotiser
Si on s'mettait à chialer pour toutes nos galères
J't'assure qu'on chialerait encore et j'aimerais bien qu'on prouve le contraire
Bordel, les gens nous montrent du doigt
Et après, on penserait qu'cette attitude pourrait nous donner du respect
On vit comme on vit, on est comme on est
Et puis c'est tout, chacun a ses règles, ses traditions
Le reste on s'en fout
Si j'pose, j'cause la zizanie
C'est qu'le Tunisiano ose dire des choses
Ça va ça va pas, y a des hauts, y a des bas
J'compte pas faire débat, la France a causé des dégâts
Donc on vivra même si on doit souffrir
J'n'ai jamais baisser les bras même si j'm'efforce de sourire

Je sais qu'c'est dur mais n'baisse pas les armes

Pense au futur, la vie est pure et pleine de charme
Je sais qu'c'est dur mais n'baisse pas les armes
Même si tu passes du rire aux larmes
Pense au futur, la vie est pure et pleine de charme

Je n'sais plus si j'dois rire ou pleurer, me taire ou crier
J'fais le tri et pense que prier est l'seul moyen pour laisser l'soleil briller
Certaines choses me plient en 4 et d'autres me foutent la rage
Un espèce de contraste comme le beau temps qui chasse l'orage
J'suis gris, ma vie n'est pas rose, putain j'en vois de toutes les couleurs
Le soir, je tape une dose, n'enfume la race, j'oublie mes douleurs
Mais pour l'heure, j'ne suis qu'un mec de plus sur c'navire qui chavire
C'navire qu'on appelle la France, notre souffrance, leur donne à tous le sourire
Me parles pas d'horoscope ni même d'avenir
Les choses se passent, tu ris, tu pleures et puis tu meurs
Tout est écrit, le temps s'efface et fils
La vie ne laisse que des cicatrices, c'est triste à dire
Qu'aujourd'hui même si tu te casses la gueule
Faut savoir garder le sourire
Saisir les bonnes occases, pas faire de sa vie un film comique tout naze
A base de phrases, la larme mélancolique
La larme qui fait déborder le vase
Fils, autour de toi faut être à la hauteur de soi, je crois
Que si t'attends rien d'la vie c'est normal qu'au finale elle te déçoit
Mais ne baisses pas la tête, non, ne déposes pas les armes
Aujourd'hui, nos familles pleurent, j'te jure qu'demain elles leur verseront des larmes
La vie est trop courte, je n'cesse de m'le dire
Et plus les jours passent et plus j'en ai rien à cirer
Pas l'temps d'l'admirer, on dirait qu'ça n'cesse d'empirer
Dans la spirale, j'suis aspiré et j'irais peut-être demain sous l'gazon faire une virée
J'préfère en rire et kiffer à bloc les chirés, mes potes, les virés
Mais pour l'moment passe moi le, laisse moi tirer

J'ai juste besoin de l'essentiel,
C'est pour celle que Dieu me destine
Elle, celle qui partagera ma vie
Elle, celle qui donnera la vie,
Aura porté le fruit de notre union
Elle, celle avec qui ma relation
Sera saine, ma destinée sera liée à la sienne
Celle, qu'il me faut c'elle qui me rend fou, d'Elle
Nos vies sont parallèles, je ne vois plus que par Elle
Celle qui n'aime pas le superficiel
Belle au naturel celle pour qui je tuerai, Elle
Celle à qui je serais fidèle, je prendrais soin d'Elle
Celle, pour qui j'essayerai d'être un mari modèle Elle,
Appelez la madame, elle a la bague au doigt,
C'est la mère de mes gosses, moi c'est Elle et Elle c'est moi
C'est Elle c'est pas une autre, c'est Elle et c'est la
Femme de mes rêves, mais elle n'existe pas...

Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...

Elle saura calmer ma colère et ma jalousie,
Ses yeux seront sincères, sa voix une poésie
Elle sera ma femme, je serai son homme
On s'aimera à s'en croquer dans la pomme
Elle sera ma force, comme ma faiblesse
Et s'endormira sur mon torse, ou mes caresses
Je serais son roi, elle sera ma reine
Elle sera une partie de moi, sera celle que j'aime
Et, puis je lui ferai un enfant
Avec Elle je regarderai passer le temps,
Ah... je n'aurai plus peur de vieillir
Quand il ou Elle l'appellera maman,
Quand Elle répondra mon enfant je t'aime tant
Ah... Je n'aurai plus peur de mourir
On dit que tout le monde a son âme soeur,
Alors si elle m'entend je lui tends cette fleur,
C'est tout ce que j'ai pu cueillir

Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...

Nan, je ne parle pas de ces filles faciles, de femmes objets,
Disent-ils, volatiles qui vont t'éponger l'budget, nan !
Plutôt de cette fille et partenaire de mes projets,
Peut fragile de cette lettre tu es sujet,
Tu sais le thème c'est Elle, mais j'dirais tu,
Tu es belle, irréelle, je t'appelle, où es-tu?
Rencontrée par hasard, peut-être au départ
Pour une nuit, des mois, des années, une vie, qui sait
Et je rêve de ses lèvres brillantes,
Celles qui me désarment, qui me parlent,
Qui me charment, qui me hantent
Un corps de femme qui rend fou, qui enflamme,
Je me fous de c'qui se trame, j'aime tout c'que tu incarnes,
Et gentillesse et patience, si une relation stable,
Durable, car mes parents n'ont eu cette chance
Douceur de feu, vivre à deux je le veux, d'être heureux,
Ou malheureux, tant qu'on est uni devant Dieu

Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...
Just one wife in my life...

morceau, c'est le moment de prendre ton téléphone et de l'appeler ou si elle est à côté de

Sniper,"On est tous solidaire face à la merde à la galère
Sortir la tête de la misère pour que les gens nous considère
En tant que citoyen non en tant que chien
La France nous ronge à un point
De ne plus avoir confiance en son prochain
Législation conçue pour nous descendre
Frère derrière les barreaux et maintenant
Y penserais que l'on pourrait se rendre
On est pas dupe en plus on est tous chaud
Pour mission exterminer les ministres et les fachos
Car de nos jours, ça sert à rien de gueuler, de parler à des murs
À croire que le seul moyen de s'faire entendre est de brûler des voitures
Un putain de système haineux, cramer mais après tout ça avance pas
Et je sais que ça les arrangent si on se bouffe entre nous
Soit disante démocratie aux yeux d'un peuple endormi
Les droits de l'homme franchement où ils sont passés
Faut faire en somme que ça change et que des frères cessent
D'être chassés en charter c'est nos frères qui j'artère rapatriement
Et maintenant la haine coule dans nos artères
Nous faire taire franchement ça serait impossible quand on s'aperçoit
Que la plus part du temps c'est nous qu'ils prennent pour cible

La France est une garce et on s'est fait trahir
Le système voilà ce qui nous pousse à les haïr
La haine c'est ce qui rend nos propos vulgaires
On nique la France sous une tendance de musique populaire
On est d'accord et on se moque des répressions
On se fou de la république et de la liberté d'expression
Faudrait changer les lois et pouvoir voir
Bientôt à l'Élysée des arabes et des noirs au pouvoir

Faut que ça pète! Tu sais que le système nous marche dessus
Nous on baisse pas la tête on est pas prêt de s'avouer vaincus
Des frères béton tous victime de trahison
T'façon si y aurait pas de balance y aurait personne en prison
La délinquance augmente même les plus jeunes s'y mettent
Pèttent des bus parlent de braquage et à l'école ils raquettent
Des rondes de flics toujours là pour nous pourrir la vie
Attendent de te serrer tout seul et de font voir du pays
Emeut qui explose ça commence par interpellation
Suivie de coups de bâtons et ça se finit par incarcération
T'façon on se démerde, mec ici on survie
Fume des substances nocives pour apeser les ennuis
La galère n'arrange rien au contraire elle empire les choses
Si certains prennent des doses c'est pour penser à autre chose
Les frères sont armés jusqu'aux dents, tous prêts à faire la guerre
Ça va du gun jusu'au fusil à pompe, pit bull et rotweiller
À quoi ça mène, embrouille de cité, on se tape dessus
Mais tu te mets à chialer lorsque ton pote se fait tirer dessus
Encore un bico ou un négro, les babylons sont fiers
Ça les arrangent ce coup là y aura pas besoin de bavure policière
Frère je lance un appel, on est là pour tous niquer
Leur laisser des traces et des séquelles avant de crever

La France aux Français, tant que j'y serais ce sera impossible
Par mesure du possible je viens cracher des faits inadmissibles
À vrai dire les zincs en perdent le sourire
Obliger de courir certains on eu le malheur de mourir
Des homicides volontaires j'ai une pensé pour leurs mères
Blessés par un décès, bavures classées en simple faits divers
Contrôle qui part en couilles, des potes s'font serrer par les keufs
J'ai le saïme lorsque je jette des pavés sur les J9
Mes potes je les aiment c'est pour ça que je les laisserais jamais béton
Même si il y en a qui béton, tu sais on est tous des jeunes du béton
À présent y a plus de bluffe on vient dire toute la vérité
Faut leur en faire baver v'la la seule chose qu'ils ont mérités
Ma parole les gars si il y en a un qui se la joue véner
Si y veut s'la raconter j'vais lui baiser sa mère
T'façon j'ai plus rien à perdre, j'aimerais les faire pendre
Non c'est pas parce qui porte un flingue qui peut penser mettre à l'amende
La vérité est masquée, à savoir ce qui s'est passé

Hommes de loi, d’Etat qu’a du poids
Vous qui guidez nos choix et nous dictez nos droits
Définissez formellement le devoir de chacun
Enumérez ce qui pour vous, nous convient
Vos lois sont mal faites, nous font trembler et sont strictes,
Les Bloods et les Crips siègent à l’Assemblée
Gauche ou bien droite, la suite est immonde,
D’extrêmes idées sont réduites mais bon, Marine est blonde !

Non, je n’ai pas fait l’ENA et ne connais pas les dessous de table
Parlez d’intégration, pompez notre fric, dénoncez les occupants
Or que vous occupez l’Afrique de l’époque coloniale
Où vos barbares assassinent, aujourd’hui vos colons sales ont colonisé le queen
L’animal migre dans l’air comme sur terre donc l’étranger émigre
Me parles pas de frontières, je te parle du peuple de la France,
De beau jour, de nos chance, de l’Europe et sans carte de séjour

Les lois ne s’appliquent pas de la même façon, selon les cas
Tes droits ne seront pas défendus pareil selon ton avocat
La justice ne peut donc pas être la même pour tous
Je te le prouve par A+B, Il y a eu trop de cas suspects
Des tas d’erreurs aux conséquences lourdes sur une existence
Quand ton innocence ne fait aucun doute, tu deviens le bouc émissaire,
Un coup de poker peut foutre ta vie en l’air, un coup de fil, un coup de vice,
On ne sait pas ce qu’il se passe en coulisse mais ça peut te coûter cher,
C’est eux qui gèrent, ils disent de laisser la justice faire,
Impliqué dans une sale affaire, ton honneur est sali,
Ils ne voient pas le malheur des familles qui vivent un calvaire
Et c’est seulement deux plombes après qu’ils reconnaissent qu’ils ont merdé,
T’es acquitté mais tu y as laissé des plumes, ta dignité, des années de ta vie,
Des thunes pour le baveux, tu es marqué à vie.
Condamné à vivre avec le souvenir de tout ce temps passé à souffrir,
De quoi s’ouvrir les veines, hommage à ceux qui ont vécu ce genre d’histoire,
C’est dramatique quand la justice foire, jusqu’ici tout va mal,
ça fait un bail qu’il y a maldonne, je vois ce que les lois donnent.
Il me faudrait plus d’un album pour déblatérer sur le pays des droits de l’Homme,
Je crois qu’ils nous ont à la bonne, à cause de nos paroles,
Je ne serais pas le petit reubeu de service gogole qui les fait golri,
Bien intégré qu’amuse la galerie, que je collabore à leur shetanerie,
Que je leur fasse la bise, jamais de la vie !
Tous ces enculés voudraient qu’on oublie nos origines,
Notre religion, notre histoire, pourquoi on est ici,
Mis à part alors qu’on est nés ici, mais c’est pas de chance,
Moi j’ai pas la mémoire qui flanche et je connais le passé de la France,
Les colonies et leur conséquence.

J'étais toujours à l'affut des nouveautés, toujours à la page
Tous ceux qui m'ont connu à cette époque le savent
Les années collèges, entre les hardoss et ceux qui écoutaient d'la dance, tout c'que j'détestait
Pour les braves mecs c'étaient la kiff-fun ou la soul
Et moi j'me faisait tailler pour eux j'étais dans un trip de zoulou
Mais malgré tout y'avait quelques têtes qui étaient dans le coup
Ca tâtait le beda, ca parlait de pe-ra dans la cour

Oh c'est du lourd faut qu'j'fasse un double prête moi la cassette

Si t'avais le blouson Starter c'était la grande classe

Les difficultés sont pas faites pour abattre mais pour être abattues

S.N.I. on est rev'nu vous choquer
Balancer notre vérité
PER-SNI toujours aussi appliqué
C'est notre musique
Qu'est-ce que tu croyais ??
Qu'on était deads, qu'on était raides, qu'on était fanés ?
On est passés du rire aux larmes, 3 acharnés, 3 affamés
Au style gravé dans la roche pour des années

2006 le retour est brutal
On a vendu du scud, on a réveillé des crotales
Ils crachent leur venin mais Sniper est commercial
T'ouvres grand ta bouche parce que t'as mal au trou d'balle
Plus de 400 milles galettes s'écoulent, sans qu'ils écoutent
On a grandit l'empire pendant que le tien s'écroule
Les rageux chopent les boules, satisfaite est la foule
Sniper ça fonctionne, ouai ma gueule c'est l'truc qui roule
Alors, soit tu check, soit tu testes, soit tu dégages !
J'suis un man ouvert mais traîne pas trop près d'ma cage
La porte est ouverte et le li-on est sauvage
Il ne kick que les gens mauvais au cœur remplit d'rage.
Hmmm

Reste bien accroché man !


Eh ket guette, comme je m'introduis comme Aket mec
Posé sur le tek tek, daré le produit
Et barbarée la prod, balance mon art au kilo
Aux Beaux Arts moi mon pinceau est un stylo
Chau-da !
Et trop d'MC sont d'mauvaise humeur
Leurs bobards sont devenus des rumeurs
Man, ouai la bouche est une arme
Donc j'ai voulu les toucher
J'ai visé le crâne mais la rime a ricoché
Allez et pousse les décibels que j'lance mon récital
Faut caler le scalpel, ouais je pense à l'hôpital.

Misérables gens soumis par droit de conquete
Et placer sous dépendance politique du conquérant
Quete dominatrice à la recherche d'un Etat
Voilà le résultat d'une puissance colonisatrice
Aider d'l'Occident, ils ont tué et chassé
Se justifient ces terres sacrées par présence d'antécédent
Qui parle d'occupation, Parle de résistance
Qui parle de colonisation, Parle forcément d'indépendance

Des hommes sont libres
Des animaux sont dans des cages et des hommes sont dans des camps
Vivre comme on l'entend, clôturés dans un enclos
Liberté pas pour l'moment, Oslo est tombé à l'eau
Sanglot, cette vie fait reup
J'écris et j'crie juste le combat d'un peuple qui s'bat pour sa patrie
L'Amérique s'est battue pour avoir son indépendance
Les résistants face aux allemands pour pouvoir libérer la France
Tunisiens et Algériens eux memes en ont fait autant
Donc les Palestiniens veulent un Etat au Proche-Orient
Et c'est ca l'blème
Toi tu parles de fanatisme et l'conflit ne se résume pas qu'à l'antisémite
Laxiste, le monde laisse faire et s’défile pendant

Différentes religions, différentes communautés
Pour tout est un lieu Saint chargé d'histoire
Ironie du sort, il en a vu couler du sang
Jusqu'aux événements les plus récents
Le territoire a peu connu la paix, comprends
Que c'est un peu dur d'y croire
Pour tous les frères, les jeunes de mon âge
Qui ont grandi dans cet amosphère
Et qui ont vu ca toute leur vie
Les mains nues face à une armée pretent à ré-ti
S'faire dynamiter s'apparente à de la résistance
Quoi qu'il arrive c'est toujours des civils qui morflent
Et les morts ne se comptent plus
On a tous vu les memes choses aux infos
Les balles contre les pierres jetées par des enfants
J'invente rien, les faits parlent d'eux-meme
Dans les deux camps y'a des extremes
Faut pas tout confondre contredis les sionnistes

Et tu passes pour un antisémite en 2 secondes
C'est l'oppresseur qui prend l'rôle de la victime
C'est l'art de la faire à l'envers
Et pour eux elle est belle
Depuis qu'Israël a obtenu son indépendance ca s'envenime

La spirale fatale du conflit commence

Les médias l'ont compris
Se l'approprient et l'utilisent à tes dépends
Parlent de leurs bienfaits mais jamais de leurs défauts
Injectent leurs carottes en sachet et jouent avec nos cerveaux
Parlent de parents qui envoient leurs enfants au combat
Mais pourquoi?
Pour faire passer ces gens pour des sauvages
Tu f’rais quoi, si on avait tué ton père et détruit ton toit?
J'parle pour moi ou Hak'Allah, j'aurais envie d'faire un carnage
Haine pour haine, balles perdues et plus

Tu n'peux plus rien enlever à ceux qui n'ont plus rien
Plus d'accord de paix ni d'cesser l'feux

Ariel comme la lessive, noir de sentiment
Blanchit par les médias et les States comme adoucissant

On fait que d’remuer la merde
Comme si c'était prémédité
Processus de paix qui foire et toujours des territoires occupés
Des blindés qui tirent, des gosses qui jouent sur des mines
Ceux qui veulent mourir en martyrs prets à partir
Que de convoitise
Poser les armes dire Inch'Allah, bonjour, shalom et salam
J'suis pas l'avocat du pauvre et ca m'fait al et tu sais
Si j'en parle c'est parce que personne le fait,
Refré vires tes oeillères y'en a assez, le dire m'a soulagé

My head is bloody but unbowed 
Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
Looms but the horror of the shade

How charged with punishments the scroll

And I am the captain of my soul",Into the Light

Coolaste katten i det långa landet falukorv
Det här är sagan om
Killen som garvar åt dom som pratar om Babylon
Han kallas mister - sssch...
Han lägger puh på chicks innan han sticker
Han är pang, han är oh, han är Clint Eastwood,
han är vart, han är där, han är Mister Cool!

Ingen lur, ingen brud han är överallt, ända från Lund,
Göteborg till Södermalm
Han är din räddare i nöden han, han är din högra hand
Battlar du med honom har du mött din överman
Och där börjar vår saga, bland tooks och boots var han populär
Men han va speciell och dom va likadana, och vissa snackar skit,
ni vet hur Stockholm är
Så en dag nere på stan när han kollade rean
då kommer ett crew och skrek: ""Kolla där e han!""
Och nu började en jakt, dom var 40 stycken.
Under en trapp över en buss, dom var hack i häl.
Han var snabb för att va cool, han va Jackie Chan
Så han duckade för kulor med kullerbyttor
In på Åhlens å en trapp till taket, ryggen mot stupet och alla runt sig
Så han backar bakåt

Pang (pang), boom (boom), crash - Mister Cool
Pang (pang), boom (boom), crash - Mister Cool,
alla boots, alla doots han e här, han e där, han är mister cool

Nu när nu vet hur cool han är,
förstår ni att han aldrig finns där man tror han är
Men asså kommer han att klara det?! IDIOT.
Han är vart, han är där, han e mister cool!
Han backar, nu faller han ner,
han greppar tag i en visare på det stora jävla uret på väggen,
Och tränger den neråt till kvart över tre..
Nu kommer bängen över Storgatan och skjuter mot gänget.
Det där var nära ögat,
Arrgh, nu ska han nog jävla dödas! 9, 7 vi springer å drar,
5, 3 ingen är kvar!
Han är en cool kille med solbrillor på Roskilde (de, de, de)
Tjejer säger, han är player (player, player, player, player).
Han leder kärringarna över övergångställen,
regerar över söder om kvällen.
Kom tillbaka nästa vecka samma tid och kanal
så fick ni veta hur det gick för Snook... Eh, förlåt,
jag menar Mister Cool

It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?

When I get up, shakin' up, breakin' up, takin' up
Tryna get my money on, tryna cake up

No disrespect to the white, but you know
When your black your black
You got to do one thing and try an get some get back
Uh it's the truth, it's a fact
That when your black, everybody on ya back
It's true, it's a fact
That when your black, everybody tryna take yo stack
Now watch out for the rat pack
From the black, yo' niggas in the front, yo' niggas in the back
Yo' niggas who got stack, and yo' niggas who got 'Lacs
Yo' niggas who don't get it, but yo' niggas who pack
Now you gotsta have a full game, cuz if you gone be black
You gotsta watch out, cuz these niggas want stacks
These niggas on a mission and they have to rat pack
They don't give a fuck, cuz these niggas is black
They being black about the mind, being black about paper
But being all about black ain't givin you vapors
And try to put you up on game and try to show ya
That if you ain't black, you besta get a white lawyer
Cuz I'ma tell ya and give ya the game, that
Being black is like being in the yang
Cuz they always gone label you, always gone fable you
And always gone point at you when somethin' go down
And I knew, that it would be me, and not jiz-ou
Cuz they know that I roll, with the biggest black criz-ew
And we all about gettin' green
But when your black tryin' to get green,
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?
Cuz they always gonna, stop ya - drop ya - pop ya - mop ya
And then they gonna sweep ya, up under the rug
No more gangbangin', no more hidin' out thug
I'm tellin' you the real, you better feel what I feel
Cuz these niggas on a mission, a mission to kill
And they ain't askin' nobody and that's a fact
You better watch out if your black

We all people
So tell me what we do to get cheated the same
Oooooohhh
Beware people
Better watch your back and step up your game
Beware, beware
We all people
Tell me when we gonna get cheated the same

[Snoop over chorus]
Uh, it's true that when your black, they out for ya stack
Gotta watch ya back, cuz niggas is niggas,
And that's part of being black
You gotta keep ya eyes on ya stack
These niggas gone getcha black, uh it's real
It's a fact, cuz ya gotta watch yourself when your kinda black
Be real, watch ya back,
Cuz if you don't these niggas gone getcha black

[Snoop Dogg]
Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other 
Way, just play and say what you wanna say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
Cuz I'ma tell ya, watch them niggas,
Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care cuz they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin', they gettin' you and gettin' away
Its part of the pay, it's part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all related
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game piece from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

So Snoop Dogg speak the real
It don't even make a difference if it got matching sho'real

[Snoop Dogg]
Uh, it's like that,
Then your black, they out for ya stack
And it's a fact, when your black, ya can't come back
Cuz if ya go to the hood, they watchin' you
They will lurk in you, they gonna get you
Cuz your not payin' attention, you led a nigga too much,
But that nigga straight snitchin'

[Chorus]
We all people
So tell me what we do to get cheated the same
Oooooohhh
Beware people
Better watch your back and step up your game
Beware, beware
We all people
Tell me when we gonna get cheated the same
Beware people
Better watch your back and step up your game

But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga Coolio

Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive

So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now

It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes

I want to see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog

Pleading guilty, you know for my skills I'm about to be
Filthy large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin don't try to play large
This ain't no Rerun, see hun, don't ya want to be one

I'm loco, close to Constantinople,
I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin stuff, hey yo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck!

This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers trying to be like me
Every since I put it down with the D-are-E

Foaming at the mouth and wagging his tail
Searching through the yards with a keen sense of smell
Looking for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffing her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle
Yo motherfucking hoes
He fucked the fleas off a bitch
He shacked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfucking bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Damn, that Tanqueray is talking to a nigga
I ain't bullshitting, one of y'all niggas gotta get it

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'cause it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditioning
Which we create, 'cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every-day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said um ""Mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all?""
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my White Sox, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said um

It's all because of you, I'm feeling said and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, ""What was going on?""
I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""
She grabbed my closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbing my dick
And saying

Why don't you give me a play
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said, ""Cheer up!"" so I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""
She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts crying
I says I'm nineteen, she says, ""Stop lying!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""
Yeah, tic toc you don't stop
And to the, ah tic toc and you don't quit
Yeah, tic toc and ya don't stop, and to the
Ah tic toc and ya don't quit, bitch!",Lodi Dodi
Snoop Dogg,"As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flagging me down
Saying, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Hey yo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, if you ain't up on things
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thing, to gang-bang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's

And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't want to be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety

Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fucking chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruff-neck

So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on

Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryin' to spit at my motherf***in hoes
Seakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point

All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I want to see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton

(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin' out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes

Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the f*** of it
Ruff and rugged s***, it's un-explanatory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it

Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin'
Hit the button, and light s*** up like Red Dawn

Peep, the ma**icre from a verbal a**a**in
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you f***in wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin' out looney like O-Dog

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg s***)

Diggity Daz out of the motherf***in cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
'Til I die I'm still screamin' that (b****es ain't s***)

Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about 
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb
As you groove to the gangster s***
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique

Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the f*** you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

Niggaz coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches

We got meat to eat, (freaks to meet)
And chronic we can smoke on, (if I ever get a loc on)
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J. with my homie named Tray

Back together like it was supposed to see

Tray:
Cause ya know I'm down with ya to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating when crackers was the daily's

Snoop:
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up?)
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the stealers and killin' with the raiders

Tray:
And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke
Now we're breaking 'em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking 'em up

Snoop Dogg,"This is Angela Sanders coming to you live 
From the scene of yet another murder mystery 
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered 
We have no information at this time 

(I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it)

As I look up at the sky 
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye 
My body temperature falls 
I'm shaking, and they breaking, trying to save the Dogg 
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming 
I stop breathing, damn I see daemons 
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me 
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby 
I think it's too late for praying, hold up 
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
""Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"" 
And how long will I live? 
""Eternal life and forever"" 
And will I be, the G that I was? 
""I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of 
So relax your soul, let me take control 
Close your eyes my son"" 
My eyes are closed 

Murder ""murder was the case that they gave me"" [Repeat: x4]
I'm fresh up out my coma 
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner 
It's gonna take a miracle they say 
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway 
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet 
And everything that nigga said, came to reality 
Living like a baller loc 
I'm having money, and blowing hella chronic smoke 
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag 
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad 
""Just remember who changed your mind 
'cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine"" 
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed 
Never have a want, never have a need 
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo' 
Cause my eyes want to journey some more, really doe (check it out) 

Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the lord, my soul to keep 
If I should die, before I wake 
I pray the lord, my soul to take 

Murder was the case that they gave me 
""Murder was the case that they gave me"" [Repeat: x2]

No more indo, gin and juice 
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the gray goose 
Shackled from head to toe 
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know 
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face 
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care 
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair 
Niggas stare as I enter the center 
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay 
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor 
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off 
Cause you can't tell what's next 
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck 
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two 
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Snoop Dogg,"Nine in the mornin' feds at my door (my door) 
Lou Cortez creakin' cross the hardwood floor (right) 
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape 
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape 
Man with no music but happy he's free 
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street 
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand 
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand 
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC 
Remotely controlled by the bombity 
But just livin' in big city is a serious task 
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask 

We're comin' with that G shit, that see shit that makin' niggas sick 
How does it feel to see a G from your clique? 
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?) 
Last night's dice game got my win on 
About a G and a half is what I come with 
But twenty five G's is what I left with 
Teatley was the word I heard 
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone 
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas 
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie 
Seven-four-four-tre back to back 
I sent two fools back to their lizzack 

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift 
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip 
But I chill 'cause my ho might call 
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall 
And I takes a quick walk up the block 
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop 
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin' 
That's where a nigga'll be slangin 
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me 
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki 
And now the shops on deck 
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step 
Now I got ends 
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends 
But I could only trust a few 
And unawarely I trusted you 
But if only G 

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go 
Devoted and quotin', back in '84 
I was thirteen, G was a year older 
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders 
Gettin' good on the hood was the anticipation 
And yeah, King Park was the destination 
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night 
Even the smokers that be levellin' gettin' sparked tonight 

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey 
'Cause I represent like every day 
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot 
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot 
From at least about five years ago 
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall 
The homey use to come up to the school and rock 
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock 
Damn them was the days of the past 
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin' people's ass 
And everybody a blast 
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz 
And that's your ass 
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha) 
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust) 
'cause I let it sit that day 
I wished I was there I would've clowned 
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound 
'cause he wouldn't even squad back 
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that 
He'll get us all cracked 
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap 
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!) 
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah) 

Some of these nigga are bitches too 
And some of these niggas look just like you 
So if you've ever been toetone 
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on 

It's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin 
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee 
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack 
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack 
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection 
And let me dial slow, flossin', tossin' a bitch (bitch) 
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention 
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten 
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends 
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal 
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G 
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me 

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you 
So what made them niggas try to spit at you 
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you 
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too 

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha) 
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you 
'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes 
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota 
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt 
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk 
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest 
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up 
My hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin' 
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots 
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah) 
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1 
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know 
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho

Out on the scout I'm about my papers
Cause ain't nobody doing Deee no favors
I'm trying ta get major with minor risk
Maximizing the minimum of time is spent
on the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keeping niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm booking em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline 'cause I got a Tek9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailing with

is what I claim but my game is DPG

Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doing what'cha supposed to so you gots ta prove
something to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doing it for yourself it don't matter
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up,
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up,
Wake up, wake up wake up,
Get up, get up, get up,

I break fools off like lepresy
If they dare, you stare when they next to me
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the ""penta""
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
so try me you're liable to lose on my line
The 44'll be what cracks ya head
'cause that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with
I figured niggas getting soft like jellatine

Sit back relax and let me drop another rap
but this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be grooving it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
and like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
and don't think a nigga sprung 'cause you know a nigga fuck
Love is a house and you got the key

Snoop Dogg,"The dog saw I'm, they tear, they, looked liked they try to tear him off
I said ""Oh my God! They want to eat my husband

I was sitting at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was getting thinner
My nigga Sparky-O was playing basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, y'all about to squab my Doggs
Dirty work gets cream, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble, Friday 'cause that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kidding nigga, my Doggs scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbing behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on,
And ain't no need to reach for heat 'cause you can't get your blast on
Doggs we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
She got killed so I didn't need him
It's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thing
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
Cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
Cause I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rolling with me
We're laying low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-do and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
See now this bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just

Me and my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz

Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm supafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggs then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko 'cause he go taken my swim
I think cause my cream my low, get aback to the pound
He gon' be itching like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thing that your ass can do
I think it's cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gang-banged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-head
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit

(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard

All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cause I'ma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm trying to keep it real Dogg
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Just keep it real Dogg
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Fly G boys and all you hood-rat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, 
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hitting licks like a doberman gang
Why'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

[Chorus: x2]

They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knocking at'cha door
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting
Busting, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch

Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinking many plots blossoms how amny times?
I'm sedated my ""conscriptiated"" from beginning 
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my locs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly cause all they smoke is phillies
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in Darby tip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catching cases,robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that

Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop

Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best

We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
Any MC trying to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
In '96,with a different approach I'm shit
I got the flavor and I'm major,bust the ass
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I bet ya I won't let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, staying true
Demanding my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
With the every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stomping, stepping with my projectile weapon

Whats up ""Jex"" so's eject the hum
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeating and deleting elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringing drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, something up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs 
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as ""bombing ya"",suffer from insomnia
And I'm a gonna be coming for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance

I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em

You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on, 
Let me flow on

You can rock to tha rythme you see 
or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang,
Make sure you do your thang on a hang

And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

[Chorus]

Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)

Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop
Have prestigious women 
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the flyest hotels

You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death

No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind, 

'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt.
Walkin' round town all strapped in,
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.
All this deception on top of stress,
You havin' more problems than a algebra test.
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there 
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

[Chorus]

Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys 
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.
You chillin' with yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up.
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll.
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be 
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

[Chorus]

Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.
To a place that be, call it LBC. 
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,
Know what I'm sayin'?
Cause he travelin' in the fast lane.

Stop the life it seem that we are on,
Time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home,
Stop the life it seem that we are on,
Time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home.

Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free,
And ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another 
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother.
(And what about the mothers?)
They queens,
Righteous, 
Man,
Heaven must be like this,
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime.
Ain't no penitentiaries and ain't nobody doin' time.
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,
I'm smarter than the senator,
Bigger than the mayor.
Heaven on Earth 
It's like a prayer.
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
To be a player.
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there,
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business, racketeering
Smuggling, doing things from handing a gun,is what they fearing
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you show them my money, your ass is getting f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thing in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to taking them out!

[Daz]
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

[Tray Dee]
I had no choice or remorse for time for putting it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet making it pop
Young crook keeping hook, nigga, shaking the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself 'cause there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cause the niggas that I dared to ""agank"" the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm hauling my heat I'm stalling
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listening
And war story glory ain't worth the risking
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm taking em out!

I come through blasting, me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashing, may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone, Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the you-S-see, I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's, 87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die, till we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums   
We ran outta dope, I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself, me my dope, me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges, I budge when I buzz

Hey Dogg, let me holla at'cha man

[Snoop]
Whats up home?

[Homey]
Word is on the streets
Your beats gone be delicate since Dre did shake the spea's out,
Man.

[Snoop]
Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

I got more niggas trying to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be trying to get at me 'cause I be dropping funky rhymes
What the fuck is going on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, acting way too funny
Doing too much, why'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's going on wit you niggas, y'all trying to play a low pro
And trying ta be hard and trying ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say something wrong, I'm taking off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cause I done been bombed on before and I'ma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'ma keep my thing together
Cause I'ma keep making money and hope everything is still together
Having papers, man, now what y'all niggas doing?
All y'all broke on the corner, drinking your drink, want to be doing what I'm doing
But don't get mad and don't be trying to play-hate
Cause, taking trips around state to state
Representing, what y'all want to represent
But y'all can't represent it 'cause y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm moving on, grooving on and I'm moving
Making more moves than the average Cuban
Trying ta get G's across the town, trying ta make more hits
And trying to get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cause she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cause everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cause when you do, we gone be sipping on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feeling good tonight
Cause I'ma do mines and I'ma keep everything tight
I ain't letting nothing leak 'cause if things leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught 'cause you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Getting 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be paying no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like that, ain't that right
Cause, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talking about you want to be the man
Cause if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

One of every five black males berfore the year 2000 will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, we scared to go to church

Look here, but don't cut it, getting five points
Step back for a second, I'm putting less than five to this joint
If this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be tripping but I'll be pimping
I don't be tripping off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just trying to get money, I don't even be tripping off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'know what I'm sayin?
I love the Lakers now 'cause now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nothing but Dogg Pound
Give it to ya ta put it down and we'll be round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait til we come through
Until we do just keep smoking gray and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cause we gone keep doing what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cause the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Trying ta get up on game but they don't want to be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody want to dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Making y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'ma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hos
Drinking my drink, smoking my dank
Counting my bank, that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got 'cause I'ma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfucking secret

Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas looking for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me running from my life, I'm jumping gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police,
Game recognize Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dipping with this ho
They run right past me, ask me ""Have I seen the suspect?""
""Yeah, he went that way"", now for the jack",Freestyle Conversation

Josey Wales was known for robbing trains and things
Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[LBC Crew]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got's lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't making no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

We high, blazing like crazy, we don't know why
feeling good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way

they want to play wit their minds like little girls

rubbed my fingers through my hair

but I play hos like plenty-leany cause I get greedy

and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

pulling hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
being from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay

Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi

Yo Doggy Dogg you're on, live on stage
Performing tonight, excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
You know! The one and only
Don Corleone, the big homey why'know me

Well if it's on I guess it's bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
And I takes my time when I'm droppin my lines
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)
All in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Trying ta make their paper, trying to do their thang
But to me they all trying to say the same thang
How could you rap over ""be said what?""
You ain't reaching the crowd, you ain't makin your fact
You ain't dropping lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without usin mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'ma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'ma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a, smooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Is that right? That's right black
But

Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they
Even tripping on me? Yeah the big homey
Gamey Gamey says ""Snoop Corleone
Listen to me man, stay away from them phoneys
It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick
You gots ta stay focused Dogg, keep your eye on your grip
Cause if you slip they gon' get'cha and they gon' get'cha fast
These niggas out for your money man, they tryin to get your cash""
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match
You can be from the East Coast and get love 'cause I ain't tripping on your ass
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC
I get'cha crazy
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, ba-by
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk
Now don't do nothing that you can't get out of me
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it

[Chorus: x2]

I got the, I got the, I got the paper
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya crying
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga
Ya better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)

Uh, it don't quit
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit
I'm just drifting, so swift and smooth
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?
I can't name nobody
So sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
Cause everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playing cool
Ain't no set tripping, everybody just dipping
Bitches getting with niggas and niggas getting bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in your pocket
Unlock it 'cause Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)

Snoop Dogg,"Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)

Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About ""I'll fuck you up"", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Killing up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoos that's how they got you
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and originals, here come the mission
Making biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey
Look, I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce in the house

Up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're banging on ya baby OG's

Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's fast
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But it's steel, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Hey yo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket
And make a loot, niggas want trip
Spitting like ""you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit""
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say
""it's the wagy to get paid"", DP's and pay
I don't know why you want to get on my back? (why?)
Tripping 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you should of roll
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from Seth be trying to set you 'cause you setting your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Just what we need, banging on wax another trip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mother-ship?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
Cause, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missing
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossing
But guess what it cost em, they crossing me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

[Chorus: Repeats]",Up Jump Tha Boogie
Snoop Dogg,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big Turkish wole with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flaunting and won't it speaking
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb with the beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down wit his starks untied
And a blue and gray cap that said the east-side
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nothing but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass transform wit finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at the V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offering him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussing

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after getting rejected, I ain't running upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-see straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listening to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
""We used to see Daz, back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors
You got the papers",Vapors

",When I Grow Up
Snoop Dogg,"[Soopafly]
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoes
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agree, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and giving up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a home run
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin bout the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where 
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me
   
You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass
Like a pimp and that's for real
   
[Snoop Dogg]
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Want to grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they want to do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang
That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby
   
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
Trick bitch, bitch
   
[Too Short]
I said bitch, what are you smoking
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the east-side
How much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money
   
You thought you had my grip
But Too Short never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
Trick bitch bitch

The dog saw 'im...they tear...they...looked liked they try to tear him off.
I said ""Oh my God! They want to eat my husband

[Verse 1:]
I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Sparky-O was playin basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, why'all about to squab my Doggz
Dirty ???? gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble...Friday 'cause that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
And ain't no need to reach for heat 'cause you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
'cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
'cause I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-do and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week why'know what? She bit the shit out of me
???? bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for why'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just....

[Hook:]
Me & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz

[Verse 2:]
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko 'cause he go taken my swim
I think 'cause my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's 'cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see

And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo, 
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes

Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on, 
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see 
or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang,
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop
Have prestigious women 
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the fliest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind, 
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind

Snoop Dogg,"Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed 
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being 
Shot

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed 
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit
Some out the projects dumb shit
Some weed and blunt shit
Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit
Some penitentiary solitary confinement 
Never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor 
I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick door
Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down??? do get scared 
I ain't flipped till my guns smoking
It be a hustle just to eat  
And it be hard on these streets

At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade

I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy dogg is chilling in a benz
In front of his building with the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.
Do my ears deceive me
No that's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear 
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs 
And come home like a slob
So here comes dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new

Hmm
Money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everyhing is cool
I pull about a g a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55"" television you know
And every once in a while I hear ""just say no""
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accellerater scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was warren
Later I found it was dogg and his crew

I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
""ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue

Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know

He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to it
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing 
So we all said ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into 
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's

Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain

Tryin' to find all your dope, cause your a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cause times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to lose
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some

Hook it up like Master P (Ughh)

An I ain't even trip, when you dip wit them chips off the dresser
An you didn't even have to fess up
I just gave you another G, an told you ""pick ya dress up""
For the wedding, the setting was set
40 G's for your ring, you's a Queen sipping Moet
I'm upset, an I don't even want to have jip out
But baby didn't give it to me, 
I was down at the alter, I seen Sister Salta
Said ""lady could you pray for me?"" 
I'm in a love affair, I can't share, it ain't fair
Because my life is my wife, an that ain't right
Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, an what I was choose to do
Whether it's buying a house, or car, or some clothes for you
I try to stay true to it, see I ain't new to it
That's why I do for you boo, I need love too, three

You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone} 
You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone} 
You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone} 
You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone} 

See I done put it on the line, see this here is genuine
An as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine
See can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it
This love affair, it's so original, I call it classic
See I'm attracted, an I'm infatuated
At the same time, belated, an gang related, Dogg Pound on mine
But to fine time to leave all that behind
An trying to spend some time an give you all of mine 
{what's that} ya see
I ain't hard to get along with, 
To do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
An, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit me
Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner
Just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}

You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone} 
You don't show me some love 
{show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}
You gets no loving babe 
{you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it till it's gone}",Show Me Love
Snoop Dogg,"[Chorus]
Slow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down

It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Oh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

[Snoop]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking 
I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all want to come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas
Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
Hey yo Snoop (I used to)
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then stone em out
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money
Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad, but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

[Snoop]
I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun
I squad from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't want to get caught up in my mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't never ever, talk no shit
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit

Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the haters
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)
Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat
Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets
Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat
(Slow down) Slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas",Slow Down

Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment
Niggas that's havin' shit, and if you ain't roll on and stroll on
This is the spot were the bangers at, the slangers at

In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did 
Provide an opportunity in the community,
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me
Since IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something

Ain't too many places that you know about
So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house

Picture me ballin' (ballin')
3rd world hustler out the ghetto of New Orleans
Some say life is like a fairy tail (fairy tail)
Did a song with Snoop Dogg, and it turned into a business deal
But it ain't bout da ends, cus we all got matches and we all got benz's
It's about riddin' with the homies (homies)
Gettin rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies

Bitches wouldn't even look at me, y'knahmsayin? (Yeah you!)
They just want a nigga to bust a rap about 'em, y'know (Yeah you!)
Buy 'em sometin' to eat from...IHOP, y'know
Go get 'em a Big Mac value pack or sumthin'...
But uh...I'm a tell you what I really remember the most about these bitches, cuz
(What chu remember, dawg?)

I remember Rachel, Tina, Lisa, and Grace
Cause every single one of them had a special place in my heart
From the start, see I was just a young puppy
A young dummy, panties, bitches to fuck with me
Now that I grew up and blew up, I look back
And thanked [thought] on these hoes, they straight to' up, know what?
I'm in effect for the nine-eight
See now I'm scared of love, like my homeboy Nate
And I don't wanna hurt no mo'...so...
I rather go to the Mo' with a ho and leave my rubber on the flo' (What?!)
And call my nigga, Sean Dizzay
To come scoop me up in the cut, Dogg, nigga, what, chy'all? (What, what, what)
Ain't knowin? Pimpin' and ho-in'
Keep the grass growin', ""Nigga, where you goin'?""
Look here bitch, don't ask me shit
Did I interupt you while [*slurping noises*] you was sucking my dick, beyotch?
I don't need the stress, besides talkin' back to a pimp would get yo ass slapped
Respect the GAME (GAME), and I promise you the game gon' do the motherfuckin' same
I learned a whole lot from these bitches of my past
A bitch with no class is worse than a bitch with no ass
And you wonder why I'm from The Pound?
Shiiiit, if a bitch can't swim, nigga, she bound to drown, nigga

It was all on a ho, what chu trippin' fo', nigga?
It was all on a ho, Gs' up, hoes down, what chu trippin' fo'? (What chu trippin' for'?)
It was all on a ho, why you trippin', dawg? Hoes down, Gs' up
It was all on a ho, what chu trippin fo', ya heard? Gs' up, hoes down, it was all on a ho

It was Nineteen-motherfuckin'-Ninety Three
Me and Sean Dogg in the CPT
And we fuckin' with these fuckin' mob bicthes he know
And the one named Kiki, she's so kinky
Said she loved my video, so you know where we goin here
Now she feelin' freaky, and wanna braid my hair
So I sit back, relax, and let her twist
And put my head back on a pound of fish ?????
(Wait a minute!) Wait a minute! Let me hit it!
""Nah! I ain't even trippin' let me get some head in the kitchen
And keep dippin'"", Then I looked in the living room and
See my nigga Sean Dogg bitch straight trippin'
So, you know what's next..(What up?)..no sex!
Pull out cha dick and bust a nut on her dress, (Say what?) (Word!)
Like Billy Clinton, we representin'
For all you women, bitches, keep swimmin'
We never save 'em and that's on The Pound
Cause if the bitch can't swim, she bound to drown, nigga

It was all on a ho, hoes down, yeah (hooooooooooooooo)
It was all on a ho, G's up, yeah, Hoes down, hoes down (hooooooooooooooo)
Hoes' down, (hoooooooooooooooooooo), yeah
It was all on a ho, Gs' up, hoes down, Gs' up
It was all on a ho, it was all on a ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
It was all on a ho, Gs' up, hoes down, Gs' up, if a bitch can't swim, she's bound to drown
Check it out, y'all, Checka-checka-check it out, y'all
It was all on a ho, yeah, I need everybody out there to say this shit wit' me, c'mon

Now can I get a hooooooooooooooo (hooooooooooooooo)
Say hooooooooooooooo (hoooooooooooooo)
Lemme hear you say ho, ho, ho! (Ho, ho, ho!)
Everybody...ho, ho, ho! (Ho, ho, ho!)

Snoop Dogg,"Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the pen
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playing football up in Powly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rapping much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strapping up
Hell motherfucking yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Dripping on my memories, twisted off my music
Trying to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And East-side niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them West-side niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cause, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fucking with this hood-rat that he met up in dance
Betty getting mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you living for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now

Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way

(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(Yeah, better days ahead)
Better days ahead
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead

That's real.
I feel your pain nigga.
I used to be just like you nigga.
Before I got off in this rap shit.
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.
You know, but one thing I never did do.
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man.
Better days ahead my nigga.
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.
Cause I'm a get mine regardless.
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets.
I gotta have it.",Betta Days
Snoop Dogg,"You ain't trying to hot box with me, I swing hard liquor
Going down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backing down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk driving, trying to stack my loot
While other rappers getting ""Treated Like a Prostitute""
So check the SoundScan

All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breaking off these motherfuckin keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin G's, ha!
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this

Oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezee bay-bay
You jocking my style? ""You so cra-zy""
Dre say, ain't ""No Limit"" to this
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it ""Doggystyle""
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln Continental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Ask the bitches in your hood cause they know

Bitch please! Get down on your god damn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed
Look, you fuckin with some real O.G's

Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dough (f'real)
Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks
Oh, you like setting niggas up and getting them loc's?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (well hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg I'm movin!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin
You've been waiting on a nigga like me
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang BANG!)
I'm trying to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho

She acting like that hair's hers but you know what's up
Say she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""
But guess who's calling, Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my who ride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo 
But I can't forget about him cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walking down the wrong lane
Tooting on that cocaine, fucking wit that wrong thing
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit 
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce

Now if you're doing for your family and you can't stand it
Cause you know these motherfuckers trying take advantage
Say they doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a motherfucking different stroke
Say he doing too much, yeah Joey you doing too much

We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style
We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharing the cock
Also, I believe in comparing the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Oh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta
But my homey fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist

Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doing too much, yeah homey you doing too much
And when the homey in the pen, doing a sin
And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend
Say she doing too much, hell yeah she doing too much

I'm living up in the hills, wine sipping wit mills
I'm having major type of paper, I ain't tripping off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. spray
Friends and family, getting after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note
You doing too much when you clutching on my touch-tone
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power
And only get to hit a cold shower
You faking like you're making more moves than Simpson
But fronting, pushing buttons, doing nothing but sin

And when a nigga on yo' phone, running up yo' bill
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much
And when your baby momma crying bout she need some milk
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt
You know she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much

Put me up on game, your homie
It was too much fun, hm, remember what you told me

No baby I ain't with the bullshit

You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Yay kiss and a rub back and now I'm up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that hoe squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that hoe
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself

Yo' whats up, whats up.

Alright, alright. 
Y'all get my ash tray, get my lighter. 
I'm a read y'all a gangsta bedtime story. 
Come here, sit on my lap. 
(Okay.)
Check it out.

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision getting blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a motherfucking Vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrespecting my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood getting hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eating on a Kit Kat 
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nothing at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this motherfucker cause
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns 
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip 
To a motherfucking' nine millimeter for heater 
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back 
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight",G Bedtime Stories

I made you cry, you made me smile
I just want to say I love you for life
and that's the reason why I'm here now
Love, Snoop

I love my momma, yeah,

Momma, momma, momma, momma, I love my momma
Momma, I love you momma

Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song
(she was in love)
A gangsta love song, you feel me?  Check it out
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)

Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl, why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growing up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thing, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rolo, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thing last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She loving a nigga, steady buying me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buying me house shoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug

[Chorus: x2]

(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta

I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too
What you gon' do?  ""You know I'm goin' stay true
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to""
Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short
On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slipping, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways
She fell in love with the local G
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

Snoop Dogg,"Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy running to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!""
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""
Well, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were going, they were getting down
Even Pops was going for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted 
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped 
(well alright!)
The princess was staring, while holding a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, ""Hello!  Hi!""
Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!""
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swinging from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denying that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feeling pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Saying, ""Wasn't that you?  Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept asking me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked
She said she was looking for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearing shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!""
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry

Lookin like he need some love
And everytime I see him, he been givin me the eye

And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel
Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
Now baby got a gown on, getting her clown on
As she slid downstairs, now she taking me down home
Cheating in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong?  Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shaking poo-poo, what would you do?
Trust is a motherfucking loco, shit
And so is temptation, and I don't know what I'ma do
Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)

I mean will like livin' it up, you know
Bang to that boogie and boogie to that bang
That sound of mi Nina when she feel that need to sang

I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now
Not to mention that homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now that road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hood rats, snakes

'Cause E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil' homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin' of thirst
Stayin' at his girls spot on 21st

And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
'Cause he might not make it to tha last verse
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style

Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
We straight bangin

[Chorus: x4]

This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right
What you join tha game for you lil busta
Now you want to cross us out and disrespect us

Must of thought we was bustas or somethin'
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
That's that one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you goin' gang bang

Ya gots to be able to bang like yourself man
So whether you bangin' for crip or blood
You better bang for somthin' young thug
'Cause you'll get banged on not by bangas

But by Johnny Law 'cause they love to hang us I hear ya
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch

I can't trip 'cause she look like my daughter and shit
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high
And every police car that I see ridin by
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid

Drinkin' to that set and hope my dog young have head
Throwin' up DPG for L-I-F-E 'cause that's all I see
Wit love for the LB

Snoop Dogg,"[Snoop Dogg]
Uhh..
Sittin in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggaz plotin to get, uhh
Cause if it's me, it's on
Loc, the Esse wit the black knights just got stoned
And then he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch or his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
and left him with two black guys
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch lookin they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin if I'm slippin in these County Blues

[Chorus]
Niggaz fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin, if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's a steady rainology

What are fools always wonderin?

Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets, lick

Boy when you get out you betta not never come back
I tell you that'll make a punk hard
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Esse's is deep
And it look like they strait tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Dabbity Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
You ran out on the brotha's
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a hoe (you'se a hoe)

Always stay down and keep my muthafuckin' game tight
'Cause ever since elementary or was it pre-school, cool
I was a muthafuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank they selves
For fuckin' with my wealth
And it'll catch on
'Cause if it don't it's on
And 'cause I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me it's on
And it's the same old song
Niggas paper so long
So if you want me, get me , got me
But now they call me Snoop Gotti

Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
But I wasn't slippin' I was on deck

With no remorse, I had to take him out
Dead, gone, lights out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the Dogg I take your life and your money
And now I dip to my spot
And bet nobody speak on the 8-7
And set up shop with yo rocks

Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G

People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense and make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't have to play funny
But I got yo honey up under my wing
'Cause she like that song that the bow wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on a hoe stroll make me
And even if she never saw me befo'
Theres just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

[Chorus]",Hit Rocks
Snoop Dogg,"[Technique] 
By dawn's early light 
I shine brighter than the stars in the night 
And 'bout ready for a fight 
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice 
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon 
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun 
I'm torching hot and all the same 
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein 
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown 
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome 
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me 
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now? 
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow 
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step 
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck 
High profile, but my style low-pro 
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O. 
And I blow the best indo, that you know of 
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love 
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now 
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle 
[Technique] 
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee? 
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me 
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof 
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth 
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last? 
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash 
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now 
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang 
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game 
He so sprung, on top of that he young 
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold 
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees 
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies 
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game 
Now they 'bout to take him out the game 
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go 
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ?? 
[Chorus]: Kurupt,(Snoop),  
I'd rather not get shot 
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots 
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all DPG (DPG) 
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy 
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive 
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it's all DPG (DPG) 
[Technique] 
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted 
But I'm unlisted in the books 
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW! 
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win 
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end 
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green 
And all my life I got advice from a superior team 
I gotta stay away from the casket 
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted 
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso- 
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e

Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial 
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials 
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it 
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic 
Have you ever heard? 
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof 
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft 
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash, 
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash 
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime 
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime? 
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs 
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone 
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone

Snoop Dogg,"Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump? 
And who got the bump that ya thump? 
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump 
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up 
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in 
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in 
I got the motion, the potion 
And once hit the groove everything is in motion 
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around 
And all of my homies on lock down, we keep it underground 
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound 
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin? 
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions 
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso 
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo 
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code 
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know 
Who started with me, who departed with me 
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's 
Regardless, let's see with biphocles, let's try the locals 
And why'all wonder why they despise my vocals 
I fooled you like crystals, rap spittin like lips do 
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool 

[Chorus:] 
May I (may... I), may I funk with you? 
(repeat x4) 
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola 
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola 
Now that I got older, I got a little colder 
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder 
Million dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney 
A bowlie for Snoop Doggy 
Ain't no follow-up, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so orignal 
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger 
But that's the little homie, I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone 
Spit three words up in lightning 
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you like it 
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my fo-do' 
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey photo 
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car 
The Double are from the Durwood store 

[Chorus:] 
Well in verse three, the worst see? 
After part two, know when I stop the clock there be a heart, too 
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do, 
I thought you knew we bust 
I demolish, stay polished, no time to rust 
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luthor 
Cause ya see ain't no loser 
that can get the scoop on the supa-dupa Snoop 
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics 
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers 
You know I isn't the bomb digga-dee, bomb-beeze 
They can't get with the D-O double G 
You no MC slash master of ceramonies 
Runnin thangs, pullin strings callin Snoop pesky 
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me 
Don't want to test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?

I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Spanky-Loc was playin basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, why'all about to squab my Doggz
Dirty Red gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble...Friday 'cause that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
And ain't no need to reach for heat 'cause you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
'cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
Cuzz I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-do and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week why'know what? She bit the shit out of me
Man this bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for why'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just....

But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko 'cause he go taken my swim
I think 'cause my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's 'cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-Dead
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit

Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other -
Way, just play and say what you want to say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
'cause niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
'cause I'ma tell ya, watch them niggas,
'cause them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care 'cause they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin, they gettin you and gettin away
Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-why-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all realated
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game piece from me to why'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
why'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

It's a Sunday a fun day, one day
Away from Monday, and all day ain't no gunplay
And everything is alright outside (why)
'Cause [unknown] put his speech down and got all the brothers to ride

For one cause, and that's how it is why'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught

If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease

[Daz Dillinger]
When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him with gangit kinds of money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he say

He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house

[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Get you money, size team (uh)

Get you money man
(He was out to get paid)
Get you money man (Poor Tommy)
Get you money man (Me and Snoop on his team)

(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (get you money man)
Get you money man (Get you money man)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him

They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away 'cause he was just to fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash

Get it, get it, get it, 'cause ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way you got's to
'Cause this is somethin' to rock to

[Daz]
Man, we sacked up dollars and Caddies,
Omiscious muggin' 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin' shit,

And never wantin' to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be acquitted (young nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy,
Ridin' on big ballers for a pastime hobby
So if ya havin' money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team

And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say ""spray em"", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG,
or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

[Daz (Snoop Dogg)]
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid
(get you money man.. get you money man..)

(get you money man.. get you money man..)
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
Me and Snoop still on his team, big pimps gettin paid
We was down with big Tommy

(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man..)
Check me out now man

[Daz]
We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass,
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share

A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it was off the hook you know
We had everything from Indo to blow (What, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin'

So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin' to say, to say, to say...

[Tommy talking]
Aye look here mayne,
What some people won't do for money
Yea I had these two niggas that was on my team
You know, down with me like the Grey Tape

It's always the niggas that's closest to ya,
That be the ones that try to get you, you know what I'm sayin'
Shit I heard these ladies the other day say that pimpin' was dead
I said not in my bed bitch 

Ah-ha, that's real, I'll put that on my fiz-sound

Do you think it is by accident that everytime
a black leader appears on the horizon
with any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?
Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself
And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard
All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detached from us, these are only for you

Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
so cold should... gotta do wrong

(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
The world is filled with so much jealousy
You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot

(Snoop Dogg)
You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'ma give it to you - live and direct
Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
from L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)
Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it
Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited
So come on down and party with the pound (come on)
You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down
Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers
guaranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper
Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'
I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it
And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion
It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians

Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two)
I gots to do ya, like ya never been done
It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1
I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all
Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me

I don't know who to trust cause 
If I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm)

I turn to the left and I turn to the right
I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?)
What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the glock?
I knocks on the door, plus ""Oh No""
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'ma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm committed to do it and I'm a still acquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guaranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'ma give you people what you need
And I'ma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guaranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
guaranteed to make the hoe's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled ""The Real McCoy""
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guaranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up
I'm guarnteed to, do my thing
Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing
What'cha want to do, what ya gots to
Cause this is somethin' to rock you

Back in the days when I was on the wrong tracks
At an early age man

(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-moma's house 
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfucking first telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up cause she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and applause
And I put my hand on my balls and said what's up dog

[Chorus]

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperon plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Top cat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fucking with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt (bitch!)

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
With trumped up charges against my client
Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For 227 counts of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
With trumped up charges against my client
Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For 357 counts of verbal and reckless endangerment

From the million dollar mouthpiece
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused
And shook up, like a pair of dice

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
Charging my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines
With the intent to pimp the system

Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before twelve G's and open up his files
And you will see that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up, ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension

So all you jerks with them eleven dollar words
Comin' out of your two dollar mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack, I said

He's a five-star guerilla Crip with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin' for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle

To grant a motion of 995 grounds of dismissal

So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me,

Gettin' interviewed by motherfuckers like geraldo,
And niggas wanna know if I smoke newports or marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make that shit for the realest of millions,
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',
And oh what a relief it is,
That snoop is back in dis motherfucker handlin' his biz,
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,
Fuck these niggaz and peep out whitey ro,
Somebody told? well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,

Ask them hoes over there, ""y'all wanna fuck snoop?"" (yeah!)

Stop whinin' just to cry and get the mackin' daddy

Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again

Two days later, I'm running my mouth
Mom's put a bottle to my grill
I look her in the face and I say chill
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital
On my way to the liquor store
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
First trip in the police car
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me

You'z a fool fo' dis, yeah

7 dizzles a wizzle, Bigg Bow Wiggle's, up in the hizzle
Fo' shizzle bizzle, here we go again

Freshly dressed, I jump up in the mo'nin' tryna find some Zest
Psyche, we like the Bom, somebody betta ring the alarm
And hit the folks at the forum
Let my homies off the yard
I shall see the head nigga in charge
Push... Bush outta office, dump 'til they get off us
Make them offers, that leave niggas in coffins

[Goldie Loc]
Can you feel it my nigga, I'm 'bout to kill it my niggas
Sound like guerillas, fo' real'a off gangsta government millas
Coke killas, when it comes to off mic'n wit me
I was branded in a gang, fuck havin' techniques
Just ride, not a damn lettin' these fools breathe
Pop peas, push keys, find a stash fo' yo cheese
Is it possible that laws might get jealous
Hell yeah they be hatin' on the 3 Good Fellas

[Tray Deee]
Over-dosage of ferocious, WestCoast in effect
Bang straight gangsta shit, so you know it's on deck
Hold and respect, cold as it get, don't wanna test
Kidnap ya wife and ya kids, you get the message
Insanity, commanded me to savagely spit
Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it quick
No talkin', see-Walkin', we chokin' the block off
Lettin' the glock off
And throwin' up DoggHouse

Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta
If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata

[Tray Deee]
We exploded, reloaded and sewed it up
Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump
Keep this mothafucka jumpin' 'til they close it up
Then we dippin' wit a sip and some hoes to fuck
Pour late, the hard way, ain't no bustas here
So explict you can only get it once a year
Eastsidaz, the ridaz, they change the game
And let you know from here go, we straight came to bang

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]
Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you
Ever see someone here, who gave a fuck about you?
Niggas on the streets gon' keep talkin' shit about you
As long as you clap fool, it's bigger than 'bout too
Fuck wit fools, that ain't never paid us
And try to turn the homies into traitaz
Blue rags with blue balls, fo' all you hataz

Snoop Dogg,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs

Takin thangs into my own hands

But life a twist ya like a twister
Get twisted with this
It seems on but its off
I keep missin this shit
I'm high but i try, to stay focused wide out
Lookin dead at the chips
I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on but i can't let go
Smokin on my last breath
Blow out life what's left is death
Now i can go on or i can g or make a right
Whatever way that i turn its still death after life
It don't discourage me, i ain't got nuthin to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But i learn 'cause i see, and i earn 'cause i g
But these problems probably havin niggaz prayin to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
And i'm tryin to keep my sanity god help me please

Mischeavius and devious is how my life was
Puttin the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed
Some of the money makin muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin about a jack move tryin to whoo-ride
Gettin jealous 'cause my music got this rap game sewn up
Them niggaz want to trip whatever back they get blowed up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play those muthafuckaz i'll always not
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
don't be fuckin wit my niggaz on the midnight shift
Shit shiggy shack, gettin it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known for servin more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin for the music from the night before
Trouble 1, he layin low all in gettin that dough

Havin cars and bitches on a proper amount

All around it my life won't change for the good
As soon as i walk out the door, i'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me,
Hey yo daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me
The tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin for dumb shit
The ogs think then brung guns to control shit
Every midnight i be loaded, high as a kite
Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight
And a lot a mob puttin on mo
Problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo
But sure i did the record blast five times

Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the president
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (bitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the top dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinking they goin' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the ""world's most dangerous group""  N.W.A.

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talking shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e

So what you need is some game to get your money man
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nuttin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin' up with lint

So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin' funny
Stop smilin', 'cause still don't nuttin' move but the money
'Cause now I've learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just

Search for a 9 to 5, and if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cause man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, 'cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream

'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the dogghouse, 'cause I'm paid in full

I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champagne with a bowl of cavier
Hell yea you are, yeah you are
Say it say it, cause they all deny it
Player play it, cause you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thing we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

Like a rose, flipping down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)

Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Cause my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song

This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there
That might have been in love before
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)
But uh, it's true
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)
It's hard to replace that special someone
When they just up and you know
Dip dive and so socialize
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)
We goin' kick something over this HiTek beat right here
For all the players that lost somebody special
And wonder where she at
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)

[E. White]
I got my eyes wide open
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg
I bet my name all around your wall
Perhaps I went to jail
That left us out of touch
Shoulda shot some mail or something
Ain't no telling where she at now
I be God damn
Baby I really want to see what you got now
I'm all grown up with my shit together
I don't know if I'mma see you ever
I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this
You at the top of my list
Unforgetable
Fuck with them nigga do

But in the mean time I'mma get with cha
Until I get somebody with your hook up Imma hit ya

I miss that bitch
She was a pot of gold
Her body was cold
I don't know where you went
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)
Shopping around looking around
I'm try to see
Where could you be
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)

[Snoop]
My momma got mad 
I was young when I hooked up with her
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin
A long lasting relationship 
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit
I used to break you down just to roll you up
You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)

[Chorus]

You play too much, I had to fuck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbing your stuff and now your pants full of nut
You can't tell me nothing
Let me shoot my thing on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your home girl want some, I just might bank her
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll

If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
Hov ain't into backwards macking
How backwards that is
I don't love 'em though
'Less making a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneaking in the club with the toast
I'm flying the friendly skies with 36 hoes
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me

I was juz told
You get your freedom
By telling you're enemy
That
You'll do anything to get you're freedom
Then you'll get it
Its the only way you'll get it
When you get that kinda attitude
Then they label you as a crazy negro
Or they'll just call you a crazy nigga
They dun say negro
Or they'll call you an extremest or a subversive 
Or a sedetiast
Or a red or a radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you 
You'll get your freedom
So dun run around here trying
To to make friends with someone who will deprive you of you're rights
There not you're friends
No, there you're enemy's
And treat them like that
And fight them
And you'll get you're freedom
And after you get you're freedom you're enemy will respect you
And well respect you
And I say that with no hate
Cause I dun have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So I say to you
Big man I'm the man you think you are
If you want to no what ill do
Figure out what you'll do and ill do the same only more of it

In the world of change, here I am
Trying to have some things
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Oh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

[Snoop Dogg]
A day in the life, of a Rollin 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism
Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww no, Dogg ain't this y'all
I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real be	-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, be	-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace

He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big neck bone
Mauseberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had show some love
Now back to the scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you being jealous bout what I does
cause I does it the most, the King of The Coast, in a Pink Plaint Pos
I back ya down like Shack Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wiltshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't pull my hoe card
I fucked all your groupies, when you was doing time and kept Snoopy
With the fags & snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was paying niggas off of all my riches
You so hard caught, why ain't you go to level 4? Oh I know (bitch)
But I walk the main line every time I go down
You can check my G Files, I do it LBC style
I got the word on ya Simon (Simon), you need to just start rhyming
cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table, you're not able
To compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for One-Eight-Seven On A Cop
I started yo shit, and I'll end yo shit
If you keep talking shit on Crip

And I'll be spending money out the anus

Man you worser than devils
A lot of niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cause I'll fuck every last one of em up, especially Kurupt
See that's my lil' homeboy, so he knows what's up
He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas tripping, this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it
So put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

Many people know we know about this pimp game
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game
And to me it ain't no motherfucking thing
To give it to you plain and simple cause you know its played
Holla at 'em doggy dogg, go and do that thing

Rollin with a player cause that's what he was
And dedicated to his paper, G's up
On his bitches hard as fee's up
And if the law-boys pull him over he wont freeze up
He got the heeta fa heeta in the keys-ah
With a pocket full of big-faced visa's
They say its cheaper to keep her now baby ease up,
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up.
And now sit your ass in the trees-ah
And do me a favor and turn the music up.
Should I slap her, or should I freak-ah
I'll take the strong and you can have the weak-ah.
Speak when spoken to

And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you.

I had, 3 on my right arm, and 4 on my left
Lime n green n gold who was sharp to death
Had to catch my breath, watch my step.
Playing this game, you can holla at the ref.
And call a time-out
Before you put your dime out.
Stop, pause, rewind, before you put your rhyme out.
And go to the Wizard of Oz
To tell him that you are trying to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
Cause you realized you had never played your part
And that was smart.
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state.
See, I've been the fliest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it homie I just shake n bake.
I wont fake to make you by my take
I say a prayer to my Lord just to keep my faith
Fuck straight.

Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)

Big Snoop Dogg let you know
That this game aint for no lame.
If you got heart, you can play this game.
But if your heart aint right,

Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby

Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next

And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two

(​I love, to give you light)

Yeah, first of all
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers and gangbangin'
And dope dealin', cold feelin' to be a product of niggas around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin'
I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin' the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggas throwin' up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin' my home, not carin' 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin'
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin' just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you

And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked down
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin' thangs, ha ha
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin' to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say neighbor! You ain't going!
You ain't going!",(Intro) I Love to Give You Light

I'ma do you a favor, let this pimping save ya
Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior
Boy you move too fast, done too much talking
I'm too much walking to one who keep hoes hawking
Don't fuck with Snoop too much cause he goes off when
Niggas mouth too much, so please no flossing
I step up quicker, cause the game don't pause
I gotta stay sucker free, cause it ain't no laws
Dig this y'all

I had to tell you the truth homey, but you got mad
Yeah I hurt yo' feelings, FUCK IT, it's too damn bad
I'm a major player, I got major game
I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin the same
I ain't got time for no haters, I lay 'em flat on they back
I'm from the Dogg Pound homey, I don't fuck with them cats
I fuck with, niggas, who be busting them shots
I'm talking Long Beach, Inglewood, Compton, Watts
Close your chops, I knows your spots
Keep talking nigga I'll expose your knots

I'm not a, holy roller but I pray so hard
Help me, I'm sending these bitch niggas straight to God

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes

You can't control your hoe? (She hardheaded, she just won't obey)
Can you control your hoe? (You've got to know what to do, and what to say)
You've got to put that bitch in her place, even if it's slapping her in her face.
Ya got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe? 

I went to your house, 
Your girl came in and started cussing you out. 
You should have slapped her
In her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place. 
I kept it on the low, cause I know you
Was gonna check that hoe. 
But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it
Wasn't your house. 
Cause she was acting like a nut, 
You got a kind of bitch that would kick your butt. 
What kind of pimp holds back? 
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap, what's wrong with
The pimpin'? Why you get a whippin'? 
All I got to say is this

This is what you made me do; 
I really didn't want to put hands on you. 
But bitch you playin'
With fire, I'm so sick and tired, 
Of loud mouth bitches like you, 
A nigga had to go and put tips
On you, cause bitch you playin' with fire, 
I'm so sick and tired. 
This is what you forced me to do, 
I really didn't want to put hands on you,

And slide in it, real smooth like
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you goin' let a nigga have a look at it?

That people are the same, they all share the same fears
Share the same tears, and I over the years

And hold onto what I have can you dig that?
And what I do, I do for the benefit of me and my kids
Dig that, 
Talk to me

I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thing on me 

Its something kind of funny
How the man take your money
Be sure as he can be
Its such a way you'll never see
Its a terrible thing inside

What we can't turn to dope
And put all aside the hope

Twinkling tinkling (?brings, blings, binds?)
We do all sorts of things
While you're in a modest place
Your conciouses only peace
Yeah I had to make peace with myself you know what I mean
I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So I told myself I want to know what it feels like to be high fo life
And I mean man I tell ya it feels real good 
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother I'm telling you its a great feeling 
Can you dig that
I can dig it
More and more you grieve

Until you grow another need 
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality

I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc using donors, dead niggas with spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark
Niggas never see the light till it spark
Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push Me, a hundred revolvers'll get to spinning

Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me, when you want to get splifted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!

Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it

Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded

Wings are under all your clothes
You worth more than your weight in gold
Where did God put down your mole
Or were you only made for show?
Girl you're perfect, when God made you
I wonder if he kept the mold, or are you just for show?
Girl you're perfect, when I see you
It takes my mind to cloud nine, girl you're so fine, yeah - hey

I love, to give you light

Geah, first of all, givin' honor to God and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?

Sing it sister yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this are and G
The Masterpiece such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginning as a child, I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball

As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers and gangbangin'

And dope dealin', cold feelin' to be a product of niggaz around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin'
I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often

With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs

Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin' up
Disrespectin' my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin'
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin'

Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light

I've grown, to comprehend the game my name is
Big Snoop Boss Dogg just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin' just what I practice

To each and all, I got a word from the beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you

I love, to give you light

And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked down
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha

I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
'Cause a lot of y'all think, y'all goin' to heaven, huh
And you ain't gon' go, so I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say neigh-bor, you ain't goin' you ain't goin'

Snoop Dogg,"If I didn't have no dough, would you love me?

Hey yo Dunc, who dat girl standing there like dat?

Pretty toes in a row, they lookin' like OO

I don't know nephew, let's do what we do
Let's just slide up on these hoes and put this pimpin' to use
And then what what we do, what we do
You take the one in the white, I'll take the one in the blue

If I didn't have no dough, would you love me?

But you look like you should be gold
You're so precious, the way you shape up
I'm just here to help you step your game up

You look like a dime right from here
You can dive in half of the bullet and die for me
'cause you can fly, you be fly, you can fly with me
And when I fly another country, you can fly with me

If I didn't have no dough, would you love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be there?
Would you leave me alone if the chips were down?
Would you stay around and be down? Oh girl

An' I ain't tellin' her where to stay an' where to go

An if she want we can take a trip down
With the hommie D O double G
An he from Longbeach, I'm from a little town
An' it's low key, guess who where tha crown

If I didn't have no dough, would you love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be there?
Would you leave me alone if the chips are down?
Would you stay around and be down? Oh girl

Won't let no b**** n****z close to me
From my head to my feet, I'm protected from harm
'Cause I'm a muthaf***ing shining star; you feel me?
And f*** who want to kill me
You n****z thrill me, but guess what will be
On top tip top, non-stop, dogg not

And youse a flea, and

The one nigga is chilly, as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' in macks, makin' 'em G stacks
And got them corn rows to the back

Ninety doin' fakin' with kissin' on the couchin'
Boo to the ouchin', more a fountain

You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a player, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love each other
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up

Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck cous', and him too cause all y'all suckers
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my yellow see's at night nigga

We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

I'm a Bad Boy, with a lotta ho's
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun so you want to pop back?
AK47 now nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to
Subscribe nigga, get yo issue
Baby come close, let me see how you get loose!

I'm a mother fucking gangsta nigga
I still make moves and smoke weed with thug niggas 
I love you niggas, my drug dealin' days in the past 
But I never hesitate to kick a dumb dumb niggas ass 
I call shots just like I was the last don 
You heard a tru records bitch that's mine 
My shits hot, not even all the ice in the north pole 
Could make my mother fucking rhymes cold 
And I'm ghetto like a bitch tradin' food stamps for cash, huh 
I'm about to score another bag 
And I speak with a mother fucking slur when I talk 
And I still do that mother fucking gangsta walk

Gang gang gang gang gang gangsta (walk) 
Gang gang gang gang gang gangsta (do the gangsta walk)

You know my apperal, double barrel with the hollow points 
My young homie in the back seat he swollowin' joints 
When the po-lice get after, we dippin' on three wheels 
Cup filled to the rim feather in my brim, headed to a party in the lbc 
No limit soldiers with the dpg 
When me and my homeboys step into the house
All the bitch ass niggas start breakin' out cause you know 
They know whas up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts 
Like her but she keep cryin', I got a boyfriend, bitch stop lyin' 
Punk ass hooker ain't nuthin' but a dyke,
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like 
Cripped out ripped out flipped out they dipped out

And sometimes I gotta bust a nut, and sometimes I won't 
Check it, from the crips to the bloods to the niggas sellin' drugs 
Yet niggas pimp hoes in the mother fucking clubs 
I'm the 'g' in gangsta 
The nigga that'll hang ya, the ship that'll sink ya 
And the bullet that'll bang ya 
I'm the hour in a clock, I'm the high on the rock
I'm the last mother fucker you would ever want to stop bitch 
I'm rich, fuck rap, I'll preach then have your bitch ass workin for me 
I hit ya with a 187, I'll shank ya 
'cause I'm a mother fucking gangsta nigga

Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
Till the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real

To those people who don't believe in G-funk
Tried to take my style and make a quick buck
here's a message to one and all
Your pass is revoked
Now I'm havin' a ball
Any questions come and see me
the king of  G-Funk the one and only
Congratulations you sound like Nate
You took my old hook 
And got me paid

Some people are nothin' but clones
Some people have styles of their owm
Some people are copycats
These people can't get the mic back
Can you feel me one-hitter quitters
You can't copy me, I'm one in a million
Call any expert and you can ask him
Copy machines can't copy platinum

We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

I'm sittin' here trippin'
My mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock
No one can do it better like this 2 man crew
They say we're one hit quitters
So what cha'll gonna do?

Always into somethin', that's my name
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who has the most is he who won the match

Strike one
Me and Nate Dogg is a match
Stike two
Leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three
You can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see

Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you think you really wanna step to me
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby
So I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now

All you pimp playin' hustlers, now ya know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me

Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted
I think you found out and got jealous
Cause I was diggin' your bitch
And runnin' back tellin' all the fellas
But you took her home
And wanted to marry the bitch
I would dig her in this, mister
And bury the bitch

Came at a nigga wrong
Little cavity creep walkin' around with Nikes on
Bitch ass nigga ain't got no heart
Be ready to finish anythin' your punk ass started

Been around the world
I've been into many places
Seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby, none of them compare to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

[Verse 1]
I seen everything twice
Been around the world, I've seen every scene twice
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my candy
I'm sorta like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy
Sippin' Chardinae, making deals with my hands free

It feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
Coast-to-coast jetting, man, I been doing that
What you do, just start balling? I been around the track
Hop in Peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
Docking down in Manico, churching with my folks
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat
My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammy's
But these streets won't say a goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks

To the hood goodbye

[Verse 1]
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy""
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me, 
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot, man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live... In the streets

Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop Dogg]
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion
With some whites, some asians and persians
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains
She say she wanna be an actress
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action!
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, ""One Love""
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop Dogg]
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it
Get some menage, durin' every visit
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy

1992, d cover hit the world
And fell in love with snoop
Doggystyle came out it's like I dropped the bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time

Got owned and I brought the whole pound with me
Didn't matter who's around I kept it way to G
Niggas know it was eastside LBC
Gangsta shit

Swimin' with the sharks
And I almost drowned

To become the G I am today
Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't going nowhere
Only I ain't ever comin' down
I'm too high in the cloud
To ever have to worry 'bout that

Say they love me cause I went to the south
Said I wasn't gone shine
Had me left for dead
Switch sides
Now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three
And you said it was weak
No limit top dogg the return of da biz
And from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
Last Meal was the one who took me off the leash
Thats the last time a nigga gonna eat off of me

Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's
Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck
So I chunked up the set like what's happenin' with you
Shit I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too
Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out
Or as we say on the East-side, you cripped on out
See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up
Don't forget the block boys givin' it up
Where you from loc?

Show me where you're from
Show me where you're from

Snoop D-O-doub', it's what I does

Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team
They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen
Like a, boss would do, how the fuck could you
Deny my gangsta, haters in my rear-view
All around the world they respectin' a G
Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me

She say she just moved down from The Bay
To L.A. well that's great
We should sit down and talk face to face
You bring the barbecue, I got the paper plates
I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake
And when you dance the way you make your booty shake
Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight
Or a nine, OK, fine, you a dime
And them other bitches they gon' wait in line
They hatin' on you how you take away they shine
Rewind, pay attention to the signs

To be the first one to say goodbye
So, hopefully this record will help you
Get to the conclusion, ya dig?

I love this girl but I don't know about her
As a matter of fact, I could go without her
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother
To try to make it work when she make it so harder
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow
For you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

You don't love me, you just love my doggystyle
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks
So it's, best we go our separate ways and stay apart
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart

Do the windows roll down? do the doors lift high?
Do the car change colors when that bitch drive by?

I'm doing bad
You don't wanna see me this way

To instant manaj's just vintage, relentless

And that's what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink

Beach city rider, 85'er, east sider
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er

You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught
I'm a show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk
It's a cold game
It's like a rap riddle
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle
Most neighborhoods started off cool
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool
With no separation
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation
You know my game is amazing
I keep blazing
East side niggas is the craziest and the shadiest
Yeah dog, tell 'em again
What you talking 'bout loc?
I got hell of a ends

Hell boss
Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)
I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere

More rumors, more lies
More money, more time
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man
Your message is how blessed you is
I guess you is
Look at the mess you in

Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
Girl, you know you are special, girl
The hottest in my mind

I know you, and you know me
And this is the place that you really wan' be
Lets make it crack-a-lack I make it look easy
Life can be a carnival and I'm a be your reason
Kiss me slowly,
Perform quiet storm til I get you nicely
I'm puttin' out the blunt cause I see
I see that I need you more in my life
Than I need a bag of weed.
Now I compare you to a bird
When she fly by
I wanna rock you back to sleep
Like beddy-bye-bye.
Bounce in the 'lac
With your hand on my leg
Throw your bags in the back
I'm a show you where it's at
No telling if we might come back
You like that?
I figured out a way to catch a flight right back
See I ain't never flown for fees
Come spend a weekend overseas in Greece with me
Please believe

[Chorus]

You know, if you're through with me
Then I'm through with you
But you're the one who fell in love
And said that love was true
But you ain't never fake on me
And you think that you gon find
Another G like me?
Dem nigga's ain't gon' play
They gon' just hump
They ain't gon do it yo way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true
And know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, Go to France
On a 3 day cruse
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,
It's our little rondez-vous
Whoopty-whoop
Big snoopy and ooh
I picture this love affair of ours
To last a lifetime just like flowers
Take a quic flick the get dressed
We'll head to Brazil,
I'll show you how it feel
When you're rollin' with the real
How it feel?

[Chorus]

We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't go
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especially
I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible
My ice cream, have a lick
I catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need
Come be my number one, please?
See I ain't never blow no cheese
And done no songs like these
I love the air that you breathe
You know why? (Why-Why?)

And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin' with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes cause you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin' B.G.
I'm shakin' up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of sig sags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin'-ninety-three
I'm fuckin' up every nigga known in the indistry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin' name, who am I?
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Smell) last name (D-O-double-G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound

Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin' for them niggas in the front and the rear

I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permisison', motherfucker I'm a kick it
Niggas sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks

Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin' in the six-deuce

See we smoke and go (?) cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
And pussy stay sellin', so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin' off on the stereo
Killin' 'em on the radio, some of them want to hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy (?) over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin', we keep gettin' more

Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
And had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayne

How dat sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
and reason why niggaz with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap, like Mike Tyson with his license back
Nine to five, minimum wage, what type of life is that for me?
It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around

You had the audacity to want to tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' ""treated like a prostitute""

It's like four and to the five and to the six and to the seven

Well, how ya been? Where ya been and what it look like?
My game trump tight especially when it bump like

Four DPG's gettin' crazy
And No Limit is the label that pays me
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me

Told me game recognize game
And stay true to what ya do and don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm a bad muthafucka

I fall to my knees, thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gang bang
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway, bitch, anyway
You can say what you wanna say

Just don't get in my way 'cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know, see know and P know, see loc'
We make music for the thugs and the bangers
And the bitches, fuck them R&B singers

She want a nigga with his khackies hangin' real low
In a black rag Sixty-four
Hit it down the street, way clean
Bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green

I'm headed straight to the LB
Forget it, that's what they tell me
Sell me everythang except some bullshit
And when it's time for the gunfight nigga pull quick

Him.

What is this pen? so let's rush it.

When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot. 
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up 
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up. 
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed. 
I'm checkin for the gats they strap, so what's up black? 
Chill, lets hit a deal, if it ain't up to what you feel then grab your

Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with? 
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip. 
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me? 
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey, 
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush, 
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""

Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,
Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,
Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,
The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,
Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,
Made it to the top baby, that's on me,
Cops trying to claim that they made me,
I want you to feel another real for gaizing,
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need me,
I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,
Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,
The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,
And I rep the double O, smoking, eating Cheerios

With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,

Life's a bitch but I don't caught again
That's what a word to the third letter

Shot, shot, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever
'Cause I didn't came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks

I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
Its feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
'Cause it's over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don't mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it's dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
Fuck one that one sucked my dick and find another (bitches)

Never understood when it was work day

You are my good looking grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in

And not just a tip, I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm too short, but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around, I fucked a lot of whose in this town
I get down, I come long and white
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's coming up we started at four
I switch so much game, it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates, like pimping, she appreciates
'Cause my women, understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me
If you were broke bitch then you're not a real freak

[Chorus]

You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And now one of my homies wanna fuck
And now she wanna fuck from the get go I figure this is how I gonna be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ride with me
Don't stop, fall hot, Hollywood hills back to too short's spot
You wanna roll let's get go, said yeah
I wanna see if I can make you wet
'Cause you need it let me beat it
Your little fat friend acting conceited
Sitting in the corner, leave it the bitch is  a loner, dancing giving me a boner

I pull a pole on now, me and you girl we need to roll on now
You sat here in the dead weight, I knew you just wanna put your head in 

[Chorus]

She wanna be my BFF, I'm on the time baby got no time left
See I'm a mathematician, you can add the babe
Extract your clothes, then divide your legs
Win it all, equals how you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See you a hot mess with the booty and thang thang
Swinging in the club when you drinking that drink drink
Smoke in the air chilling all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too short ah, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See I just wanna hit it and stick it in
'Cause I don't wanna be your boyfriend
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
Touch it once, I wanna say it again

Snoop Dogg,"I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Kelly palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
'Cause the smoke's already in the air
I am looked up with two braids in my hair
All start with the kaki suit
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the D-I-P
Back then my only wed was my E-Y-E
Use my P-Y-T and you're looking so fine
I am sorry baby girl but tonight

Out of this world, Cooper Black's on the comic
This is church music listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
D-O, double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore
When's the last time you seen the G in the G4
Don't worry I'll wait
Time's ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping, I'll wait
Into the zone where these hoes hold my dog bones
I dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go and get your own
I put peace to rhymes get piece of mind
O-Z to die 'cause this weed is mine

[Chorus]

I hear niggas talking about what they rollin' up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the back open up
Good chance you can see me there, I'm smoking one
License to get a fundamental road of shit
Real nigger blowing weed for hours, rolled it up
If I am in a building it's hard not to notice it
Hitta Billy said, ""Dogg I got some hoes to fuck""
I am gonna fuck you with an ounce of that potent shit
Don't trip bitch we gonna all sip, blow the hoes dip
Let you have mine plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigger get high and let the hoes twist
Say you don't fuck with twist look how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like 'cause I'm rollin' enough paper 
They've be burning for hours
And if it's fire I am smocking the whole thing inside

I got a roll for you
Do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me

I got a roll for you

niggas used to hang out, and do the pop lot
And if we got into some shit, we never pop shots
We walk, scrap whatever he was
And live to talk about it then we get old 'cause
We keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bug
We do a house party, what the fuck is a club

And S.A. they sold most of the drugs
Laugh a million, hell yeah we thug, we getting money, yeah
And we do no ride, represented and talk
Nope, nope, not I, that's the code

Fastest way to catch a hot slug and you don't

Swinging the track, dripping curl juice in your back

You know a nigga don't wanna go to school today
Let me call this bitch, and get my shit together

When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

Uh, this one's for the G's, all black chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees,
I be with the boss dog, y'all fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga, cheese
Remember days homie, I ain't have a thing
Now I'm hoping off a plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money comes fast yours slow like ?
Rolling up grass, so weed to have to style, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke

When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say Dogg put the middle of the jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue, booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines

I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a wholezip away
But fuck that, this the Taylor gang, what you on dog

You niggas still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holler at me when you graduate

I am rolling ? police and don’t ask where I have been got ?
Haters talk when I leave they just ? when they see what they want and they need me

Snoop Dogg,"Yea wassup baby girl
I'm just looking over this homework
I really need some help
You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yea

[Chorus]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Chorus]

Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

[Chorus]

Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

[Chorus]

Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that

Have a little party at my crib 
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is 
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke 
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go 

Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas 
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas 
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga 
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga 
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga 
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya 
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember 
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner 
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender 
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for 
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor 
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for 
So give your parents my apology for me again or 
Get high like we Cheech and Chong 
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs 
Roll up so we can all

[Chorus: x2]

Killer Cali is what we blow 
OG nigga from way down low 
Known for banging the blue C rag 
Started off smoking nothing but Zags 
Popping P's, chopping trees 
501's, all of these 
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me 
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television 
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga 
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be 
East Side Long Beach where I'm from 
Bring your girls, all y'all come 
Give me some, now give her some 
It's big Mac, I love to have fun 
You are, you are the one 
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1 
Break it down, lay it down 
Baby work that body like 
At the pad, acting bad 
Baby what that party like? 
Moving so schizophrenic 
Baby pull down your panties 
Let the Doggy Dog ram it 
I cram to undertsand it 
Back room that's my bedroom 
Make her right up in it 
Close the door, slow ?
I'm 'bout to slide up in it 
Smoke something 

[Chorus: x2]

Having money and blowing hella' chronic 
Smoke I'm stunting 
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running 
Sounding like a dinosaur if the stomach rumbling 
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming 
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner 
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb 
Stuffing kush ?, playing Megaman 3 
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami 
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family 
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing 
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston 
So why get caught up 
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up 
In sewing circles with them hoes 
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole 
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

Snoop Dogg,"Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain’t in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he’s the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me

My ballin' is actually

To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke

Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let’s fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Smokin' tree and  not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business

Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen
Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong

Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog

And blow circles 'round you suckers like a marathon
My gym teacher told, but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework, and now I'm in detention
It sure beats suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention? Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancin' on stage at the talent show
We flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope?
Principal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke

Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers

Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)
Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin through the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Man with no music but happy he's free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

(Snoop Doggy Dogg)

We're comin with that G shit, that see shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I come with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack

(Kurupt)

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill 'cause my ho might call
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only G

(Snoop)

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight

(Lil' Style)

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
'cause I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody a blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust)
'cause I let it sit that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound
'cause he wouldn't even squad back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah)

(Snoop)

Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been *?toetone?*
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

(Dat Nigga Daz)

It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And let me dial slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me

(Snoop)

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

(Young Swoop)

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
'cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G by the fuckin L-be's-see
None of these nigga wanna fuck with these (aah)

Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how s*** be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a n****s just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a n****, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
B**** n****s don't deserve to kick it
With rich n****s, n**** we seven figure n****s
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, n****s of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? 'Cause if you ain't clown

Ayyo snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with n****s
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat n****
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the og's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend jill got killed
And then I dropped to my knees and called on the lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down

Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records
For my come up from sun up to sun down
I'm trying to get my money
Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a b**** was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
'Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take s*** from me, so slow down

I got n****s, shot n****s, drop n****s for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and n****s don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
'Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, b****
We don't, never ever, talk no s***
Unless we back that s*** up, n**** you get lit

Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Nineteen ninety six, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)
Eigthy million sold, and I ain't check the records
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend
Fifty bitches naked
Nike ain't my preference
Khaki with the chucks
Now look how they dressing
Perfecting my profession
Someone call the reverend (nate dogg nigga)
Bury me alive, living legend

Always be a legend

Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You knew niggas look madder than me
Came up with the doc, been around the world with 'pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame

Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
Twenty million, twenty years ago
Cuh, you was like seven
You ain't gotta like it

Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls

Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches

There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin' 
Always a nigga hatin', 
There's always somebody that is displeased with what you do 
You can never make motherfuckers happy 
There's always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled 
There's always some bitch on the side line talkin' shit with her big mouth
There's always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda did with your money 
And what you coulda or would or shoulda
it's just, you understand me?

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not have heard or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
'Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't, wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horse's mouth
Right then and there, we can straighten it out
Cause I don't get involved with he said, she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

People used to say you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they're talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
And not something that you ran and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pebbles overheard her talking to her mam
Pebbles told Cookie what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from crew town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda open your mouth at all
And I wouldn't have no reason to make this call

You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast

I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

Let us begin, what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, up front getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blastmaster (One!), blast faster
No more slave mentality, 'cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever 'cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
'Cause all my teachers and doctors were purists to the fullest
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
'Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back 
And we'll be right back

I'm getting my money the way I do,

Keep to myself, you keep your yourself 
Leave me alone (Poetry in Motion)

Radio, TV, and even the press
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out
Now when you established and got a lot of money
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
(Here comes the vapors)
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She had a big Herringbone with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he sport boots that match with his suits
Push a Lexus Coupe, that's extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors (we checkin' papers)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (she got the flavour)
They caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's calm and plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be like ""Can I borrow a dollar, whoop, you a star now!
They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors (D-A-Z checkin' papers)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors

Now, I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said ""Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors (Warren G is makin' paper)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (yeah, they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Pound
I saw a crew on two-one street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MC's straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
""Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to sit down back in the day""
It happens all the time, so nigga don't be amazed
You caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (Doggy Dogg boy, I'm makin' paper)
They caught the vapors (yeah, haha, he caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (my niggas on top, we makin' paper)
They caught the vapors (take me out, ok?)

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors 
They caught the vapors, yes
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors 
They caught the vapors, yes
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors, vapors, vapors",Vapors [DJ Battlecat Remix]

Turn from crying man poverty

We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight

This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole

Take care of mother earth cause ah she be the planet

Fresh trees, young seeds all tryin' to find the light
Stretchin' out their limbs to the sun, got them right
Help them keep their life will trap
Watch out for life like satellite
Them winds will stop and go like a traffic light
Many obstacles to overcome in the city life
Making sure they stay pure, teach them whats wrong from right

Early light papa you damn my supper
Asking my pop off hot like the summer
You can't never understand why we live the life
You would never recognize unless you see the fire in my eyes

I'm burrying the man like every single day
Black birds in the sky can't get a break
The smoke is my gun that's how I blow them away
Music is my weapon rewind it let it play
Babylon the police sun set all day
They call me Snoop Lion I smoke everyday

Look granded they see
Watch them grow a new breed
Cultivating these streets
Recycle, carries on

And on and on and on it don't stop
The tic tac of the universal clock
To the bang bang boogie the love streaming through me
And the smoke that wait while we procreate

So we came callin' on his girl Diane
A blonde girl dressed in red
I guess pigeon dropping was the name of the game
And I had to pay my dues
Well fun time
Family fun was the plan
Shape the con before it shapes you

Who sent ya' baby girl?

But he cut him from ear to ear
Then he grabbed old Lou said
""We fuck now""
On his face a twisted jeer
He took old Lou to the same cafe'
Eddie couldn't have been much higher
When he tied him up
It was his intent
To put his head in that deep fryer
Well, Diane told me
I tackled Ed
As we did a little wiggle and dance
When we were done Ed got a hot head
Well viva la fuckin' France man!

Selfishness weighs a ton
Lookin' out for number one
As if my life was so pretty
Now things look shitty
And there's no one to save me from
Fuckin' pain
It burns hot from the inside out
Now there ain't no doubt
How this bout started out

Now they've finally brought me down
Sympathy can't be found
Locking doors the only sound
I've screwed over all who care
It's only fair
They've stripped my soul bare
I can't take it
Now it starts to come on strong
The long arm of the law
Coming down on my head
It's been so long
Since I have felt the sun beating down from above
Without bars on my cage reminding me
That I got screwed up
And I've got no love
>From a truck
What the fuck
I'll keep truckin' down
I'm locked in this cell
Kickin' it in hell
Ain't no joke the straight dope started out

(Locking doors the only sound)

Jails, institutions
and DEATH
(think you can take your pick?)

Kickin' dope in a jail cell
You want to die it feels like hell
Muscles ache you cannot sleep
Stomache ache you cannot eat
Do your time and make parole
Now you're free
Out of this hole
Think you'd learn and start to cope
But from the gate you score some dope

Nothing changes
You start to regress
You're all strung out
Life is a mess
Once again",Tecato
Snot,"Break it, Bring it, Down there, ain't no room for us!

There ain't no room for us in your alternative nation.
Seems you've had control for way to long,yes,
Your greed and your dishonesty only add to my frustration,
Can't you see the powers that be,they don't give a fuck about you and me, 
Somebody better say this 'cause there ain't noboby tryin' to save us, Just enslave us, Leave us hangin by the rope that they just gave us, 

Victim of your mistrust
Liar

You, your dance, your stupid cash advance,
No, I'm not a victim of circumstance, 
Not gonna leave my life to chance.

You rape the hearts of us, the artist, 
You reap the benefits, 
Your pockets they get fat as our souls bleed.
Oh, your gettin away with murder,""Son you failed to read the fine print."" 
Labeled whores like festering sores,

Don't you know they've got a deal for you, 
No, it's not enough just to hate this.
'Cause we know the ones in charge are so 
Shameless and wasted energy on the hate defeats our purpose,

Victim of your mistrust,

Now what you got ta do you need ta Stop and read betwwen the lines, 
behind that smile the greed still shows in their eyes, 
That's part of their disguise, Don't believe the lies, 
Don't believe the lies, Don't believe...

The more I learn about your game the less I wish to be involved with you another day,

Get out of my life
Ah yea, Just where do we fit in It looks like we'll never win and with the next big trend, ah the cycle starts again...

That's how we bring it down, ain't no room for us,

Don't let them turn you 'round
And fall out of trust
You've got to take control,
Don't let em have it
They've got to work for us,
Don't let them forget
They've got to earn the trust",Unplugged
Snow,"I've been here before
It only made me cry
I felt so sure
I never questioned why
Till I woke up alone
That's why I have to ask you
Baby what's behind your kiss
I need to know your heart's in this

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the kind of love
That is strong enough
To walk through anything
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
I only want to play for keeps
want to fall in deep
If you don't just say goodbye
Don't waste my time

The words you say
Are what I want to hear
Promises you make
Are music to my ears
Is it the heat of the moment talking
Promises come easily
Give me something to believe

Time, time, time, time

Don't waste my time",Don't Waste My Time
Snow,"Sweet dreams of you every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Snow,"Here's a real sad song 
A song that must be sung 
Think about the days when we were young 
When we were kids girl all you wanted to do was play 
But that was then and look at how you're living today 
It's making me sad and almost brings me tears 
But you may just open your eyes when the smoke clears 
Girl what happened to the smile that used to clean 
Once upon a time in your life you used to dream 
At the top of the swim team but now you're drownin' 
How quick your change was the most astounding 
What you're gonna do is you against the world 
You started off being such a sweet girl 
Times go by, and years they start to drift 
Now you're staring down a deep cliff 
You can pour but don't overflow the cup 
Girl you better 

CHORUS 
Ease up 
So down 
Girl you better change your life around (ease up) 
So down (ease up) 
So down 
Girl you better change your life around (ease up) 
So down 

No longer kids now we're considered as teens 
Now we start learning what the letters in life mean 
You had a good home living the good life - who knows 
You might have made somebody a good wife 
How is it wrong when things which are so fun 
Now you walk around with a body with no mind 
You entered the gateway to all life choices 
Your brain was kinda hollow so you followed the voices 
And you let it mislead ya 
It took your body and soul and it said that it freed ya 
Each and every girl like you is a sad case 
You always have a beautiful look on a sad face 
It could never be the way that it was 
But if you're on the dope then that's what the dope does 
If you pour don't overflow the cup 
Girl you better 

[CHORUS ]
And now it comes to the final solution 
Robbing and stealing and prostitution 
Can't you see that your world is a shamble? 
Life is a big game with plenty of gambles 
So much time many things that are undone 
No longer you cause there's you and a young son 
You got one there are girls with two or three 
Can't get a fix on 'em it's driving 'em up a tree 
Just stop and think of your young child 
Before he winds up as a name in a closed file 
As I reminisce and take a look back 
I wish I knew what to do to put you on the right track 
But yet the train that left the station 
And your money's on a permanent vacation 
The more you pour you overflow the cup 
Girl you better

You were everything that I thought would be a lady 
Personality and a class that match 
Won't you look inside your heart and give Snowman a chance 
'Cause your my... 

[Chorus:]
 
One even day her and I at the disco 
Watch how the girl she just a dance down low 
Now watch the girl pon east and the girl pon left 
You dance too much you a dance to death 
And now you no do it right if you no work up a sweat 
Personally Snowman I don't know why I do it 
But me still have to watch to see another 
How she moves up her hip and go straight to shoulder 

[Chorus:]

So I walk up talk up hope I don't mock up 
Something in her eyes said Snow you must knock up 
Me I'm feelin' lonely and free 
If love is so blind then why can I see 
A me say seven years ago when you first start be my baby 
You were everything that I thought would be a lady 
Personality and a class that match 
Won't you look inside your heart and give Snowman a chance 

(I girl me love the girl that need my girl my best friend) 
(Yes she did a gone and she no phone me again)

Snow,"Come down? 
All right? 
Hit it! 
Baby I have no reason why as to spread rumors that would hurt you 
In the back of your mind you know that I wouldn't lie 
I wouldn't tell you things, mislead you 
He's running you down, spreading your name around town (around town) 
About your love you must be crazy (crazy) 
In spite of it all I can't believe you would fall 
For a bullshit love, oh baby (oh baby) 
When a man loves a woman when a woman loves a man 
They shouldn't speak their business upon the street talk around 
(they shouldn't talk about their business) 
Pick a person and keep it private 
Never want and talk about it (oh) 
The choice is a must and now you just 
Can't give me stuff to think about 

I don't want to wait in bed for your love (and you won't) 
And a when me say (never) 
And when me talk of love, yeah girl me talking (forever) 
Now what about with other girls like a man now when we are (together) 
Now if you think I'm a joke and I lie then bomber (whatever) 

(don't let him do what you want) 
We got so much things to say right now 
We got (so much) things to say 
(they gotta do what you want) 
We got so much things to say right now 
We got (so much) things to say 
(We got so much things to say right now) 
We got so much things to say 
We got (so much) things to say right now 
We got so much things to say 

I keep tellin' ya 
(He) says she loves me 
(he he) I know it's gonna be above me now 
He told me his heart was (mine) 
He told me he loved me (loved me) 

Blah blah blah he's blabbering all of the time 
Search deep in your heart and true love you must find 
Pick a person and keep it private never want and talk about it 
The choice is a must and now you just can't give me stuff to think about 

I don't want to wait in bed for your love 
(I can't wait no more, no, no, no) 
I don't want to wait in bed for your love 
(I can't wait, you're taking too long) 
(What you gonna do) 
I don't want to wait in bed for your love 
(It's up to you) 
(Don't make me wait for you, don't have me wait) 
I don't want to wait in bed for your love (and you won't) 

And a when me say (never) 
And when me talk of love, yeah girl me talkin' (forever) 
Now what about with other girls like a man now when we are (together) 
Now if you think I'm a joke and I lie then bomber (whatever)
