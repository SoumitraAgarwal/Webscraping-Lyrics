American Hi-Fi,"I understand your point of view
So what do I say
I've been so underwhelmed before
You've got a lot to prove
Somewhere lines get crossed it's true
It's the nature of things
The longer we can see it through
The more we make believe
Baby likes a blue sky
I don't mind if it's gonna rain on me sometime
Maybe got her mind made up for sure
Baby won't you come back home?

All the people that we love
Disappoint us the most
Makeshift friends and low demands
We're running outta time

My late night call
One way to fall
I miss you still",Baby Come Home
American Hi-Fi,"Waking up late, a grey Sunday mourning
Got up on the wrong side, so go back to bed
Newspaper says, it's gonna be raining
At least until Wednesday, but I pay no mind
The wonder of it all
Caught up in the everlasting fall
Watch the years roll by
Counting shooting stars across the sky
You can wait a whole lifetime to figure it out
The best days are the ones we forgot about

I can't complain, it's been such a mild winter
Flip on the TV, those shows that we love
The sun will go down, on a north Tulsa sky line
Over and over, like the day before

We know everything must have an end, we can't pretend
It's so nice of you to stick around",The Everlasting Fall
American Hi-Fi,"I don't understand
How we drift so far away.
I keep on holding on
But your hands are feeling so numb.

Nobody told me that there would be days like these
I'm falling baby, can't you see?
And you're in no hurry to keep me from coming undone.
Take a look at what we've become.
Where do we go from here?
I don't want to disappear.
Our hearts are on parade
So you can watch them fade.

I don't understand how the worst of times
Get stuck in your mind.
I'd like to take away
All the stupid things that we say.

Nobody told me that there would be days like these
I'm falling baby, can't you see?
And you're in no hurry to keep me from coming undone.
Take a look at what we've become.
Where do we go from here?
I don't want to disappear.
Our hearts are on parade
So you can watch them fade.

American Hi-Fi,"She likes the boys in the band
I'm moving fast as I can
Sliding over in her direction
Pause to check out my reflection 
She's wearing all the right clothes
The jam is playing on the stereo
Checking emails on her phone
She got more hits than the rolling stones 

Hell yeah so young and fine
Could she be the one my baby
I'm gonna make her mine
At least for tonight
Hey ya'll I gotta know
Did she get my number maybe
You tell her blow me up
I'm one call away, hell yeah 

She's everything that you need
The kinda girl we all dream of
Long legs never stop
Like all those videos in zz topp
She got the stars in her eyes
And she don't mind if you tease her
Can't get her outta my mind
Can't you see she put the freak on me 

You know it hurts when she looks so bad
Can't you see you're the best thing I never had
I'm walking out the door before I act like a fool
(She's not that cool)

",Hell Yeah!
American Hi-Fi,"Nobody really knows the pain
But everybody knows your name
You've got their full attention, all eyes on you
Small talk can get you through the day
There's got to be a better way
When all your friends are faceless
You can fake it
He knows the highs and lows
He'll give you what you need
And we all agree it's time to shine
He'll stand and deliver
He goes about his day
Smile and a wink hello
When the picture's gone
Fading to black he's poppin' down prozac
Nobody knows the highs and the lows

Sports cars and fancy souvenirs
That you collected all these years
So proud and self assured, hold your head high
A chest of broken memories
Of how and why and what could be
Still locked inside your closet
You can't fake it",Highs and Lows
American Hi-Fi,"Some call it love I don't know what you're thinkin' of
Such a mystery to me
Somehow you always like to play undercover
It's your path to discover

Roll me like we're tumbling dice
A wrecking ball rag doll ain't no breathing space
All the tapes have been erased
Prize fighter taking all the punches he can stand

And dropping on command
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you

What don't you understand
Forget the master plan
I'd give it all away to have you back again
I said it in my letter

So we could make it better
No need for you to read between the lines
Baby can I be your baby
Definitely maybe won't do

Ruby red play dead they don't make a sound
Plastic soldiers in a row
You're shouting calling all destroyers what to do
They're coming after you
Surrender but the battle is won

She thought of cars where to drive trying to survive
How to make the great escape
Still watching live on other planets fall apart
She wears it on her heart
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you

Someday you'll see
All our worlds collide
Way out in space",Maybe Won't Do
American Hi-Fi,"No one told me there'd be days like these
I'm sick of sinkin' man I'm on my knees
Tell me again just why you lied to me
It's separation anxiety
Where did I go wrong?
Is what I'm feeling
Some kinda love song
To stop the bleedin'
Get on the right track
We'll never make it back
You go the wrong way
You're goin' my way
All the things I said to you are over now
And I just can't get over you

Since you've been gone I fall apart
I knew you'd leave me from the very start
Tell me again just what you want from me
It's separation anxiety",Separation Anxiety
American Hi-Fi,"Staring down the boulevard
Crescent heights the city lights the way
To another wasted day
Shiny cars and shooting stars
California dreaming in my ear
I just wish that you were here
I'm dealing with scars
Just trying to see who we are
Nobody said it would be easy
Fighting your way through another day
I think I know how you feel
Looking for something that matters
Keeping it together when it's all been shattered
We all want something real

Summer's on a holiday
Pills to chase the blues away
Who knows just how far this story goes
So listen to the radio
Turn it up so you can sing along
Even though the notes are wrong
I'm building up walls
And trying to break all the falls

All your life you're wondering
We don't know what's happening
Somethings gotta give
Falling through the atmosphere
See the world in black and white
These pictures coming clear
How many times I wished that you were here",Something Real
American Hi-Fi,"We were good, playin' hard, rollin' down the boulevard
Liquor drinks, between the bars
Making out, back of cars
Hey, you see that girl?
She's the one that wrecked my world
Think you're gonna take it far
She don't want to know who you are
Sunset strip, back in black, i'm right on track
Holdin' court like obie wan, baby's got it goin' on
So what am I supposed to do
She left me I got nothin' to lose
Exit axis bold as love got a new girl i'm thinkin' of
One thing you gotta know
I thought I did everything just to keep you around
I hope that you're happy now
I'll keep my good intentions and you keep the car
This story's coming to an end
Baby we can't be friends

Disco trip, party ships, breakin' down those ruby lips
Ex-girlfriend, comes in view
Sees me there with someone new
Hey, you see that girl?
She's the one I wrecked her world
Baby's in my Cadillac, drivin' off no lookin' back

What makes you think I'd want to call?
I forgot your number
What makes you think I care at all?",We Can't Be Friends
American Hi-Fi,"Monday morning and the coffee's on
What happened to my perfect world
Front page news she's already gone
Say hello to the goodbye girl
LA traffic don't make it better
I wonder if she read my letter
Nine to five keep it all alive
Some days are hard to survive
I feel so down about it

I don't want to be alone
Just waiting by the phone
I can't stand another night on my own
With a new day rising, realizing
That you gotta be free break it down to you and me
Is it everything you want it to be
I wanted you all along
So where did we go wrong?

Never had a lot of money
But we spent a good time in the city
Drinking wine and watching the tele
Old movies she sure looked pretty
This kitchen feels so alone
Haven't cleaned since she's been gone
Spend my nights at your favorite bar
And wonder where you are
I feel so down about it

I don't want to turn back time
I just want to change your mind
I just want a chance to prove to you
I really want to chase these clouds away
Save them for a rainy day
There's nothing left to say",Where Did We Go Wrong
American Hi-Fi,"Another Friday night, to get the feeling right
At the bar when he sees her coming over
What you gonna do, if she walks up to you
Tongue tied better get yourself together
Pound another drink, to give him time to think
What's your sign hey I think you know a friend of mine
All the stupid lines, that he had ever heard
Wouldn't come to mind he couldn't say a word

Tonight tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

Got her holding steady, forget her name already
Sweatin' hard not a smooth operator
She's got it going on, dancing to her favorite song
He's got the line is it your place or mine
She turns and walks away, where did he go wrong?
But waiting by the car, she says what took you so long

Tonight tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

The very next day, he guessed she ran away
The one and only in his bed so lonely
But she comes walking in, with coffee and a grin
Crazy as it seems, it wasn't just a dream
And all around the world, people shout it out
The geeks get the girls

Last night he finally got it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
Shout it all around the world cause the geeks get the girls",The Geeks Get the Girls
American Hi-Fi,"I remember how you radiate

Comes crashing at my feet.

I try to watch the sky for signs of a new life
I try to stay with what I know.

Sounds of bliss

American Jazz Quintet,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is [Live]

And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden

Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away

Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden

Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten all the people killed
Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon

And those left to carry on

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

American Made,"Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs.
I'm not a real political man.
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran.
But I know Jesus and I talk to God,
And I remember this from when I was young:
Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love.

Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' on some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs.

Is it the look of things to come
Has it all been said, has it all been done

Watched it crumble on the ground
Making no protesting sound
As if justice was finally found

Frightened by the sweet things we told each other
Frightened by the things we made them see

I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Playing red light, green light, such timeless fun

""I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone""

Pregnant with the timeless drop and the wind

The plague of always deserving something better
God save me from the rewards I deserve
One for giving up hope and the one for the love that I serve

Down the bone-dry rivers that drain L.A.

Sets up more windmills that all waste my time missing
When it should just be your lips that I'm kissing

That it's too important
For anyone to destroy

On the rug by the bed

And the gun goes off
And paints her face all red
When she was dancing with him
He was dancing with the dead

You can forget your dreams

Your uniform is clean

Loves what they mean
They show the world

When your true lover comes your way

The story goes that once a cherry tree
Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

And that is why the poets always write

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Start to carefully contemplate 
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turn to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange stuttering 
On every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind

And I should hide from such a love affair
My friends think that I'm so insane to fight this feeling, 
But my life's at stake
Your embrace, thoughts won't erase
Every now a minute of the day I wait

Everything was exactly how it shoulda been
Going through the ups and downs

Of each-others touch what we waitin' for
See whenever I lie down to sleep

I want to set it off, but

So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Hear voices I don?t want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.

Our love what we once treasured
Your ways what I remember most of all
Can't quite get away from the days we love so heavenly
Your kiss such a sweet surrender
That day when I let my temper get the best of what we used to have
Now I got to ask you can you make it

Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Now I won't usually press nobody
But why can't worse as hastily
Before God had forgiven me
Thought the love that we had count for anything else
Only one way to find out how and you know how

Ohhh, don't want to lose your love
And I can't stand to lose your touch

Why can't you say that you've been at her place
You hurry wash your clothes, the scent of her perfume

Boy don't you know you are my *Crush* 

(I want this sometimes) I wonder could you ever feel the same. 
(I get lost in your arms) Nothing else to see, because there's no-one here but me & you.

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day
But that never mattered too much to me
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything

Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want
But that never mattered too much to me

Show me some body with no goal
Show me some body with no control
'Cause life is for living
So go and get it
When times get rough remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Ohh gotta get it
Hey hey hey
Sometimes the road may seem too far
You never really know for sure

If you're ever gonna make it
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you got the strength to make it

But you gotta remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower

But it's to good to be true
Sometimes I feel I'm losin' my mind
Cause everything I'm feelin' all depends on you
You make me feel better
Than you turn to bring me down
Got me running to keep ya
Know I should leave ya
That makes you the illest thing around

Oh, you got me right
Oh, it feels so right

Switchin' up it's like you read my mind

At the end of the day
No matter what I say
You know that I'm runnin' back to you

I don't worry 'cause we're so tight
See each other 'most every night
She let me have the master key
That's why I kiss her explicitly

They think she wants to play
But she's so doggone pleasing

Amerie,"Dear john
Right now you are probably wondering 
Where I am who I'm with and why you are reading this
But before I go into.. 
What I'm up to let me confess
Dear sweetheart 
I know about you're secret 
Where you've been, who you with, I saw you out with her
And yet you always try to maintain
How I got a good thing and I can't do better
Do you remember what you told me? 
Cause I remember it well (how could I forget)
Do you remember how you said no one could want me
And I said time will tell

that's why I'm so sorry 
That I couldn't be there 
To see the look up on your face
And I'm so sorry that it took me so long 
So long to put you an your place

I'm writin you this letter 
Just to let you know that 
That I still love you 
But I won't be comin back
You had me at hello 
Now I gotta say goodbye 
Cause one too many times you made me cry

dear john
I'm hopin that this find you well..
Dear john
But you put me through a living hell
Dear john
You left me with nothin to do
Dear john
Dear john
I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

dear john
By now you're probably see my clothes are gone
Keys are gone and I ain't lovin
So don't even bother 
To call my number 
Cause I got it changed
Why john
Couldn't just see 
I gave my heart, gave my time 
And I got nothin
So it shouldn't be surprising 
This letter I'm writin 
That you there by yourself
Do you remember what you told me? 
Cause I remember it well (how could I forget)
Do you remember how you said no one would want me 
And I said time will tell

that's why I'm so sorry 
That I couldn't be there 
To see the look up on your face
And I'm so sorry that it took me so long 
So long to put you an your place

I'm hopin that this find you well
Dear john
But you put me through a living hell
Dear john
You left me with nothin to do
Dear john
Dear john
I'm leaving you

but I can end this with those saying 
Thank you for everything you put me through
I've come so far alone
I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm leaving 
I'm movin on
And now I'm so much wiser
Cause the pain that you gave me
Never ever put me down
You're only made me strong
I'm leavin I'm leavin I'm leavin
John, I'm gone

I'm writin you this letter 
Just to let you know that 
That I still love you 
But I won't be comin back

Cause everything your saying right now, you can saying forever

You should have been the answers to the questions in my mind
But your here ain't going no where you'll never let me go

Hey, Hey

When I was younger girl nobody told me about the facts of life.
I was living in the clouds I didn't think about whats wrong or right.
So I didn't understand that playing games is what some people do.
I swore I didn't start my life until the day I fell in love with you.
And you kept taking me higher just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man? 
Cause you've got my heart in your hands.
And you took me high as you can, 
Higher just to drop me off.
Tell me did it make you feel good? 
(Ha) Treating me the way you would. (Ha)
Cause you took me high as you could. 
Higher just to drop me off.

When I was a younger girl nobody told me I would have to fight.
To keep my sanity I couldn't love because I'd lose my sight.
So mostly everything you did is send another gift you broke my heart.
Until you came around again, and I was right back at the very start.
And you kept taking me higher just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man? Cause you've got my heart in your hands.
And you took me high as you can, higher just to drop me off.
Tell me did it make you feel good? (Ha) Treating me the way you would. (Ha)
Cause you took me high as you could. Higher just to drop me off.

Does it make you feel good to know broke me that's what people say.
Does it make you feel good you broke me down. (Uh)

I give you all I have, till there's nothing left, 
And all the time I spent, I can't get that back so
I think of what to do, 
What I wish I knew, 
How to keep away from you. (Hey hey hey)

So do you feel like a man? 
Cause you've got my heart in your hand.
And you took me high as you can, higher just to drop me off.

Everything is alright when we argue half the time almost every night

It's a hard road I'm facing
So maybe I should keep it moving
Cause I can only trust you baby
As far as I can see what's in front of me

You keep telling me that I keep asking you these questions 
That don't make no sense but we both know they do.
Now we arguing and now you're leaving once again 
And I just sit here wondering what will I do

[Chorus]
How can we make it love
When I don't trust
How can we make it love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love
Cause Everything is everything when were just making love
How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love

Answer me this, now do you really wanna go there
Cause if we go just know we won't make it back
Just cause yo girlfriend said it don't make it fact
If anything her corny ass just make it wack.
We all say shit then take it back
I think I listen to too much drake in fact
Cause I'm the best you ever you had
Your friends just mad cause I'm the best they never had
If you don't trust nothing you can trust that
I come with new shit and have em like what's that
That's low so, encase you didn't know so
And trust me I don't even trust me

[Chorus]

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love
Cause Everything is everything when were just making love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love

And I don't care that you're thinking
Every time you turn around I'm trippin'
I got my intuition and I got receipts
I ain't seeing things

It's hard to live with the question
Who you with and what you're doing
I'm keeping one eye open
So don't even try to Jedi my mind

You keep telling me that I keep asking you these questions 
That don't make no sense but we both know they do.

Now we arguing and now you're leaving once again 
And I just sit here wondering what will I do

[Chorus]

It's a hard road baby, it's a hard road baby
It's a hard road baby, loving you loving you yea
I don't trust you baby, I don't trust you baby
But I love you baby,
More than me, more than love, more than you",More Than Love

Amfibian,"her lies were waves i floated on
her silence was a blanket
her stare was bitter poison
and with no choice left i drank it
i struggled in her gentle grasp
but couldn't break her hold
each tiny breath betrayed her bidding
i'd obey untold

she scribbled sometimes in her book
and never let me see
i'd sneak up behind her
and she'd close it silently
i waited through the april rains
and thought i heard her say
through the thunder - i'll be here
if you stick around till may

i turned around to see atlantis sinking in the mud
and now the puddles fill with water thicker than my blood
i won't live to see tomorrow i've gotten here too soon
i see the writing is eroding before reading the last rune

her eyes were slivers of the sun
in brightness she grew bolder
she pressed me for my secret 
and with no choice left i told her
she struggled in my gentle grasp 
but not to break my hold
in rapt anticipation of
what fate had left untold

see how the damage is done

on a summer's day I get an awful chill
after just one sip I know I've drunk my fill
you think that I'm the prey but you're the one who's caught

sometimes I can see for miles in the blackest night
sometimes though you never see I watch you for a while
sometimes though it just can't be I think I see you smile

In questo ocean cuore che plu pace non ha
E mi trascinerai dove terra non see'e
E come la marea fuggirai via da me
Lontano da me fuggirai

Tu, solitudine profonda
Che nei silenzio griderai
Tu acqua e fuoco che m'inonda
Tu che non togli sete mai

Tu, sempre tu

E mi trascinerai dove terra non see'e

Amici Forever,"There's a land
That gave me life
That made me free
That made me proud

And someday
I will return
Home to the land
Of the long white cloud

Where is home?
I hear you say
So far away
So far away

I hear your voice from afar
It haunts me wherever I stay
But I must follow a star
So far away
So far away

In the song
Upon the breeze
And in the roar
Of rolling waves

Like the roots
Of ancient trees
That run so deep
In the earth I crave

Where is home?
I hear you say
So far away
So far away

I hear your voice in my heart
I miss you much more than I can say
But I must follow a star
So far away
So far away

Where is home?
I hear you say
So far away
So far away",So Far Away

Amie Comeaux,"Blue, I was beginning to think I'd always be
Blue, skies never seemed to follow me
True, love I never thought I'd find

Amie Comeaux,"She was sixteen and he was twenty
She'd never strayed from that small town
He rode the rodeo
Her daddy said you know

She'd laugh when he would say
I'm gonna marry you someday

It's a struggle just for us to stay the same

Tonight I feel you come back home
Like a drifter finding shelter in these arms
Tonight I feel you've come back home

Of what she used to be, used to be

Closed the sky
And you're a shadow, a shadow
Another woman I feel like I used to know

Don't you patronize
Don't you look at me
With your drunken eyes
My indifference is a lot like yours
Though I can't escape

And your new life, baby
Throw caution to the wind
Everyone knows you're not coming back again

Because you're so beyond
That seems as though I never knew you
Here and now I see right through you
What have we become?

Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind you?
With your shadow it served you well

But I will still hold on to pictures
Of the way that we used to be
And the way that I knew you once before
(Knew you once before)

You had me from the start
Our love was like communion
At peace with who we are
And what we could be
Singing in your car
Singing lines from movies

Staring in the dark
We were both so free
Things remind me of you lately
Looking back it drives me crazy
What have we become?

Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind?
With your shadow it's served you well

Just enough of today's misery

But I'll be fine
I'm a little bored and lonely but that's life
It just seems to go one hundred zero
It never does pan out for me though
I'm hopeful that it will in good time

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow
And look out at the open road

We talk all night though I'm not sure
He can hear me with closed eyes
But he tells me what I need to hear
Then he drifts away and disappears
And I'm older than my skin is in this life

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow
And look out at the open road

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow
And look out at the open road

I sleep all day when I wake, I run

So I slip into the tempting stillness

And I look out at the open road

And with my arms wrapped around you

I know we used to keep that feeling out of sight 
It's getting stronger, I feel it burning in my mind 
Slowly teasing me it's growing deep inside

Show me how sweet and easy it can be
And let us stick together and make it happen

Take you to the top 
Tell me every hidden thought

Do the best I can

Amil,"Amil outlaw fly indeed
Got every chic's man eyeing me
Think you could crush this try and see
It's the major coin i-n-c.
And am too hot to just be warm
I start fire alarms from dusk to dawn 
Catch me with the diamond clusters on
And Gucci feathered sandals with the mustard thong
Model mommy
The body like a cola bottle mommy
Mulatto up in the galoino mommy
One in Amilliyon killin' em
Might have to change my name to billioyn
Voice so ill you'll want to speak my shit
Joints so hot you'll want to leak my shit 
Plus haters sneak peak my shit 
But still I be the only one to freak this shit

[Chorus]
Ya'll dead wrong
If you think you can be fuckin' with this 
And you'll know
That ya'll got nothing on this
Ya'll want that or you want something like this
Those who hate
Yeah ya'll just fronting on this

Why chicks don't want to rap on the same song as me
You need a verse ma it's on me 
See all this publishing belong to me 
Just imagine how the secong album gonna be 
Non-stop party hopping 
Roc roc rocs and keep on rocking
Everything I spit be popping
Anything Amilliyon want she copping
Whoop whoop ain't nothing change
And I play more ballers then them rucker games
Light gray studs, ring, watch, plus the chain
Will I ever be broke what's my name?
Have you ever seen a chick like this?
Ever heard one spit like this
I dead'em all put my word on that
All money is legal and I murder tracks

[Chorus]

Cute as a button
Can't tell this bitch nothin
Ghetto fab whole chick bubbling
Diana Ross the boss of the rock 
Shit you know me I got to floss at the spot
With a dime as nigga who be tossing knots
Every bitch hating 'cause I'm scalding hot
It can't be because I got begets on
Cause niggas love this bitch even with sweats on
I'm the A-m-i-l-liyon
Strictly be on that shit major coins be on
I got joints making competition want to drop dead
I got joints making you bop your head 
I got joints that will have your eyes blood shot red
Fuck the doe I want my props instead 
Stay real with it
Might pack steel with it 
You can hate but you still gotta deal with it

For the dynasty, a million

Check it out, yo

Aiyo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood 'til the death, now aim for the sky
My four blow fo show, fo doe, for only
It's money, drugs and hot slugs you know bleek

Squeeze hammers t'il they nail me, fuck what niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firin' is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas

Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Rap money in rubber-bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert eagles, street sweepers, loud metal

It's hit an run now, motherfuck anyone of you
We dem niggas be in ya crib just like furniture
Pop up with the gun in ya
Release one for zero-zero M Bleek R O C dot com

This philly cat back at it
Still throwin' crack at it
Still fuckin' with them crack-atics
Still bust 'em with them black matics

It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You tryin' to get my ass at it
They say I think ass backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics

Our tracks nice, hug the block ta tract dice
Late night, club night, mac attract dikes
I pull up, Cadillac truck nice
Two guns, you know mac pack gat twice

Gets that crack back wit that ice
No joke wit the coke, I wips that right
No doubt, never droubt, gets that price
It gets that nice, when you live that live

Papi knows yours name
And you ditched that wife
Nigga it's gets stacked green nigga
It gets stacked chain nigga

I get forty G's a feature now
Hold Franklin's like a Aretha now
In the SL two seater now
And I'm in nuthin' but diamonds

I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra
I fuck wit dem cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars

I'm talkin' rent money, I'm talkin' bank money
I'm talkin' Martha Keats step of with the rent money
Movin' on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corna, plus

Give me an inch so I can take a mile
I bring life like a new born naked child
Bitches tryin' ta come up, gotta wait a while
As of now, Amil-lion just played ya style, you dealin' with, nigga

The, the roc, the the, the roc
(Let me talk to y'all niggas real quick)
The, the roc, uh uh, the roc

Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this dynasty thing
Y'all thinkin' Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin' more like ""ming
I got four nephews, and they all right in
They all young and wild, plus they all like things

And I'm havin' a child, which is more frighting
But y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big benzsesses
Come through flossin'em shiny rims it is

An office don't pop up in their sentences
I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know I focus young Memphis is
Or I see was so real, when you add on Amil

This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothin', movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Roc-A-Wear, eighty mill like, eighteen months
You could bullshit wit rap if you want, muthafuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon' see what's what
Holla at Hov, I'll be in the cut what

It's the, the roc, the the, the roc
It's the, the roc, the the roc
You rollin' with the roc

Amil,"I'm on the up and up to hot to touch nigga
The narcs couldn't stop the rush
Smuggled in the package tight
I'm 98 a gram leaving attics nice
I get 5 you don't get half a mic

Been known to cut ass for the added hype
And I pop too much shit to be the marriage type
Get spoiled even when I'm not acting right
Can't nobody come with the style I bring?
Piece hanging on the chain just a dangling

Motorola 2-way so the cell don't ring
Crush R and B and I don't even sing
No reference and no pro tools
Till I'm up in my Hersh I'm a show and prove
Got up in the game and made my own rules
Put heat on the reels until I blow the fuse

All money is legal baby
And what, and what all money is legal baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know about this
All money is legal baby, the higher the price
The hotter the rhyme

Amilliyon doper than heroin
Shoes got to be Gucci with the fresh pair on
Spend up doe till it's damn near gone
Lay it down get spins all year long

You know I run through them papers quick
You know I rock them glaciers sick
Chilling waiting for these shares to clear
I'm the only hot bitch you gonna hear this year

You know I ass kick with no practice
Any joint I'm on automatic classic
Niggas pay me just to do ad-libs
And I move the crowd like I move to Saks Fifth

If I'm a gonna flash rocks then I'm a stash glocks
If I'm a gonna talk shit  then I'm a walk it
All money is legal now
I'm with Hov, Bleek and Sigel now

All money is legal baby
And what, and what all money is legal baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know about this
All money is legal baby, the higher the price
The hotter the rhyme

Give me my cue and I'm ready to roll
Take a little ghetto celebrity stroll
Floss with the minks to heavy to hold
Baggettes be whoa, I gets me doe

I'm an uptown swinger
With the light blue on the pinkie finger
Amilliyon 'bout to shake some ass
I'm crack packed in till it break the glass

Keep crates of papes, in the steel encased safe
Watch doe accumulate like real estate
And you know I gotta keep tricks up the sleeve
Leave 'em bankrupt with blue balls till the dick bleed

Save all receipts write it off quickly
If I'm a ball I'm play up in the big leagues
Never fold when the pressure come
You could put Amil up against the best of 'em

All money is legal baby
And what, and what all money is legal baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know about this
All money is legal baby, the higher the price
The hotter the rhyme

All money is legal baby
And what, and what all money is legal baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know about this
All money is legal baby, the higher the price
The hotter the rhyme

",All Money Is Legal
Amil,"[Verse 1]
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and I'm just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

[Chorus 2x]
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

[Verse 2]
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

[Verse 3]
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",Anyday

Now when you first stepped to me
Didn't think you wanted to do me
Started taking me to dinner and the movies
Had me open off the minks and jewelry
Buying me things that you know I wanted
Begging me for loving and you know I fronted
Now we doing more then getting blunted
And we both know we shouldn't of done it
Because wifey  at home and that's a no, no

That you been doing more than flirting
Where you at when you say you working

She could feed the kids and wash the clothes
She could cook dinner and mop the floors
Just keep giving me a lot of doe
And give me some loving before you gotta go
Once you get home your girl be beefin'
Wondering where you was this weekend
Her cousin told her that she seen us creepin'
I guess by now she know you cheatin'
She must of found my number cause she calling me
Couldn't talk cause her man was all in me
Told her call me back at a quarter to three
Now that's the way real players ought to be
Shall I tell her bout the S he ordered me
So hy you fuckin' with him?
Cause he can afford me

It was the money that made me get with you
But right now I'm trying to get rid of you
Cause you always at my house like I live with you
want to lock me down like I got kids with you
See I knew from the gate that you was taken
If I told you that I loved you, I was only faken
Shit it ain't like that I want to keep you
But I'll beep you when I need you
Now who getting played better you than me
Cause I know you could never be true to me
If you did it to her you could do it to me
Start slippin' and you might be losing me

They said you be sweating every freak in sight

Yeah I know, one day you gon marry me
Yeah I know, you want to have your seed
Yeah I know, don't worry, 'cause there is no other
Yeah I know, and you can't stand your baby mother, right

Oh, you never felt this way before, huh
Want to keep me in the gucci stores, huh
What happened to them minks and the diamond rings
Lying ass nigga, you ain't buyin me things

Nigga don't tell me I'm your flyest bitch
If I can't get the keys just to drive the whip
If I ain't the one you take on the private trips
If you got it like you say you do then provide them chips nigga

[Chorus]
[jay-z]
We'll always be togetha
No one can fuck you betta

Yeah nigga I heard this all before
Yeah nigga I heard this all before
Yeah nigga you drive me crazy
I want to have your baby

Yeah bitch, I heard this all before
Yeah bitch, I heard this all before

I thought you ain't like rap
You was deceiving me
All you do all day is watch bet
Actin' like you ain't recognize when you met me in the ride

Mispronouncing my name, squinting your eyes
You shouldn't play games wit pimp like I
Now that I gained you, I'm supposed to sympathise

Yeah I know, you hait parties and you never go out
Yeah I know, you a nun and you stay in your house
Yeah I know, well can you please do me this favor
How you been with three rappers and six ball players, tell me that

Shit, we both gamin each other
Lying through our teeth, both blaming each other
I tried to front on you I take you to my rest
You tried to front on me actin' like you ain't impressed

I'm tryin' to see if the coochie's propa
You trying to score your self a gucci parka
And that new shit from prada
You tryin' to get a rich baby father

I'm tryin to forget you by tomorra
This ain't rocket science
Ain't no rock buyin, just a hard rock lyin
And stop frontin like your shit is real

You get your game from oprah and lauryen hill
And if you are a nice girl, and I read you wrong
Look, I'm sorry if I lead you on, ok

Nah nigga, you ain't got to apologize
I knew that bitch want your cousin on your father's side
I mean damn, you don't even let me answer your cell
I mean damn, why I still got to ring the bell?

I find girl phone numbers and you say they your mans
When I call you don't even know who I am
So you can go ahead wit all that game you throw me
Don't tell me, motherfucka show me

You can be outta here baby

'Cause cash, coupes, credit cards
All the exotic things baby
I got it
I got it, I got it

Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box
Magazine want cameras to pop
They catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox
Listen dude but I got dollars and cents
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent
I got that
(I got that)
Catch me a drop black playing Speedy Gonzalez
Toes never unpolished
The way I be dressing dudes wanna toss the salad
The way I be dressing got broads acting childish

Y'all got that?

Do for Amil what Amil can do

Amil-lion, uh
I got this what?",I Got That
Amil,"Yo, ever since I known you, you been out to get me
Acting like my peeps, but I know that's how you tricked me
Love to see me get high, love to see my tipsy
Heard you even wanna stick a little chip in me
You been trying to play me close ever since my shine
Wanna take me to dinner, feed me shrimp and swine
You said, ""Amil I want you to meet a good friend of mine
His name is Money and we partners till the end of time""
Introduced me to your clique, hate, envy, lust and greed
Said you want the whole world in ya custody
And if I give you my soul you'll give me luxuries
Said you could hit me up wit power, it's just up to me
I turn you on when I'm in short skirts and tight jeans
You want my kids to write Santa and celebrate Halloween
Told me sell my people crack and get rich off fens
You love the number six but hate the number thirteen

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

You wanna, be the one to pick me up when I fall
Told me hang Casear bojease on my living room wall
It was always something bout you that made my skin crawl
You turned me into a player and showed me how to ball
You give me rewards when I rob and steal
Want me to abort my babies and get on the pill
You put burners in the hood so each other we kill
I see your eye watching me on the dollar bills
When I got the scoop on you, it just made you mad
Cause I moved out your crib, packed all my bags
Them days I turned to you was the days you laughed
You used to smile every time I pledge allegiance to the flag
We speak now and then but we ain't smacking hands
You be up in the clubs asking me for a dance
Still trying to convince me to go cheat on my man
Begging me to please give you just one more chance

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

When we was kids you was the one who taught me how to lie
Said I could always use you as my alibi
And you kept me from knowledge, wisdom, and the most high
Had me believe God had blonde hair and blue eyes
Our relationship went sour since I found the truth
You know you can't have me so you fuck with my youth
You got all my phones tapped, I gotta talk at booths
I learned an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You built Sodom and Gomorra for us all to live in
When we was cool you used to tell me all your visions
Like how you gonna rule the nations under one religion
You got this New World order, it's like a big prison
You said you wanna be worshipped from noon to noon
Nothings gonna get better is what we all assumed
Cause nights is getting shorter and it's snowing in June
I see you working overtime cause you out of here soon

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me
",Quarrels
Amil,"My life
Is in the arms of the man upstairs
Through trials and tribulations
He'll always be there
You see I know he loves me
And I know he cares
And he'll bever put more on me
Than I can bear

[Verse 1]
Is it a blessing to live or a blessing to die?
Let me finish out this hell with no questions why
I should be happy I'm on and dressing fly
But is the game changing me for the extra pie
If you could look into the life I live
Three sixty catching up to all the trife I did
Got my people up north trying to slice the bid
While I'm in love with a nigga with a wife and kid
Maybe if my pops ain't abandon me
I wouldn't let so many niggas take advantage of me
Using me some even put their hands on me
I wonder what the most high got planned for me
My life line getting shorter when I look in my palms
Swore I'll be nothing like my biological mom
She ain't raise me so naturally I never felt a bond
At 16 got my GED never saw a prom

[Chorus]
I been weak and I been strong
I been through the fire, I been through the storm
Try to do right and I know I do wrong
Just be happy for me when my life is gone
Cause no more hurt and no more tears
There'll be no more pain and no more fears
No more people in my face that's not sincere
So smile 4 me when I'm no longer here

[Verse 2]
At a young age I let the world turn me out
Pellets and purple haze been burnt me out
A hard knock life is all I learned about
Trying to eat the only thing I be concerned about
Telling my youth everything happens for a reason
Let him know ain't that his father wanted to leave him
If it wasn't for the streets he'd still be breathing
Trying to raise him myself but I know he need him
Me and my seed used to live off mostly welfare
Only two checks a month for us both to share
I remember making sure that the coast was clear
So I could boost us some muthafucking clothes to wear
Had to hustle 'cause them food stamps just wasn't enough
Upstate back to Broadway gott to go re-up
All this fast cash only turned the heat up
Can't afford to get knocked but who gonna feed us

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Can't shake these thoughts of suicide
Anyone I ever loved or was close to died
Ones I trusted or thought was being true lied
A lifetime of tears but only a few I cried
Try to take my past stick it up on a shelf
But my actions stem from all the pain I felt
I'm just trying to make the best out the hand I dealt
If I fall who can I turn to for help
Hope my man with me or with my health
Will he be there through good and bad sickness and health?
Does he want the real me or somebody else?
I been in wars just so I don't jurt myself
Now that I'm on most can't stand me now
They was happy when I rocked all them hand me downs
When I need them funny how they can't be found 
That's why the most high's my only family now

Chorus",Smile 4 Me

If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man

Je me sens si bien je ne veux plus hésiter
C’est un si beau jour pour te le dire
Et t’ouvrir mon cœur sans m’ retenir

Ces temps ci j’y pense matin et soir
Tu me manques déjà quand on s’ dit au r’voir
Grâce à ta présence mon cœur n’est plus noir
Je t’aime tellement fort tu dois me croire

C’est maintenant ou jamais j’ le sens j’ le sais
Quelle sera ta réponse un oui m’ suffirait
Mais si c’est un non je comprendrais
C’est pas si facile mais j’attendrais

Loin de toi je n’ suis rien du tout
Je n’aime que toi et un point c’est tout
Juste un oui laisse moi juste une chance
Juste un oui et notre vie commence

Il est bientôt 20h je viens te chercher
Pour un tête à tête ou je t’ai rencontré
Toujours en retard tu t’ fais belle pour moi
Et comme d’habitude j’ t'attend en bas

Arrivés on s’installe je commande pour toi
J’te connais par coeur j’ prend la même chose pour moi
Tu me sens nerveux tu m’ demandes ce qu’il y a
J’te réponds c’est rien ne t’en fais pas

Est-ce bien le moment tout compte fait
C’est tellement difficile ta réponse m’effraye
Je dois te le dire c’est maintenant ou jamais

Soit franche, dit le moi
Si tu pense que le temps est venu d'une pau-ause
Soit franche dit le moi

REFRAIN 2:

Ne soit pas fausse, ne me ment pas
Ce que j'envisageais, tu n'en voulu pas
Ne soit pas fausse, je n'le suis pas
Les yeux dans les yeux, non ne dévie pas
Mais à qui la faute si on n'en est là?
La dignité d'un homme ne se monnaie pas
Mais à qui la faute si on est là?
Si tu veut partir, je te retient pas, te retient pas

Seul à seul, à quoi tu penses?
Mes inquiétudes et ton silence
Entre nous, un vide immense
Baby, Baby, tu ne nous laisse aucune chance

Seul à seul, je l'ai voulu
Seul à seul, tu m'a déçu
Seul à seul, je ne veut plus
Je sens, qu'au fond,
De ton coeur tout est perdu

Amine,"Je sens que mon absence
Te rend différente
J’ai le sentiment
Que c’est un mauvais présage
Je rentre le soir
Plus un regard
De tes grands soupirs
J’ai bien compris le message

Toutes ces années
J'ai tout donné
J'ai bossé dur pour ton bonheur sans hésiter
J'ai tout misé
Sans me soucier
De notre amour pourtant si pur mais en danger

Refrain
T’as longtemps hésité
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
Tout fait pour m'éviter
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
T'as même pas essayé
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
J'n'ai jamais voulu ça
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi

Je t'ai toujours aimée
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
Regarde où on en est
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
Ce qui est fait est fait
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
J'n'ai jamais voulu ça mais
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix

Ce soir j'vais tout préparer
Lui montrer qu'je l'aime
Qu'entre nous rien n'a changé
Les heures qui défilent
Et pas un coup d'fil
J'appelle même ses copines
Mais personne sait où elle est

J'pars la chercher
Dans le quartier
En espérant qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé
Et là j'la vois
Juste devant moi
Avec un autre, plus d'doute je n'y crois pas

Tout ce temps à t'aimer
Sans jamais douter
Je te vire de ma vie
Et tout s'arrête ici
Stoppe tes larmes et tes remords
Entre toi et moi c'est mort

C'est pas c'que tu crois
Alors c'est quoi
Ne me laisse pas
Vas-y lâche-moi
Tu te sépares de moi
J't'ai dit lâche-moi

Aminé,"Walking on the pavement I chip my pride and my teeth on
The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down
The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howls when the train
Comes like me ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl
Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr
That's why I couldn't blame her
Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better
These are the only days I missed
Like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams now I dream

I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the inner me

Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law
The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO
Bullets from the past act like I'm they fucking hero
Living in LA for the weather, I FaceTime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my home
Well I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told em' I don't smoke, they say ""boy, you fucking wildin'""
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb
Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

Not satisfied don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the inner me

Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I said ""red wine, Sauvignon, Rastafar', Babylon""
Our youth will never die if I live it like a prize (hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Every time I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

I slip and slide through the tides of my youth
What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's the age? I guess we find out when we're older. Touché

Amir,"Not before the day you said goodbye 
Did I even know that I could cry 
And how I have cried

All those reckless games inside my mind 
Leaving this tortured soul to find 
Somewhere to hide 
When I told you that 
I loved you 
I believed you felt 
That way too 

Maybe I fell head over heels 
Maybe I just got it all wrong 
Oh, feeling hopeless not what I dreamed of 
Maybe if you knew how it feels 
Maybe you'd be singing this song 
Where does my broken heart belong? 

Days are long and nights are filled with fear 
I'm falling apart 'cause you're not here 
And losing control

All that's left of who I used to be 
You've taken it all away from me 
I gave you my soul 

Maybe I fell head over heels 
Maybe I just got it all wrong 
Oh, feeling hopeless not what I dreamed of 
Maybe if you knew how it feels 
Maybe you'd be singing this song 
Where does my broken heart belong? 

When I told you that 
I loved you 
I believed you felt 
That way too 
And I must find a new

Amir,"Chaque jour le chant du réveil 
Chaque jour sa sirène m’appelle 
Chaque jour je transperce la ville 
Au rayon du soleil 

Comme une fourmi dans la foule 
J’ai le tournis mais je roule 
Chaque jour je traverse ma vie 
Comme un homme qui se saoul 

Le cœur en dilettante 
On me dit qu’il est temps de gagner 
Des trophées, des amantes 
Il est l’heure d’avancer sans penser 

On me dit qu’il est temps de chercher 
Ou de me trouver, d’arrêter de rêver, de rentrer dans le rang, d’oublier 

Oh oh oh, oh oh 
Il est temps qu’on m’aime 
Oh oh oh, oh oh 
Il est temps qu’on m’aime 

Chaque soir j’essuie vos regards 
Chaque soir je rentre plus tard 
Et je transperce mes insomnies 
A la lueur des phares 

Chaque soir je sens dans ma chair 
La lame du temps qui opère 
Chaque soir je traverse mes nuits 
En marin solitaire 

L’aventure qui me tente 
On me dit qu’il est temps de lâcher 
Mes folies, mes attentes 
Et mes envies latentes sont gâchées 
Moi je sais qu’il est temps, de chercher, de me trouver 
D'arrêter de rester dans le rang et de vivre caché 

Oh oh oh, oh oh 
Il est temps qu’on m’aime 
Oh oh oh, oh oh 
Il est temps qu’on m’aime 

La vie défile 
En histoire ou en idées il est tant qu’on s’aime 
Rien est facile 
Mais on a le cœur tranquille et tant qu’on s’aime 
Et même si les gens disent que c’est inutile et tant qu’on s’aime 
Tant qu’on s’aime 

Oh oh oh, oh oh 
Il est temps qu’on m’aime

Amir,"L’euphorie des jours est passée par nous déjà
On a fait le tour, on a franchi le delta
Y’a t’il un antidote au poison des détails?
Nos cœurs qui s’érodent
C’est le temps qui les entailles, entailles, entailles

Plus rien ne m’agite
Une étincelle, ou je m’éteins sans toi
Plus rien ne m’agite
Si ta peau hésite
Prends moi la flamme et je brûle avec toi
Si ta peau hésite

And I know
Your fire took away my pride
And it's burning down inside

And I know
That only you can turn the tide
Lift me up and make me glide

Viens le temps des anges
Qui nous ramène en arrière

On goûte aux mensonges
La vérité est amère, amère, amère

Juste à la limite
Entre la queue et les envies d’encore
Juste à la limite

Si ta peau me quitte
Que reste t’il pour faire chanter mon corps
Si ta peau me quitte

And I know
Your fire took away my pride
And it's burning down inside

Je suis prêt à m’en aller 
Pour aller chercher ce destin qui me ressemble 

Je n’ai jamais eu peur de tenter, de voyager 
Cents fois j’ai traversé des routes, des ponts qui tremblent 

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Tous mes chemins mènent à toi 
Il y a mille étoiles mais au dessus un seul ciel

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Mais mon seul pays c’est toi
Même loin de tes yeux je serai toujours fidèle

Je reviendrai comme on plonge
Enfin dans le bain de la vie
Je te vois même dans mes songes 
Comme le jour cherche la nuit
Je trouverai enfin tes bras

Je suis allé si loin pour trouver la liberté
Là ou ne vivent que le chagrin et le silence
Sans peur du lendemain j’ai reçu comme j’ai donné
J’ai perdu souvent j’ai retenté ma chance

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Je ne vois qu’un seul visage

Il y a mille étoiles et pourtant je ne vois qu’elle

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Elle est mon seul paysage
Une voix qui s’élève et vient chanter l’essentiel

Je reviendrai comme on plonge 
Enfin dans le bain de la vie 
Je te vois même dans mes songes 
Comme le jour cherche la nuit 
Je trouverai enfin tes bras 

Je prendrais tous les tournants, tous les tourments 
Pour te revenir 
Et sans attendre mon tour, je prendrai tous les détours 
Puisqu’il y a l’amour à bâtir 

Je reviendrai comme on plonge 
Enfin dans le bain de la vie 
Je te vois même dans mes songes 
Comme le jour cherche la nuit

Amity Dry,"Once again, I wonder what I'm waiting for?
Once again, I'm staring at the phone
I'm trying to find the words to tell you how I miss you
How it's changed since you've been gone

And you might not understand if you've never loved a man
So deep and so strong that you'll keep on holding on

To that road the leads me back to you every time
To the voice that's telling me to leave it all behind
My heart's still beating to the rhythm of your love
And nothing else can be enough, no no

I can't remember now what could have been so bad
Whatever made me let you go
And I know that time has made me blind to the reasons
It's a sugar coated memory, that I know

And you might not understand if you've never loved a man
So deep and so strong that you'll keep on holding on

Once again I wonder, why I love you still?
Why I just can't let go of the past?
'Cause in my heart, I know that it was over long ago
But being without you is just too hard

So don't try to understand 'cause I don't think I even can
Why it's so deep and so true, the way I'm loving you

Once again I wonder, why I love you still?
Why I just can't let go of the past?
'Cause in my heart, I know that it was over long ago
But being without you is just too hard
",Every Road
Amity Dry,"Yeah, I know it's crazy but I don't even care
Words of warning about, be careful now, I just can't seem to hear
With you it seems I've broken every rule
But I believe in chances and I'm going to take a chance on you

'Cause when I rest within your arms
It feels like I'm finally found

And it's plain to see, yeah, that baby, I believe this is love
(Love has finally found me)
And I can't hold back now, I've finally found you, my love
I have finally found my love, my love

And it feels like I should be right here with you to stay
'Cause I want to know this kind of peace within me always
Never known just how it felt to not be scared
So I'll put myself in your hands 'cause I know you'll always be there

'Cause when I rest within your arms
It feels like I'm finally found

And it's plain to see, yeah, that baby, I believe this is love
(Love has finally found me)
And I can't hold back now, I've finally found you, my love
I have finally found my love, sweet love
",This Love
Amity Dry,"I've always been kind of brave
Never one to watch what I say
And people think my heads in the clouds
But I believe in dreaming out loud

'Cause all my life I have wanted more
The chance to prove what I know I'm here for

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through
'Cause it's all I've ever wanted to do

I've always seen it so clearly
Always known where I'm meant to be
I know my life has a purpose
And there are great things waiting for me

'Cause all my life I have wanted more
The chance to prove what I know I'm here for

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through
'Cause it's all I've ever wanted to do

And I know it won't be easy
But nothing is for free
And if I just keep believing
I will find my dream

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through

The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Amore' Rayne,"I met this pretty girl
She was from D.C.
I liked the way that she smiled

Said, “There’s a party tonight,
You oughta come with me.”
She said, “Baby, I’ll try.”

I waited all night long
For her to walk in
For her to bring me her light

Then she came in the room
She looked right at me
She was the vision of my life

Can’t wipe the smile off my face
Ain’t nothin’ bringing me down

I feel like stompin’ my feet
I feel like groovin’ all night

With your body close to me
I hope you can feel my energy
Watch you move your body
Get hot with me

Where is the moon lost to us
The moon will not gleam at all
Nor will the sun shine at all

Death opens its mouth

Camo to look, to listen

""There beyond the river is hero walking""

He took one step and took another
To the north's shore he hurried
He drew his sword, wrenched the iron
Snatched from the sheath the harsh one

Upon whose hilt the sun flashed
Upon whose back a horse stands
He uttered a word, spoke thus,
""There the sun has gone from you

Softer the side of a grove

Out of a great pike's shoulders
From a water-dog's hooked bones
It was made from the grief
Molded from sorrow

Its belly out of hard days
Its soundboard from endless woes
Its strings gathered from torments
And its pegs from other ills

Amos Lee,"Saturday night, my head is spinning.
I wonder who's heart I've been sinning for.

Cold rain blows on my window.
Soft sand gone from my pillow.

One more step that I've been taking,
Yes and one more,
I don't need no more breaking up.

All the red lights, how they are
Burning down the highway.

I remember when the wind
Had blown my way.

But the wind blew down my line.
Yeah, the wind, blew down my line.

Man on the street, each day I'm passing.
A small bite to eat is all he's been asking for.

Oh, but cold steps is all he's been yeilding.
Oh, and now I know that empty feeling.

Yeah, the wind blew down my line
Yeah, the wind blew down my line.
Yeah, the wind blew down my line

Amos Lee,"The darkness has always been,
The world was born into a blanket of sin,
When all the faith's been gone,
Still we found a reason to carry on,

[Chorus]
Through the worry, worry, worry,
Caught in an endless maze
Oh when the lights go out,
All I can think about,
Is how, we've seen better days

Oh lover lately I've been thinkin' I might leave you,
As you're surrounded by these fools who do deceive you,
Yes our past is wretched true,
But I'm still in love with you,
Thats why I am still refusin' to give in to

[Chorus]

Where do we go from here,
While we're all so consumed by fear,
Why I'm trying not to be suspicious of those I'm suspicious of,
I'm tryin' to crack-open this angry heart and find a little love,

Oh when the lights go out,
All I can dream about,
Is how, we've seen better days",Better Days

I played at Yoko, you were John
We dropped out, tuned in, got turned on

When we came out one of them said, 
You young folk don't have no respect

And we had the time of our lives
Together as one

You were taken away
Now you are gone

I have so much to say
But, someone so blind above
Has chosen my way
No matter how I try to bend my fate

Will I meet someone like you?

My mind is falling apart
Thinking about you
Really brakes my heart

Thrill me wait till tomorrow night
Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right

You said that I would never let you be alone
How many times have you been on your own
Worked all the days to find the things you try to do
If only my heart will never let you through
Because you

Thrill me you've got a love so strong
Thrill me you just can't do me wrong
Thrill me wait till tomorrow night
Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right

The truth is you've gone and left me on my own
How can I face the fact you're really gone
Love was a phase we'd have to pray to make it true
If only my heart would've never let you through

Thrill me wait till tomorrow night

Though some have changed, some for ever not for better
Some have gone and some remained
All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I love them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There Is no one compares with you
And these memories loose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

No I know I'll never loose affection
For people and things that once before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Wanna be where you are

Brightest of them all
Wherever you go I will follow
And it doesn?t matter how far
Like a shooting star, you
Shine brightest of them all

Lost, I felt weak until I found you
You hit me with the
Spark of a light in your eyes
Keep me cool and I feel brand
New
Like a breath of fresh air like a natural high
I
Lose sense of time

Good bite out of the city

Free your mind, your behind's gonna follow
Do the crime, do the time when tomorrow comes
We're the pretty ones
Shop around, settle down, get a job, be a slob
What you get, what you give's your prerogative
That's how we live

Throw your pennies in a wishing well
Might get heaven and you might get hell
Black white flashlight, show me what you got

We had to meet we stuck together
The hard times the bad signs
Only made us better

There will be stops we never listened
We flip the odds we went the distance
To stay true cus we knew
All that we've been missing

Better safe then sorry

Should mean something
Out of nothing

But I've got to come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
Or they'll never know that they can go
To the mountain of the Lord

Now praising the Father is a good thing to do
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth
But if we worshiped all of the time
There would be no one to lead the blind

But I'd love to live on a mountain top

But I've got to come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
Or they'll never know that they can go

Now I am not saying that worship is wrong
But worship is more than just singin' a song
It's all that you say and everything that you do
It's letting his spirit live through you

Still I'd love to live on a mountain top
Fellowshipping with the Lord
I'd love to stand on a mountain top
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar

But I've got to come down from that mountain top

Amy Grant,"I will wait for the bridegroom
I've awakened early to say
I will wait for my bridegroom

I will give to him my impatience
I will give him all of my fear
I will make my heart very quiet

In bright color, in joyous line
In morning light and lamp fire
I?ll make fine my home here
And trust in my home to come

Amy Grant,"Fairytale, my life was just a fairytale
I was letting an illusion
Come into this heart of mine

Fairytale, searchin' for a fairytale
Hiding in a world
Where life was simple all the time

I was just like Peter Pan in Never Never Land
Afraid of what the future might be
Afraid to face the things I couldn't understand
Afraid of things that I couldn't see

But fantasy, I know
There's more to life than a fantasy
There's so much more
That my life was meant to be
So much more than make-believe

Fairytale, it seems just like fairytale
But there's something in my hear
That says this time the story's real

Fairytale, extraordinary tale
Of a King who offers love
So far beyond what I can feel

There's a world out there
That human eyes can never see
But it's just within the reach of the heart
Two princes wages the battle for eternity
But the Victor has been known from the start

Now I can see the truth
Can seem so much like a fantasy
But make-believe was never as real to me
I know this time the story's true

Just like Sleeping Beauty in a Neverland
I was dying under a spell
But then a Prince who comes from the Foreverland
Awakened me from my fairytale

I stumble down the hall and I open up the door

Back to a heart without his love inside
I was more than just alone, I was dying on my own
Thinking that nothing was ever gonna save my life

Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe
His love has taken my life this far so far
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive
What I'm beginning to be look what, look what

When you stop and think it over do you think you're doing well
Are you getting stronger, can you really tell?
If you're truthful with your feelings then you'll see there's room to grow
Though we may have found the answer

There is so much more to know, more to this life
'Cause we can never stop growin' or we'll start to die
I cannot survive alone, I am nothin' on my own

With rocking chairs and squeaky stairs, all pieces of her world
And a fire in her room to keep us warm

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark

And now we're not as young as when I played there all the time
And the visits seemed too scarce and far between
But life goes on at Mimi's house and in my mind I'm there
With a fire in her room to keep us warm

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark

Growing strong and graceful in her God

She seems to know the secret that we'll never be apart

'Cause love has made his home there in her heart

Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
'Cause we've got to break away
Break away to be

Faith-walkin' people, can't rely on everything we feel
Faith-talkin' people, we must discern what's really real
Faith-walkin' people, you can't believe in everything we see
Faith-talkin' people seems like such a mystery

But in all the earth there is nothing worth
Half as much as life with you
'Cause the people and the things we're counting on here
They're gonna pass away too

I don't understand everything is planned
But I don't really have to know
'Cause he's giving me a joy that's filling my heart
When I learn to let go

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
'Cause we've got to break away
Break away to be

Faith-walkin' people can't rely on everything we feel
Faith-talkin' people, we must discern what's really real
Faith-walkin' people, you can't believe in everything we see
Faith-talkin' people seems like such a mystery

",Never Give You Up [Live]
Amy Grant,"Well, I may not get applause every night when I sing
And I may not hear the cheers of a crowd
And my voice can't always rise to make the mountains ring
And at times I can't even sing out aloud

But You've got me singing a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps You on my mind

Sometimes my voice is strained and the strings won't hold a tune
My back is sore and I'm just too tired to try
And I don't want to work or rest or think of You
Or face the world or even close my eyes

But You've got me singing a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time, I know that
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps You on my mind

My broken dreams, they don't bother me
And hard times in life I don't mind
I think of things that I'd rather see
And You give me piece of mind

Hard times will come and sometimes I won't wanna sing
But I'll sing with all the love that I can find
And I'm happy there to hear me in the silence of my song
I'm gonna sing for You until the end of time

'Cause you've got me singin' a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps you on my mind

And it keeps You on my mind
You've got me singin' a love song
And it keeps You on my mind
You've got me singin' a love song

",Walking Away with You [Live]
Amy Grant,"You gave me time when no one gave me time of day,
You looked deep inside while the rest of the world looked away,
You smiled at me when there were just frowns everywhere,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

[Chorus:]
That's why I call You Saviour ..... that's why I call You Friend,
You touched my heart ..... You touched my soul,
And helped me start all over again,
That's why I love You, Jesus ..... that's why I'll always care,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

You gave me laughter after I cried all my tears,
You heard my dreams while the rest of the world closed it's ears,
I looked in Your eyes, and I found the tenderness there,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

[Chorus:]
That's why I call You Saviour ..... that's why I call You Friend,
You touched my heart ..... You touched my soul,

I hope you feel the same when you see all my fear,

I fall sometimes.
It's hard to walk in sinking sand.
I miss the rock, and find I've nowhere else to stand.
I start to cry.
Lord, please help me.
Raise my hands, so you can lift me up.
Hold me close, hold me tighter.

I have found a place where I can hide;
it's safe inside

Like a child who's held throughout a storm;
I'm safe and warm

I wonder just how many storms it takes

you're here always.
Even when my skies are far from grey.

You never can tell; he might even be you
He knelt at the altar, and that was the end
He's saved, and that's all that matters to him
His spiritual tummy, it can't take too much
One day a week, he gets a spiritual lunch
On Sunday, he puts on his spiritual best
And gives his language a spiritual rest
He's just a faaa...
He's just a fat little baby!

He wants his bottle, and he don't mean maybe
He sampled solid foods once or twice
But he says doctrine leaves him cold as ice
Ba, ba, ba, ba...ba, ba...ba, ba!
He's been baptized, sanctified, redeemed by the blood
But his daily devotions are stuck in the mud
He knows the books of the Bible and John 3:16
He's got the biggest King James you've ever seen!
I've always wondered if he'll grow up someday
He's momma's boy, and he likes it that way
If you happen to see him, tell him I said,

One more day alone again
The work gets longer every day
Why'd I have to get away?

But I have found a comfort here
Solitude can be so dear
Loneliness is not so blue
When it puts my mind on you

I love a lonely day
(I love a lonely day)
It makes me think of you
(I love a lonely day)
All alone, I can easily find your love, I love

I love a lonely day
(I love a lonely day)
It chases me to you
(I love a lonely day)
It clears my heart
Lets my very best part shine through, it's you

Lonely people everywhere
Lucky, lonely ones who care
You've got all you need and more
Someone to be lonely for

Someone cries for you to hear
Take your heart and wipe that tear
Give them someone they can miss
Give them love and sing them this

I love a lonely day

It makes me think of you

Are said and done
And nighttime finds you home
Are you all right
To spend a night
Of being all alone?

And do you hide
Between the lines
Of conversations past?
A wall of words
A heart unheard
That hides behind a mask?

I'm raining on the inside
My heart wells up with tears that start to pour
I'm raining on the inside
But then your cries of love break through
And I fall in love with you once more

When friends who care
Can't be there
To ease away my pain
And peace of mind
It's hard to find
Like sunlight in the rain

God sees my heart
The deepest part
Inside this lonely me
And reachin' in
His love begins
To heal the heart in me

I'm raining on the inside
Oh, my heart wells up with tears that start to pour
I'm raining on the inside
But then your cries of love break through
And I fall in love with you once more

Sometimes we're raining on the inside
And our hearts well up with tears that start to pour
But when we're raining on the inside
Let his cries of love break through
Know that he loves you, once more

Sometimes I'm raining on the inside
But then your cries of love break through
And I fall in love with you once more

Amy Grant,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

Amy Grant,"Day turns to night, and I turn into bed.
Can't get to sleep, something's in my head.
Pacing the floor, I try to force a rhyme.
Why do I fear this time?

[Chorus]
It's not a song till it touches your heart.
It's not a song till it tears you apart.
After what's left of what's right and what's wrong,
Till it gets through to you,
It's not a song.

Now close your eyes, look into your hand.
What do you see?
Life is our song, to give and learn to take.
Time will not wait.

Oh, won't you please come dance,
While the song's still playing,
Won't be long till the silence falls.

Amy Grant,"You know some days I like me, some days I don't
Some days I try with passion, sometimes I won't.
I might just hold my guard up, and lock my heart up tight
But it's the door that's open letting in the light
There's a battle raging inside of me
It's a holy struggle, and it won't let go of me

No, no, no
I don't want to stop the fighting
Wo, wo, wo
I just want to live right

I used to sit and ponder if I'd be fine
If Jesus lived His own life and I lived mine
But love is such a magnet, it pulled me night and day
Until my needy heart just couldn't stay away
Life can drive you crazy or just about
But even when it's most frustrating, this kid's not walking out

No, no, no
I don't want to stop the fighting
Wo, wo, wo
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it
No, no, no
I don't want to waste my life hiding
Wo, wo, wo
I just want to live right

I've made up my mind now, I don't want to lose out
(Unguarded)
Beginning to see now,What the fight is about
(Unguarded heart)
I gotta stay open, keep defenses all down
(Unguarded)
Don't want to be hiding when the love comes round

No, no, no
I don't want to stop the fighting
Wo, wo, wo
I just want to live right

No, no, no
I don't want to stop the fighting

Sure it's tough but I won't deny it
No, no, no

Against the window pane.
I remain your closest friend,
And wish you back again.
You wonder how I feel;
You think you've pushed too far.
If only you could see this pen
Scribbling down my heart.

I'll be waiting.
I may be young or old and gray,
Counting the days,
But I'll be waiting,
And when I finally see you come,
I'll run when I see you--
I'll meet you.

But still the days drag on.
Why did you decide to go?
Did you only need to see
What only time can show?

I'll be waiting.
I may be young or old and gray,
Counting the days,
But I'll be waiting,
And when I finally see you come,
I'll run when I see you.

And even if
You never do return,
Still I will have learned
How to love you better.

I'll be waiting.
I may be young or old and gray,
Counting the days,
But I'll be waiting,
And when I finally see you come,
I'll run to meet you.

That there went out a decree
From Caesar Augustus
That all the world would be taxed

And each went to be taxed to his own city
So Joseph also went
With his lady innocent
With his lady innocent

The lions in the mountains
Let them pass and followed
Close by night to guard them

From Galilee to Bethlehem
She journeyed with only a donkey to ride
With Joseph walking beside
Came to David's city

And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,
And running to his people before the break of day,
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:

Angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me!

God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:

Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,

Amy Grant,"We were young,
And none of us know quite what to say,
But the feeling moved
Among us in silence anyway.
Slowly we had made
Quite a change
Somewhere we had crossed a big line.
Down upon our knees,
We had tasted holy wine,
And no one could sway us
In a life time.

Purer than the sky,
Behind the rain.
Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.
Love had lit a fire;
We were the flame.
Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

Not a word.
And no one had to say we were changed.
Nothing else we lived through
Would ever be same the same,
Knowing the truth
That we had gained.

Purer than the sky,
Behind the rain.
Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.
Love had lit a fire;
We were the flame.
Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

Stay with me.
Make it ever new,
So time will not undo,
As the years go by,
How I need to see
That's still me.

Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.

Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

Purer than the sky,
Behind the rain.
Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.
Love has lit a fire;
I am the flame.
Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end

The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree.

Can never heal a hurting human soul.

And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,

Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth!

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore

Amy Grant,"I have found a perfect mystery
Love has a hold on me
Long before my life had come to be
Love had a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

Where do I come from
Where does life mean
Is it not to know the one who made me

As I'm looking down the road ahead
Love has a hold on me
Someday when I breathe my dying breath
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

Where will I go
When this life is through
Back into the light that made me and you

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

I don't have answers to all the questions
Running inside of my mind
But I can't help believe that
Understanding comes in time

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide, I know inside
Your love has a hold on me
Tell me yes, tell me no, my heart will follow
Your love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide
Your love has a hold on me
Your love has a hold on me
Your love has a hold on me

We only had ourselves
Nobody else

They thought they had us down
But we came around
How we rolled and rambled
We got lost and we got found

All our times would bring
In this world of dangers
'Cause when your heart is strong
You know you're not alone

Every good girl hears it
Every bad boy fears it
No matter what i see
I believe, i believe

The power touches me
The power helps us see
The power holds my hand
The power drives me crazy

And through it all we still survive
A poor man screams but no one hears
Ain't nothing changed much through the years
Every bad day needs it
Every good day breeds it
No matter how it feels
When it's real you know it's real
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made

Just how amazed i am

Amy Grant,"Who knew love would come walking through' my door
Turn a light on somewhere down inside
And give me a feeling I'd never had before
It was a long wait
It was just the wrong time

But I hope you'll hold me now
Somewhere within
And when you think about
What might have been

[Chorus:]
Cry a river
Flood the sea
Cry a river over me
Take the bitter
With the sweet
And cry a river over me

How can you argue with a feeling in your bones
'Bout what is and what isn't meant to be
Some things you live with
But you never let it show
Like the pain I felt
The day I watched you leave

But I hope you'll think of me
When tender winds blow
Sit on the shores of love
And just let it go

Amy Grant,"There was this guy, he was down on his luck
He was truly poverty's child
Well, he had no home and he had no car
And he wore a weary smile
Moved out to l.a., knocked around for awhile
But he was getting nowhere
Then he did this movie and it did really well
Now he's a millionaire
See, life is a curious thing
Life, ooh life is a curious thing

I know a man who could paint the town red
Had a college degree in fun
'till the doorbell rang and a long lost flame said
""this little boy is your son""
Gave him a suitcase and a bear
Left 'em in a cloud of dust
Now he's checking out schools and driving carpools
Learning to adjust
He says life is a curious thing
Life, ooh life is a curious thing

Well, I know that it can be demanding
I know that it can be unkind
I don't really understand it
But lord sure knows I try
Life is a curious thing
Life, ooh life is a curious thing

Let me tell you 'bout a kid I knew
A pudgy girl back in school
She had greasy hair and geeky glasses
Object of ridicule
The other day in the check out line
They were ringing up my rice and beans
There she was, a pretty little face
On the cover of a magazine
And I said life is a curious thing
Life, ooh life is a curious thing
(chorus)

Just goes to show that you never know
Just what tomorrow may bring
But I'll tell you this that what it is
Is seldom what it seems

Amy Grant,"There you go making mountains
Out of such a little hill
Here I go mixing mortar
For another wall to build
There's a struggle in this life we lead
It's partly you
It's partly me (but)
Every road that's traveled
Teaches something new
Every road that's narrow
Pushes us to choose
And I'd be lying if I said
I had not tried to leave a time or two
But every road that leads me
Leads me back to you
Here we stand in the middle
Of what we've come to know

I thought of what you said then I thought some more

And all you want is just a taste of the unknown

Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone
You say you need a change, I recognize the tone
Buy me a ticket please, to anywhere I'll go
I'm not saying what is right or what is wrong
I'm just thinking you've been hanging here too long

So, why don't we, just up and leave it all behind
Maybe a change would ease your mind
For a time, leave it all behind

What I really want to do is see you smile
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while
There's too much going on to keep it all inside
You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout
What you need is just a place to let it out

Knowin' what once was here just makes me want to cry
Used to be the favorite place
Now what remains are memories even time cannot erase
Old man Johnson's store, where we grew up too fast
All that remains today are echoes from the past
Used to be a boomin' town
All that's left is either broken up or broken down
Singing, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh
Where we used to belong
There ain't nobody home
Said, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh
You can knock all you want
But, ain't nobody home
Packed up, moved away, runnin' from the past
Leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass
Used to be a busy town
Now, everybody passes through, but they don't stick around

Was a newsstand on the corner
Right next to the barber shop
And down the street there
That's where all the kids would stop
And they would tease the neighbor's bulldog

All we're really looking for is some place
Safe and warm
The shelter of each other in the storm
Maybe one day
We can turn and face our fears
Maybe one day
We can reach out through the tears
After all it's really not that far
To where hope can be found
Maybe one day
We can turn this world around

Who can trace the path of time
Not you or me
The twisting road we call our lives
We cannot see
The hunger and the longing everyone of us
Knows inside
Could be the bridge between us if we try

[Chorus:]

Maybe one day
We can turn and face our fears
Maybe one day
We can reach out through the tears",Turn This World Around
Amy Grant,"Come and gather around at the table
In the spirit of family and friends
And we'll all join hands and remember this moment

May it carry us through
Should we ever get lonely

Shining with love from our hearts

Floating gently by the window
Soon this dirty city will be
Covered with a new snow

Let's put on our winter boots
Go outside and play
Christmas can't be very far away

It's gonna be a cold one
I'll put on my wooly hat

Shining night and day

Go dream shopping in the mall
The kids can do the Santa thing
Photographs and all

We'll get the biggest tree this year
And trim it to the top
And spend a whole lot more
Than what we've got
But so what

Come next spring
I know we will be
Ready for the sunshine
Right now throwin' snowballs
At each other's such a fun time

This dark and lonely night
Tell me what best would help
To ease your mind
Someone to give
Direction for this unfamiliar road

I will lead you home""

How beautiful
How precious
The Savior of old
To love so
Completely
The loneliest soul

And I will lead you home
Trust Me and follow Me
And I will lead you home""

And I have a dream or two
Maybe they will come true

Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight
We'll wake up to a world of white
It's gonna be a christmas to remember
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole
Always sentimental and don't you know that
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember

I know it's true
Time doesn't stand still
Many things can change
But we know some things never will

The songs we always sing
The mystery of life
The hopefulness this season brings
And I have a dream or two
Maybe they will come true

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

Amy Grant,"They were the sweetest words I'd ever heard
My heart could barely take it in
Like water offered to the lips
Of a tired and thirsty man

'cause it's a tangled web of woven
I don't know all the reasons
But it amazes me to wake up
To your mercy every morning

So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing

'cause you say
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come onout
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are the steady arms of love 124

For the sake of never making waves I
Kept my secrets to myself
And no one ever really knew the
Darker shadows of my heart

But I will be a witness
That there's nothing in me dark enough
The power of forgiveness
Cannot resuce from the deep

So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing

Birds sing, ooh that sound
Reminds me of a line
From ""Unchained Melody""

Feel like I'm a little girl
Best thing in the whole wide world
Is I can see the makings of a memory
I remember how it used to be
Well I'm still dreaming

Cause I dream of simple things
I can believe in
Like the feeling this day brings
True love and the miracle of forgiving
I believe in simple things

Ain't nothing like a sunny day

Just paint the picture, baby
Where you want to be

Take a walk, take a ride
So far, you and I
Don't need a plan
But we can share
This revelry

I remember how I used to want it all
Funny how the big things seem so small

I dream of simple things
I can believe in

True love and the miracle of forgiving

With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone

They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum
And then they charged all the people
Twenty-five bucks just to see 'em

You give me spots on my apples

And a big yellow taxi carried off my old man

Everyone hurts to some degree
But while this world is fallin' apart

When you're without the one you need?

Waiting for you? Come be with me

Amy Grant,"Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee.
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies.
Well, I'm all grown up now,
But still need help somehow.
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream.

So here's my lifelong wish,
My grown-up Christmas list,
Not for myself, but for a world in need:

No more lives torn apart,
Then wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list.

As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree.
Well, heaven surely knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul.

No more lives torn apart,
And wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list.

What is this illusion called, the innocence of youth?
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth!

No more lives torn apart,
Then wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end

Nothing more than just a waif 
And he's mopping up his need

Maybe she'll find a way 
Through these awful years 
To disappear 

Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven 
Where did He go in the middle of her shame? 
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven 
I see no mercy, and no one down here's naming names 
Nobody's naming names

At a lovely woman face 
No more frightened little girl 
Like she's gone without a trace 
Still she leaves the light 
Burning in the hall 
It's hard to sleep at all 

Till she crawls up in her bed 
Acting quiet as a mouse 
Deep inside, she's listening 
For a creaking in the house 
But no one's left to harm her 
She's finally safe and sound 
There's a peace she has found 

Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven 
Where did He go in the middle of her shame? 
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven 
She said His mercy is bringing her life again 
She's coming to life again

The Night before Christmas
Has finally been read

Everything?s quiet under the tree
Baby, it?s Christmas for you and for me

Let?s light a candle
Put on some tunes
We?ve got til morning
To kiss and to spoon

I know you?re weary
We could both use some sleep
But, baby it?s Christmas
For you and for me.

Close your eyes darlin?
I?ll tell you when
I know you?re wonderin?
How much did I spend?

Let?s start unwrapping
Ribbons and lace
I see the want to
All over your face

I?ll always give you your favorite things
Baby, it?s Christmas for you and for me.
","Baby, It's Christmas"
Amy Grant,"When I'm worried and I can't sleep
I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I fall asleep counting my blessings
When my bankroll is getting small
I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep counting my blessings

I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds
If you're worried and you can't sleep
Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

Amy Grant,"I've made the same mistake before
Too many malls, too many stores
December traffic, Christmas rush
It breaks me till I push and shove

Children are crying while mothers are trying
To photograph Santa and sleigh
The shopping and buying and standing forever in line
What can I say?

I need a silent night, a holy night
To hear an angel voice through the chaos and the noise
I need a midnight clear, a little peace right here
To end this crazy day with a silent night

December comes then disappears
Faster and faster every year
Did my own mother keep this pace
Or was the world a different place?

Where people stayed home wishing for snow
Watching three channels on their TV
Look at us now rushing around
Trying to buy Christmas peace

I need a silent night, a holy night
To hear an angel voice through the chaos and the noise
I need a midnight clear, a little peace right here
To end this crazy day with a silent night

What was it like back there in Bethlehem
With peace on earth, good will toward men?

Every shepherd's out in the field
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And the glory of the Lord shone around them
And they were so afraid

And the angels said fear not for behold
I bring you good news of a great joy that shall be for all people
For unto you is born this day a Savior, who is Christ the Lord
And his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace

I need a silent night, a holy night
To hear an angel voice through the chaos and the noise
I need a midnight clear, a little peace right here

Amy Grant,"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upset.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack! You'll take the lead.",Jingle Bells
Amy Grant,"God loves a lullaby
In a mothers tears in the dead of night
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.
God loves a drunkards cry,
The soldiers plea not to let him die
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah.

The woman holding on for life,
The dying man giving up the fight
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes
The tears of shame for what's been done,
The silence when the words won't come
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes.

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah.

Better than a church bell ringing,
Better than a choir singing out, singing out.

Contemplatin' why nothin' turns out right.

What if that were my brown-eyed baby

Clinking and grinding into the dark
One of them passed with an open door
And I pictured myself jumping on board
What is the chance of that

A lonesome sound like a man in pain
Going somewhere they don't lose track
Some folks leave and they don't look back

That there were rules of cause and effect

Watered with tears
Waiting for signs of growth
Took months of days
And then took years.

We took our steps
We took our falls
Somewhere along the way
We just got lost
And we lost it all.

But nothing ventured, nothing gained
The risk of living is the pain

And sun and air to breathe

And some grew tall
And those surviving twenty winter thaws
Have the sweetest fruit of all.

Amy Grant,"I have travelled many moonless night
Cold and weary, with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father, you have come
And chosen me now
To carry your son

I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone,
Must I walk this path alone?
Be with me now 
Be with me now

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Light up my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For you are holy

Breath of heaven
Do you wonder as you watch my face
If a wiser one one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong 
Help me be
Help me

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Light up my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For you are holy

Hold me together
Be forever near me

Amy Hayashi-Jones,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon A Midnight Clear
Amy Holland,"I'm not strong enough 
Just to smile and make things easy
I can't put on that brave face anymore
I always took it for granted 
That I could take whatever you gave me
I guess you never really know for sure

'Cause there was never a doubt in my mind 
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to darlin', if you should leave 

[Chorus: ]
How do I survive if you break my heart
How do I survive if you break my heart

I've got no excuses for being your fool
I never thought that it would be forever
But after so much time together
I've come to depend on you
What else am I supposed to do

'Cause there was never a doubt in mind 
It wouldn't be easy
But I never realized how much you mean to me

I'm gonna break the chain you have tied around my neck 

I'm stomping out of here 
I hope the dishes rattle down off your shelf 
And if I see you first 
I'll run like hell 

Cause I don't need any kind of heartbreak resume 
This ain't the only trick I know despite what you may say 

You can't trick me back 
You can keep the change 
It isn't and will never be enough

All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out

And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all

How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss

Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed

But she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I paid
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I never seen that sweet smile
Or those eyes that dazzled from about a mile away
I never smelt that sweet scent
That followed you everywhere you went
Or even had the chance to call you mine

Now I look back in regret
At all the missed hours I spent
Watching my life just pass me by
Now your with somebody new
and there's nothing I can do
Just sit back and watch you smile.

I know your always gonna be there
But you don't see me there

Is move away from there",Somebody New [*]

The cold dark street tonight

Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?

And you're waiting outside jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home till 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do

And it's telling you the things that I never could.
And it's laying it down on the line for you.

And the years are catching up, I can see it on your face.

Are left there with the memories that blow in the wind.

They last all through the week, I feel it on Sunday too.
And I can feel it coming when my knees feel weak
And I can not speak the truth.

They're etched upon my face in every light that you see.

Where did they go? Did you take them all away?
Now I'm older and brave.

And the children, they all left. They fled their family nest.
And now we're all alone
And the house don't feel like home anymore, anymore.

Amy Millan,"Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark

No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school
As vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me
""Son, fear is the heart of love""
So I never went back

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me
Have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs

When your soul embarks

If the crowds hold back the rain 
I'll declare my intent 
To race again

I gave myself a ladder
This time for real

And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm
Just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to
And I've nothing to reveal

Go on, run for me
Go on, run for me

'Cause I can't take it back
Gone the summer, gone the past
And now it's gone, now it's gone

My road is paved with fear
I bathed myself in sweet grass
To tame the years

And I've nothing to reveal

You can't make your heart feel something it won't

And I can't make you love me

I'll close my eyes and then I won't see
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't

And I try to swim to dry land
To reach the shore,
It's a desert island and I wright help,

In the sand as large as I can,
That you ignore,

Waiting for ships to come take me away,

When I noticed the tide
Sure is coming in fast,
And I guess that this song
Really could be my last,

I feel like I'm stranded here with,
No-one to rescue me
Abandon by everyone I need,
I feel like you played me,
I feel like I'm such a fool,
Left stranded here by you, oh

So the quick sand is pulling me down,
You could throw that rope,
And could save me from dispare,
I was cast away you let me drown,
So I tried to scream but I bet
No-one would hear,

Put a message in a bottle
That you'll never read,
So this is the last song
That you'll get from me,

Waiting for ships to come take me away,

It wouldn't last forever
Always thought that I'd run into you
And we'd get back together
Now your here
Just like I imagined
But never once did it cross my mind
That you could move on
You've found someone
It breaks my heart
'cause you're so in love

I wish that my touch makes you smile just like that
And I wish that I had you the way that she has
'cause I still remember the love I left behind
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine

I think somebody's try'na talk to me
But I can't hear what they're saying
All I can do is stare at you
I don't even know why I'm staying
Never thought I'd cry to see you happy
It's just I thought that your happiness 
Was right here with me
I know we're through
It's no use
Still I can't help but feel

I wish that my touch
Makes you smile just like that (make you smile like that)
And I wish that I had you
The way that she has (the way that she has)
'cause I still remember the love
That I left behind (i left behind)
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine
The way that she has you (oh)
I wish that was me (i wish that was me)
There's no place on earth
That I'd rather be (rather be)
'cause I still remember the love
I left behind
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine

I used to be right beside you (oh no)
Now I'm not even kept inside your heart (oh no)
I put our love upon a shelf
But now it's gone
'cause you belong to someone else

I wish that my touch
Makes you smile just like that (i wish I was her)
And I wish that I had you 
The way that she has you (the way that she has you babe)
'cause I still remember the love 
That I left (i left oh I left behind)
Oh I wish I was her (i wish I was her)
And you were mine (oh I wish you were mine)

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

I will see my mother,
My sister and my father,
But my brother is going to hell

Well they hung him from the gallows,
As the sun turned red from yellow
The crowd they heard him halting,
And they sighed with much relief

The preacher asked him for any last words
My brother spit onto his clean shirt,
And he smiled without redemption and said,
""This is one soul God don't need""

Though I loved him, I won't miss him,
As he's burnin' and he's twistin',
For his heartless dedication
To the devil and its creed

As a child we called him rotten,
Till he was lonely and forgotten
And he revenged our constant jeering,
With his every word and deed

Oh and for my contribution,
And the soul's lack of retribution,
I would ask the Lord's forgiveness,
On my very bended knee

And its the tale of one bad seed",Johnny Rottentail

Amy Ray,"She comes down to Georgia to dance across my kitchen floor,
Leavin' black marks on linoleum, a country song on the radio
I am just a rodeo calf with tender feet and sewn on horns and
Love is a kindness that I've never known before,
I've never known before

She say's “I'm bound to Carolina to join the kids in ‘truth or dare'”
And she laughs and says its just a game when I tell her that I'm scared
I am just a dog waitin' at the kitchen door,
Love is a kindness that I've never known before,
I've never known before
Make it last, make it stay
Can you hold on long enough to make this pay

She said,” My daddy was a grifter and I was in my momma's way,
So I drifted for a while, because I could not stand to stay”
And she said, “Love is a kindness that I've never understood”
I said, “I‘ll give it to you willingly, its something you deserve,
Its something you deserve”

And I'll make it last, I'll make it stay
If you can hold on long enough I can make this pay

‘Cause I am just a calf with tender feet and sewn on horns,
Love is a prize waitin' on her at the rodeo",Rodeo
Amy Ray,"You ride your John Deere down to the pond
Just to watch me struggle along
You say you got your daddy's seed in you
And you think you're bored with anything there is to do with me

You wipe your hands across your bare chest
And rub your fingers through your crew cut hair
“Expelled from school,” you tell me with a grin,
“I copped a feel from an ex-girlfriend.”

I know you want to break the rules
We were made by nature's fools
And so you ride all day long, all by yourself,
‘Til you feel strong

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything I see

You wanna know why I had to go
Down to the baseball park to see you blow it
All the balls just fall from your hands,
And your daddy asks me, When is he gonna be a man?”

I know you want to change the truth
We were made by nature's fools
So you ride all night long
With your boys in those muscle cars
And you go down to the city
And laugh at the faggots
Until the girls look pretty and until you feel strong

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything that you could see

I'm just a magnet for the rural faggots
They come and knock on my door
Just to find they're running out of time
To figure out what they come here for

I know you want to know the truth
And I'm the dyke who will give it to you
By this time next year
You'll know you're queer
It'll all be okay
It'll all be clear
And you'll run away from home
But not to be alone
And you'll go down to the city
Where the boys are pretty

And where you feel strong
Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be

Amy Ray,"I'm a Sober Girl, not for any good reason
I found myself on this road I'm on
It felt a lot like treason
To my last girlfriends, who could never understand
When it comes to love, I wanted purity

I felt the loneliness of the world, in the city so I got out of there
I found myself at the end of a long dirt road
It felt a lot like nowhere
To my last girlfriends, who could never understand
When it comes to life, I wanted purity

When I was young, in every camptown song I sung
I was aching just to be
With someone, who could lay me down where the rivers run
Who was able, who was free

Free of this manmade world and all the bargains we made with fear
That slowly whittle us down to nothing
It felt a lot like despair
But I found someone, who was still standing when it was done
And with the purest heart, she said these words to me

Amy Ray,"There was something you gave
I'm sitting with as the seasons change
It lays unclaimed sometimes
Blame is a killer

I see the river that was and say what have I done
To see the forest for the trees
Truth is a villain

Did it steal you away from me
Or did they give me humanity?
Did they show me an autumn moon
When I needed my eyes of youth?

There's a big big love I need to be part of
I watch the leaves die while I wait
Time is unyielding

I see the days turn grey but for all our praying
We can't end this drought with rain
The gods are unwilling

Did it steal you away from me
Or did they give me humanity?
Did they show me an autumn moon
When I needed my eyes of youth?

Yeah you gotta roll brand new
And you gotta sing in tune
Yeah you got hands to hold
So many blooms to unfold

I hope nobody cries when I'm not there

Before the arctic ice was turning to sea
Before the polar bear was drifting helplessly?

it's a rollaway rollaway rollaway bed
Rolling away with your baby
And I'll take anything that'll help me sleep so save me save me
Save me a piece
Of the heart that pumps the blood right through your veins

She may be straight tonight but last night she let me hold her
It took a little bit of faith and a lot of patience
I got all night long and no reservations

Oh yeah alright
The Alabama kids are coming over tonight
They're gonna drive in into Georgia and rock us right
They say the ring in the tree shows a long line of passion
From the cotton fields to the emancipation

Baby are you gonna treat me right?

I hang with the deviants and the tranny nation
They don't take the names their mama gave em
They've been so fucked with they've got nothing to lose

Amy Ray,"Baby's got a lot of tears
Enough to cry a thousand years
Enough to cry a thousand seas
Enough to break a boy like me
I want to stand and deliver
And be the one that makes it better

All I've got's this little heart
With growing pains and leaky parts
All I've got's this little cup
I pour it out she fills it up
It tastes so sweet and so bitter
Why can't I just be with her?

In the time that we're apart
I figured out what makes it hard
All the words they go away
I can't face another day
Without the one who breaks my heart
And gets to touch the tender parts

Baby's got a lot of love
Enough to fill the sky above
Enough to make the sunlight shine
Enough to leave it all behind
I want to shine I want to shimmer
Receive the love that makes it better

But all I've got's this little chalice
Born of fear and forged with malice
All I've got's this coat of mail, in
It's time it served me well
It's useless now as I wither
Why can't I just deliver?

Amy Ray,"You say we've got this mountain we have to climb
I'm hungry and out of time

And a reason to be free

Someone played too hard
I didn't
Someone stole your dreams

Someone got there a long time before me

You say we've got this long road that lays ahead
It's gonna take a lot of tread
'Cause I've been walking it all my life
I still can't get it right
Guess I need a reason to believe
In faith and apologies
'Cause I've known them all my life
I still can't see the light

You turn to me at night

Like you think everything's alright

And it is til we turn on the light

And real life returns

And I don't want flowers or fancy things

I gave up on a diamond ring



All I want

I just want a little hug and a kiss from you

Not a list of things I didn't do

I just want a little something

To show me that you care whether I live or die

All I want

For you to tell me that you're liking the dress I'm in

Not criticize me cause my life is a mess again

All I want is tell me it's alright

As is, for less

Paying full price would be happiness

That hasn't been marked down...twice

All that Versace is really a waste

I've been so sick and sad

I miss my mom, I lost my dad

My life's a soap opera, it's so apalling

I wanna drive and drink, don't like the thoughts that I think

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?



Maybe there's a place where I can go

Somewhere to make it all make sense

I'll find to feed the dogs

And jump the fence



Doing t'ai chi in the morning

Doesn't seem to help me

I wanna dance but I'm not fit for crawling

I've been so lonely lately, even waitresses won't date me

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?



I'm out of cigarettes

When you walked by

I thought you were the one that loved me

And made me cry

I see you're not, but that's okay

Maybe we could try it any way

For new times' sake



Excuse my haste

I know we just met

But you're reminding me of someone

I can't forget

He's in the past, you're here with me

I got scared cause there was nobody there

I'm invisible, yeah invisible

I'm who I used to be but nobody sees me

I walked into a bar, now what was I thinking?

Nobody asked me ""Honey, what are you drinking?""

I'm invisible, oh shit I'm invisible!

Since I hit 35, what I want I gotta buy

I'm invisible



I put some makeup on, I dress like someone half my age

I write it in a song, I even get up on the stage

I'm still invisible, well...invisible

I say to hell with my pride, I haven't got a thing to hide

Cause I'm invisible



I was standing by the ocean in my brand new bathing suit

I said ""She's cute alright, I hope your sunburn peels tonight""

But of couse these monitors can lie

Nine times out of ten occurences of base attraction

Strictly for the sake of argument

Were you to relax approximate to my location

Do you think said time would be well spent?



I admit I feel the urge to touch you

Probably a pre-programmed response

Satifies the needs, negates the want



I cannot refute the role of mystery

But didn't have the energy

To tell a soul 'cept you and you and me

Selling off Fiesta plates

Ate loaves of bread but gained no weight

From pecan waffles on the roof

The summer of my wasted youth



Summertime in '83

The last time I took LSD

But listening to Patsy Cline

And Skeeter David really blew my mind

Played the boombox in the courtyard

Never used a credit card

Still took a trip by Greyhound bus

The summer I believed in us



Pushed plaster cows down city streets

Wore thrift store skirts with little pleats

Smoked pot and sat around all day

Bought a guitar but didn't try to play



Summertime in '83

I didn't need a j-o-b

Cause unemployment kept me free

To study country harmony

And find somebody with a car

Drink cheap beer in the Polish bar

Take photos in the photo booth

Seemed that id had gone away

Ain't been used since who knows when

Instead of feeling like I'm once removed

The way that other people seem to do

Instead I'm waiting for the next goodbye

Most of the time I'm well-protected

I move along from day to day

I've worked it out oh so carefully

It's all about two people who

Will only do what they want to do

And though nobody else has yet succeeded

We could be the first to get what we both need

Without a compromise



We won't expect too much

“It's optional” will be our mantra

Forget that couple stuff

We're giving nothing up

And getting what we want



Traditional is out of date

The perfect match and the soul mate

The time is here to blaze a trail

If things get weird we can always bail

There'll be no need to keep our best intentions

We'll dispose of all those moldy old conventions



We won't expect a lot

Commitment-free will be our motto

We'll go with what we've got

We're giving nothing up

And giving it a shot



Oh should we find emotion creeping in

We'll deal with it then

",The Deal
Amy Rigby,"I took a walk in a small town Sunday morning

Just to see what was going on

Sat watching two guys fishing in the river running through

Like there was nothing wrong, nothing wrong

They had their lines in the water ten feet apart

Beer guts, t-shirts, me with my heavy heart

I don't have religion but I'm trying to pray

And I never liked fishing but I wanted to stand up and say



Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change

Don't ever change

Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change



I picked my daughter up at school last week

She had her headphones on, she barely said hello

And all I wanted was to hug her, smother her with kisses

But I was cool, like hi there, how did it go?

She had chipped nail polish, writing on her hand

She was nodding her head to her favorite band

Staring into space like she was all alone

But I didn't take it personal

It meant that I was home and I said



Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change

Don't ever change

Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change

Don't ever change



I'm holding on to everything that's good in this world

There's a lot that's good in this world



I saw my baby sitting there at the breakfast table

His hair a mess and he forgot to shave

And I wished that he would get up, make it all better

Stop drinking so much, learn how to behave

Then the radio was playing a Chuck Berry song

And he was looking at me asking what was wrong

I made a list of the things I could say

But he gave me a wink and it all went away, I told him



Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change

Don't ever change

Hey I love you, you're perfect, don't ever change

Don't ever change

",Don't Ever Change
Amy Rigby,"I know you think she's heartless and she's cruel

You're probably right

She's never made someone else play the fool

She practiced all night

With a chair and rug her phone unplugged and The Rules



So do yourself a favor when you meet

You know that you might

Even though you'll never save her don't retreat

Look on the bright side

It's ugly now but you'll make it out alive

Why would anyone board the ride

Makes you wish you were callous and thick

So there's things you would never have known

Bully for her

And you'll kindly blur the details of the end

To love we never made

We live in parallel
Across the empty blue
We are like earth and sun
And I still circle you

Soledad - Como la luna
Soledad - Esperando te aqui
Soledad - Toda mi vida
No me olvido de ti

I let you slip away
Like golddust throught my hands
But every night you hold me close
In a shadow dance",Soledad
Amy Sky,"Up on the east side
To the west side
Across the city
The great divide
Nights are long if you
Ain't got the money
The streets are empty as an exit sign
You paint by numbers tonight
But it ain't worth the fight

[Chorus]
You're just half of a heart
Until you love somebody
You don't know who you are
Until you love somebody
Until you love someone

Is that a torch baby
Or just a candle
The lights are burning
But there's no-one there
Is it fire that you
You just can't handle
Could it be that you just might care
You've got my name on your lips
See man and let it slip

Throw a line and I'll pull you in
Oh yeah cause it's sink or swim
Give it up baby
See man give me your heart, yeah, yeah

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

And I hope that deep inside you feel it too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky lit with diamonds
When I make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will feel brand new
Tonight we will both discover 
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

Sand and water, and a million years gone by

I will hear you in the sound of the waves
I will know you when I come, as we all will come,
Through the doors, beyond the grave

All alone, I raise this child
Flesh and bone, he's just
Bursting towards tomorrow

Amy Studt,"""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

[Chorus:]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

[Chorus:]

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell ya, that your the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard",All I Wanna Do

Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe

Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Amy Winehouse,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide

There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye, bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story

(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through

(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Your priority, it must be heard

While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",You Sent Me Flying/Cherry

And you didn't even get no taste 

Don't be too upset 
If they call you a skank 
'cause like the news everyday you get pressed 

You don't like players 
That's what you say-a 
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire 
Or them big ballers 
Don't do nothing for ya 
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller 

You can't sit down right 
'cause you jeans are too tight 
And your lucky its ladies night 

With your big empty purse 
Every week it gets worse 
At least your breasts cost more than hers 

So you did Miami 
'cause you got there for free 
But somehow you missed the plane 

You did too much E 
Met somebody 
And spent the night getting cane 

Without girls like you 
There'd be no fun 
We'd go to the club and not see anyone 
Without girls like you 
There's no nightlife 
All those men just go home to their wives 

Don't be mad at me 
'Cause your brushing thirty 
And your old tricks no longer work 

You should have known from the job 
That you always get dumped 
So dust off your fuck me pumps",F*** Me Pumps [MJ Cole Mix][*]
Amy Winehouse,"She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row

She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

[Chorus]

So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold",Fool's Gold [B-Side][*]

Tough to sort files with your voice in my head

How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb

It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be

Although my pride, yeah, is  not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such

You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind

Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around

Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around",'Round Midnight
Amy Winehouse,"You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you everyday
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy

He said, ""The respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said, ""You don't know what love is, get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy

I don't have a key for downstairs

And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way

And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly

I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you

Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'

He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa

If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to

If my man was fighting",Some Unholy War

Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty

Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head

[Chorus]
I can't help but analyze your actions,
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on new years eve

[Chorus: x2]

I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn't I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget

But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips

I'm confused and quizzical

I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good

It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight

Amy Winehouse,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""Why did you do it with him today?""
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good",You Know I'm No Good

Amy Winehouse,"You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

Amy Winehouse,"Wish I could say it breaks my heart 
Like you did in the beginning 
Its not that we grew apart 
A nightingale no longer singing 

Its something I know you can't do 
Separate sex with emotion 
I sleep alone the sun comes up 
Your still clinging to that notion 

Every thing is slowing down 
River of no return 
Recognize my every sound 
There is nothing new to learn 

you'll never get my mind right 
Like 2 ships passing in the night 
In the night, in the night 
Want the same thing where we lay 
Otherwise mines a different way 
A different way from where I'm going 
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion 
So sorry if I turn my head 
Yours is a familiar face 
But that don't make your place safe 
In my bed my bed my bed 

I never thought my memory 
Of what we had could be intruded 
But I couldn't let it be 
I needed it as much as you did 

Now its not hard to understand 
Why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand 
Is to get the angle right 
Everything is slowing down 
River of no return 
You recognize my every sound 
There's nothing new to learn 

you'll never get my mind right 
Like 2 ships passing in the night 
In the night in the night 
Want the same thing where we lay 
Otherwise mines a different way 
A different way from where I'm going 
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion 
So sorry if I turn my head 
Yours is a familiar face 
But that don't make your place safe 
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed","In My Bed [Live at Concorde, Brighton, 2008]"
Amy Winehouse,"Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think, I'm tryin' not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Oh, teach me tonight

Let's start with the A B C of it
Roll right down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a black board
High above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come on and teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me, please, teach me tonight","Teach Me Tonight [Live, Hootenanny, London, 2004]"
Amy Winehouse,"I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown

But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong

At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams

You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?",Hey Little Rich Girl
