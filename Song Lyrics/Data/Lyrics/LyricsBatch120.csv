Fish,"When the taxis gather in mock solemnity.
Funeral hearses court the death of virginity,
Was it paradise lost or paradise found?
Did we gain respect or were we holding ground?
You had found true love, or so you believed
And the wide boys tattooed your hearts upon their sleeves.

So when you think it`s time to go,
when you think it`s time to go,
Don`t be surprised, the heroes never show.

And the patter merchants selling false impressions,
Tipping eyes at the waitress with American expressions,
Tie angels to the bar with sweet Martini`s and their charms
They`re lying on every word and every arm
They`re turning down their noses to the best lines
And the cheap wines.
And the wide boys,
They wear their love bites for their crimes.

So when you think it`s time to go,
When you think it`s time to go,
Don`t be surprised, the heroes never show.",Waterhole (Expresso Bongo) [Multimedia Track]
Fish,"When I hit the streets back in '81,
Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown
I felt barbed-wire kisses and icicle tears,
Where have I been for all these years?

I saw political intrigue, political lies,
Gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes

I will wear your white feather
I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation
But I'm proud to own my heart
I will wear your white feather
I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation
But I'm proud to own my heart
My heart, this is my heart

We don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise,
Divided we stand, together we'll rise

We will wear your white feather
We will carry your white flag
We will swear we have no nations
But we're proud to own our hearts
We will wear your white feather
We will carry your white flag
We will swear we have no nations
But we're proud to own our hearts
These are our hearts
These are our hearts
You can't take away our hearts
You can't steal our hearts away

I can't walk away
I can't walk away
No more, no more, no more, no more...",White Feather [Multimedia Track]
Fish,"Listen to me just hear me out, if I could have your attention
Just quieten down for a voice in the crowd.
I get so confused I don't understand
I know you feel the same way you've always wanted to say

But you don't get the chance, just a voice in the crowd.
I don't know the score anymore; it's not clear anymore
I can't tell right from wrong anymore; I just don't understand.
I was sitting here thinking of exchanging a new world for old

Like changing channels on the tv, or the dirt we stand in to gold.
When I was young, my father told me just the bad guys die
At the time just a little white lie
It was one of the first but it hurt me the most

And the truth stung like tears in my eye
That even the good guys must die
There's no reasoning no crimes and I never knew why
Even now it still makes me cry.

If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little helping hand just a little understanding
Just some answers to the questions that surround me now.
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line

Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you
I keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors
Where nothing here is ever what it seems

You stand so close but you never understand it
For all that we see is not what it seems, am I blind?
And you sit there and talk revolution
But can you tell me just who's in command?

When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans
But for now only our t-shirts cry freedom
And our voices are gagged by our greed

Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed
And if that's not what you believe
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone

That I'm not just a voice in the crowd
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little helping hand just a little understanding
Just a little understanding to the questions that I'm asking you

If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you
I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors

Where nothing here is ever what it seems
I'm scared to shout in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon, that is truth

Day by day it's getting louder
And day by day it's getting stronger
But when I can't scream no more and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.
(And the boy stood, and stared at the hill. And the hill stared back)",Vigil [DVD]
Fish,"Good morning, good afternoon
And what have you got to say?
Well, I'm waiting but I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day

There's a time to be talking
And there's a time when it's no use
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse

I've just gone solo
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo?

What a wonderful way to live
She's traveling all over the world
Why the flame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled

But no time for the gent with the Milliner Bentley
And heaven knows what else
Why he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil wells

She just went solo
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?

I've always lived in a Maison
On the other side of the moon
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune

I could tell you that the grass
Is really greener on the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will

We've all gone solo
We all play solo
Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?

Ain't life a solo?

Fish,"I found a new religion yesterday, I'd just cleared immigration JFK
A priest got in a Cadillac, the shoe shine boy sang gospel
As God and his accountants drove away.
You'll see him coast to coast on live tv, in a stadium
Rocked by Satan just the night before
The collection from the faithful is tax free
It'll pay for his presidential campaign and his yacht
And we all bow down, we bow down to the big wedge
And we'll buy ourselves some heaven on earth
We sell our souls, sell our souls for big wedge
Are we selling out tomorrow for today?
A surgeon checks your plastic on the telephone
A Casio concerto entertains you while you hold
Your credit rating's good for a Madonna or a Bardot
A Dali or a Picasso for his wall.
You're looking good, looking good with big wedge
Are you holding back tomorrow for today?
They're driving in, driving in with big wedge
Are we selling out tomorrow for today?
You'll sell the ground beneath your feet
You'll sell your oil, you'll sell your trees
You ideals and integrity your culture and your history
Your children into slavery to labor in their factories
Your mother and your family
You'll sell the world eventually.
The IMF and CIA; there's just no difference they're all the same!
It just depends on what's your point of view
America, America the big wedge
And they're buying up your tomorrow with promises
The promises of big wedge and they'll break them
Like your hearts another day
When you find out that you've left it just too late
And find that you're the only one to blame
That you sold out your tomorrow for Big Wedge",Big Wedge [DVD]
Fish,"Tattoo Shop,
Hi, Doc
Hey Fish, what are you doin'?
If you don't mind we're gonna record this
Is that cool?

Oh, that's cooler 'n hell
Hell yeah, 52's biggest dream man
You know his biggest dream was
Me and him go party with you

On the trail of torn out twisters
Two angels on a mission came
Dust devils danced before them
In the path of the hurricane

On the road to Oklahoma
Through the flatlands from L.A.
From the shadows in the valley
From a country where the lizards play

While they drove they kept the radio on
Why don't you sing along, sing along, sing along?

Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo

Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, Brother 52
I don't think so

A man stands behind his shadow
A man stands behind his words
These men are together with family
To defend their rights in another man's world

Most people stood against them
Most people disagreed
With the need for all those weapons
In our safe, secure society

Paint the words and the pictures on another man's skin
We are lovers, warriors, magician kings

Well, I don't think so, don't think so

Fuckin' brilliant, man
Okay, here's what happened

52 barred the door shut from the inside
A gunfight started on the front porch
52 shot back

You know they come into his home with it
So he's protecting himself
The guy inside the house blew his brains out

Yeah, they made it look like he killed himself
But no one believes he would
'Cause he's not that kind of man, that's all

I think, he wasn't afraid of death
You know, he believed in something to die for
That's what he did

Some say he had it coming
Others say he was sole to blame
But who says they've got the rights
If any at all to blow the brothers away

A man got a right to wonder
A man got a right to dream
Without looking over his shoulder
To choose the manner of the life he leads

What they have done
Was they've come in and murdered him
For his bombs and his ammunition

Just like that Waco Texas
Or any of these other things
Over here in the United States

Anybody that's stockpiling firearms and ammunitions
Is a threat to the government
So the government wages war against us

They tortured him, he went out
But I'm sure he stood up
Like he was supposed to, you know?

They smashed all the rings
Shut on his fingers with a hammer
It was all an orchestrated plan, man

The more the closer I was getting to it to the truth
The more they got everybody looking at me
As being the guy that pulled the trigger

And what they did when they killed 52
Is they broke the whole family up
That's exactly what they wanted to do
They wanted to break all of us up",Brother 52 [DVD]

Would sort your life out?
What's the difference?

Lose.

Difference?

Fish,"I'd be really pleased to meet you if only I could remember your name
But I got problems with my memory ever since I got a winner in the fame game
I'm a citizen of Legoland travellin' Incommunicado
And I don't give a damn for the Fleet Street aficionados

But I don't want to be the back page interview
I don't want launderette anonymity
I want my hand prints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard
A dummy in Tussauds you'll see. Incommunicado

I'm a Marquee veteran, a multi-media bonafide celebrity
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight and responsibility
I'm a rootin' tootin' cowboy, a Peter Pan with street credibility
Always making the point with the dawn patrol fraternity

Sometimes it seems like I've been here before
When I hear opportunity kicking in my door
Call it synchronicity call it de ja vu
I just put my faith in destiny it's the way that I choose

But I don't want to be a tin can tied to the bumper of a wedding limousine,
Or currently residing in the where-are-they-now file
A toupe on the cabaret scene
I want to do adverts for American Express cards
And talk shows on prime time TV,
A villa in France
My own cocktail bar
And that's where you're gonna find me

Evening standard: late one!...

Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress
Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town
Awaiting the prince in his white capri
Dynamic young tarzan courts the bedsit queen

She's playing the actress in this bedroom scene
She's learning her lines from glossy magazines
Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen

Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile
But for now it's just another chelsea Monday, chelsea monday.

Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of london,
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause,
To chelsea Monday

She'll pray for endless sundays as she enters saffron sunsets
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn,
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the st. tropez mirage
Fragrant aphrodisiac, the withered tuberose,
Of chelsea Monday, sweet chelsea Monday

Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile
But for now it's just another chelsea Monday, sweet chelsea Monday

(spoken:) hello john, did you see the standard about four hours ago?
Fished a young chick out of the old father
Blond hair, blue eyes
She said she wanted to be an actress or something
Nobody knows where she came from, where she was going
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face
She was smiling
What a waste!

Buried in her cellophane world in glitter town,

It's somewhere deep within our consciousness
Is it a new beginning, for those who need a second chance
Maybe then we'll find out why we did

You all had put it there

We lived a life once we felt together as one
And now those days are gone

We fled that place there was a beast kept there
He was mighty and strong and his name was jealousy
We all laughed we felt we would rise above with our unity, our unity

That I have a friend and his name is envy

Yet she decrees I am less than human

But it`s my soul that satisfies her hunger

The `prefects` make their margin call
Will you join the ranks of sheep
That will not a soul to keep
Their premise is intelligence
Profaned by human arrogance
If you stand against it all...
Make the bastards fall...

End the reign!

Who are your true enemies ?
Is it those you do not know...
Or the ones you can`t control
Does joy excite every nerve

Do you have the strength at all

Fishbone,"Love, hate

Love is deep within your gut
Struck with fire to the touch
Hate is when you can't relate
In a different state to hate, revenge
Execute pain to the thief of love

Filled with hate, I won't mistake
Inside out pin love is grand
Outside in pain, hate awaits

Ain't love grand? It saves the human
Sometimes love is never finished
Some times hate is never ending
Love and hate, too close for most
But revenge can make it even

Love, hate

Love to hate to love to kill
By the will of loving to hate
Kill the love with your fear and then
The revenge will set in

Revenge, quench the hate in the mean time
But in the end your soul will end
Like a junkie that needs his shot
Hate revenge the brotha's twins

Love is solid and won't go nowhere
Love will stay as sure as life lives
Love will stay it's crept in everywhere
Love, hate, too close for most
But revenge can make it even

Revenge is gained when hate kills love
Love rises above because love is the dove
Love and hate both are the same
Causing the extreme opposites of the same pain

When we meet on the fields of onions
To make war brings tears to my eyes
Love and hate brings tears to my eyes
When love dies hate will arise

It's a loving hate for the hate that loves
Love's to hate for a loveless hate
For a hateless love
Rather than the hate filled hate

But no love, man
That's impossible
That's preposterous
That's polukaism
Halt

If hate was a hat holding back
The hovering hate less hate
Un-hate yourself
Of this hate hat

And let the hate less love
Lift loud and lovable
That's been looming
Under your hate hat
Of  helter skelter

Love don't loath, live and love
Happy not hate
Happy joy love and happiness cool no heat
Hate is the enemy

Hate will arise for you to despise
Hate is laughing at your fate
Love is beautiful and it is potent
Love inhibits the inhabitant of love
Love is the permanent state
Hate is for the late freight

Peace, love and hate can definitely relate

A SEL-E-E-E-E-CTION
You get on the commercial for the t.v. tube
Bob Barker asks you which vehicle you would choose
You want the Cadillac or BMW
And you say O-O-O-O-O-O-OKAY!!
You go out on a date with your fiancee
The pretty little lady with the eyes of gray
You go to the bathroom to brush your teeth
WHAT! NO TOOTHPASTE?!?
(Repeat chorus)
You have to go to New york on a business trip
On train, a plane, a car, or ocean ship
Or you become a rock star and your mind will flip
A choice of psychedelic drugs or groovy chicks
You buy a pack of bubblegum from the store
With two, or three, or four, or five pieces or more
You take out the last piece to put in your mouth
But you select the first piece
Yes, you have made a selection

She heard a noise and she looked through the door

Light skin light blue eyes a double chin and a plastic smile
Well her eyebrow raised as he walked through the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""my brand new car is parked right outside. how'd ya like to go for a ride?""

Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, "" she lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him 25 years
And now his heart is filled with tears

He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

Maybe a small ""hello"" from LA

Had to cry

I can recall every face that I have ever kissed
How did I fall on your ""Miss Miscellaneous"" list?

And wake up and Mary is still gone.

To leave before the party?

That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together

Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

To show them you are nothing
Won't you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Walk the line or society will swallow us whole
Fall behind and let the hate consume you

The strong they stand up for their sons and daughters
The weak they flee from the sight of martyrs

Me acuerdo que abrí la puerta y eras vos, después me perdí
Mirándote desnuda y te reías de mí cara de maldad
Entonces sentí la cima del amor, y si me caí
No, importa porque todo, todo, todo, todo esto es de los dos
           
No quiero na-da que nos halga mal, yo creo

Ahí voy, aún siento esa sensación 
Ahí voy, ese touch en el alma 
Ahí voy, irse por primera vez
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 

Rosa se quedó en san pablo, haciéndole a un amigo un favor 
La cogieron con dos kilos, antes de que despegue el avión 
Rosa es una buena, es una buena chica, con un gran corazón 
Cuando se soltó del brazo, mi amor, algo en ella se rompió 

Dany tiene un cuentagotas, de gotas que no caen al mar 
Si le quitan las pastillas, hay voces que empiezan a hablar 
Un cable conectó directo con algo mas allá 
Dany quiere irse muy pronto, para no volver jamás 

Ahí voy, llegando a ningún lugar 
Ahí voy, yo sigo al remango 
Ahí voy, canalla de corazón 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 

Ahí voy, con mis muertos, con mi dolor 
Ahí voy, la vista adelante 
Ahí voy, cayendo en la tentación 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 

Ahí voy, y vos venís conmigo 
Ahí voy, caballero errante 
Ahí voy, a ver pibe
Te juego un pulso a ver quien se mete más tragos esta noche 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 

Ahí voy, pateando en la tempestad 
Ahí voy, echando abogados 
Ahí voy, yo también me escapé una vez 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 
Las cosas no cambiaron tanto 
Ahí voy

Fito Páez,"Me gusta estar a un lado del camino
Fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta abrir los ojos y estar vivo
Tener que vérmelas con la resaca
Entonces navegar se hacer preciso
En barcos que se estrellen en la nada
Vivir atormentado de sentido
Creo que ésta, sí, es la parte mas pesada

En tiempos donde nadie escucha a nadie
En tiempos donde todos contra todos
En tiempos egoístas y mezquinos
En tiempos donde siempre estamos solos
Habrá que declararse incompetente
En todas las materias de mercado
Habrá que declararse un inocente
O habrá que ser abyecto y desalmado
Yo ya no pertenezco a ningún istmo
Me considero vivo y enterrado
Yo puse las canciones en tu walkman
El tiempo a mi me puso en otro lado
Tendré que hacer lo que es y no debido
Tendré que hacer el bien y hacer el daño
No olvides que el perdón es lo divino
Y errar a veces suele ser humano

No es bueno nunca hacerse de enemigos
Que no estén a la altura del conflicto
Que piensan que hacen una guerra
Y se hacen pis encima como chicos
Que rondan por siniestros ministerios
Haciendo la parodia del artista
Que todo lo que brilla en este mundo
Tan sólo les da caspa y les da envidia
Yo era un pibe triste y encantado
De Beatles, caña Legui y maravillas
Los libros, las canciones y los pianos
El cine, las traiciones, los enigmas
Mi padre, la cerveza, las pastillas los misterios el whisky malo
Los óleos, el amor, los escenarios
El hambre, el frío, el crimen, el dinero y mis 10 tías
Me hicieron este hombre enreverado

Si alguna vez me cruzas por la calle
Regálame tu beso y no te aflijas
Si ves que estoy pensando en otra cosa
No es nada malo, es que pasó una brisa
La brisa de la muerte enamorada
Que ronda como un ángel asesino
Mas no te asustes siempre se me pasa
Es solo la intuición de mi destino

Me gusta estar a un lado del camino
Fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta regresarme del olvido
Para acordarme en sueños de mi casa
Del chico que jugaba a la pelota
Del 49585
Nadie nos prometió un jardín de rosas
Hablamos del peligro de estar vivo
No vine a divertir a tu familia
Mientras el mundo se cae a pedazos
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Me gusta sentirte a mi lado
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Dormirte cada noche entre mis brazos
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Es mas entretenido y mas barato
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino",Al Lado del Camino
Fito Páez,"Ya ha corrido mucha agua debajo de este puente
Me ha sobrado y me ha faltado inspiración
Puede ser que suene muy desafinado

Y fundirme con tu espíritu divino
Y sentir que, si, se puede ser feliz

Times are changing
Times are changing
Times are still changing
They are changing for me

A todos algo ya nos ha golpeado duro
Y vimos algo tras el velo del amor
Pero es que ya no soy tan chico ni tan puro
Que hasta me parece ingenuo el rock and roll

He perdido y he encontrado mi cabeza
Despertándome en el charcho de la sangre del mezcal
Con la cara un poco mas desfigurada
Ten cuidado con las mezclas y a no desanimar

Times are changing
Times are changing
Times are still changing
They are changing for me

Es genial por fin haber tocado fondo
Porque ya no se puede bajar mucho mas
Ves ese hilo de luz que está ahí arriba
Es tu buena estrella, te protegerá

Entonces cuando todo al fin se vuelve insoportable
Cuando el mundo y el veneno dan dolor
Todavía sigue allí tu buena estrella
Buena estrella para todos, para vos

Times are changing
Times are still changing

Yo también jugué muy sucio

Pero es que es que existe una ley

Los zapatos ya no me los puedo poner

Que murió estaqueado, solo, entre los cuervos desangrado

Que pasó en la argentina 
Es la casa desaparecida 
Argentina, argentina 
Bienvenidos a casa argentina, 
A la desaparecida 

Soy paragua de la villa 21 
Yo te la mamo, yo te hago todo lo que vos querés 
El sargento ibarra se me ha enamorado 
Los domingos paga el whisky y el hotel 
Y yo le robo la pistola cuando duerme 
Y me voy a godoy cruz, a godoy cruz y santa fe 
A cuidar de la ramona y de los pibes 
Que te besan, te roban, te cuidan entre las vías del tren 

Entre rosas y sarmiento, don segundo y martín fierro 
La barbarie y los modales europeos 
El país de los inventos, maradona, 
Los misterios del lenguaje metafísico del gran resentimiento 
Bienvenidos inmigrantes a este paraíso errante 
Ya se sabe que el que no arriesga no gana 
Y esa casa que dejaron escapando entre las balas 
Era el caldo del cultivo a la nostalgia 
En el reino del silencio cavernario de oropeles 
Un concilio de miserias, de rodilla en los cuarteles 
Y hubo una fiesta de todos, embriagada, delirante 
No te metas, algo habrá hecho ese maleante 
Yo volví con onganía y la cosa aún seguía 
Aristócratas patricios y patricias de anchorena 
Tan católicos mamones, protagonistas sin roles 
Yendo tras de un socialismo patriotero, sindicalista 
Preparados todos para aterrizar en pista 
Ya vacíos los aviones, transformados en camiones 
De intereses, balas tristes 
Y vecinas que no entienden que ha pasado 
En este barrio tan tranquilo, tan callado y quien dió 
La orden de cambiar el mundo 
De leer antena en la peluquería 
A jamás volver a sentir alegría 
Madres muy desesperadas cocinaban y planchaban 
Hoy sus hijos son caníbales fantasmas 
Los cadáveres se guardan o se esconden en el río 
En palacios de memoria ensangrentada 
Y tenemos pijas grandes, largas como mil facones 
Y anacrónicas arengas, melancólicas uniones 
La bandera enloquecida, maten a los maricones 
Que los hombres van de putas para sentirse varones 

Siempre el padre omnipresente de mirada contundente 
Que escondía un seductor muy asexuado 
Gracias papi por las flores, por las reivindicaciones 
Vos sabés los hijos nunca te fallamos 
Y si mami aún viviera, hoy sería jardinera 
En el cementerio club de las pasiones 
Yo que nunca anduve en nada, nunca me metí en política 
Simplemente fui un muchacho hedonista 
Y chiquitos y chiquitas inocentes con un arma 
Por el odio mas brutal descuartizados 
El mas fuerte penaliza, pega duro, te hace trizas 
Nada personal, naturaleza humana 
Los poderes organizan cual será la repartija de 
Los bienes de la época 

Nadie se puede salvar, nadie se puede salvar 

Sigo vivo, sigo atento, y observando con el tiempo 
Esta extraña enfermedad inclasificada 
Que te afecta muy deprisa, que te quita la sonrisa 
Cuyo síntoma es que ya no importa nada 

Argentino hasta la muerte, 
La patilla de facundo recortada de la gente, de la caras 

Y seguir comiendo mierda, cada día, cada noche 
Y explicarle al mundo entero nuestra nada de la historia universal 
De la argentina ensimismada 
Que contiene enciclopedia de uno mismo 
Y encender con la birome palabritas en el cielo, 
En el campo las espinas 
Y en el centro de mi pecho hay un bicho que camina 

Hoy la casa de mi infancia ya no existe ni hace falta 
Yo la llevo bien adentro en mis entrañas 
Toda llena de colores y de desapariciones 
Muy tempranas, muy profundas, muy amargas 

Nada ha desaparecido 
Ni la casa con 10 pinos 
Ni mi amor, ni la zamba de mi esperanza 
Es que el mundo es muy cretino 
Pero puede ser divino, si yo quiero 
Porque nada en este mundo me hace falta 
Nada mas que algunos trucos 
Un conejo, una galera, un colchón, un tocadisco y una mesa 
Y es posible que los hijos puedan cambiar lo que hicimos 
Y la casa nunca mas desaparezca

Mi circulo abierto, mi tacto de oro 
Tu espalda es un arpa, tus piernas un coro 
Que tienen en mente hacérmelo todo
Yo soy ese rayo que cayó del cielo 
Que vino a quemarte hasta el mismo infierno 
Vos sos el espacio que habitan tus miedos 
Yo tengo coraje y tengo deseo 

Quiero tu lado salvaje, no necesito palabras 
Quiero sacarme las ropas, que no me sirven de nada

No me provoques ahora, tengo un cuchillo con filo 
Y nada de lo que me digas, amor, va a sacarme de este

Hay gente que aspira la coca y el tiempo

Cuando sólo vemos bruma

Viejos que leí pero olvidé 

Besos de tu madre en el teléfono 
Y la lluvia es un espejo que me ayuda a verte bien

Entre las copas y el café

Un pobre pobre, un pobre diablo 
Nosotros éramos los niños endiablados del amor 
De las familias más argentinas 
No nos dormimos sin rezar el padre nuestro al redentor 

El niño ausente, el proletario 
Traía en la sangre mil generaciones del peor alcohol 
Entre los fierros, entre los sapos 
Entre el calor casi demente del arroyo seco, arróyalo 
Lo convencimos, lo enamoramos 
Y le juramos que jamás se olvidaría de nosotros 
Y así le hicimos comer el barro 
Tragar la mugre misma con la que se había alimentado 
Y así le hicimos beber espanto

Y nos reímos, nos animamos

Y fui precioso, tan kamikaze 
Yo fui calígula y él fue la virgen que este dios violó 
Lo liquidamos tan de repente

Directo a donde explotan las estrellas
Hay algo en el mundo que no puedo explicar
Y que me hace temblar las piernas

Son tus ojos el mar
Donde se ahogan mis penas, nena
Hay algo en el mundo
Sos vos en mi mundo 

Hay algo en el mundo que nos hace pensar 
Que al final todo sirvió para nada
Hay algo en el mundo despiadado y brutal
Que nos afila la mirada
No hay nada en el mundo que me quite el dolor
Cuando la muerta despliega alas
Hay algo en el mundo
Sos vos en mi mundo

Que suenen las campanas, que vuele el cardenal
Brindemos en la cama y revolquémonos en sal
Porque el mundo esta vivo, porqué terminará
Porque sólo somos gotas de aire
Hay algo en el mundo, hay algo en el mundo

Hay algo en el mundo
Es esa lógica intacta
En la que nadie sabe nada
Hay algo en el mundo 
Y yo lo voy a encontrar
Es un capricho que me sienta bien
Los años pasaron
Vos y yo sabemos que hay algo ahí
Hay algo en tu mundo, hay algo en mi mundo

Un poco de tristeza não tem fim
Un poco de felicidade sim
Y mucho de belleza inútil para mi para mi pasión
Los motores no apagan, las luces están bien
Y aunque se que vienen muchas tormentas

Lleva, lleva y brinda a mi salud
Lleva, lleva, llévame amor
Lleva, las manzanas y el pastel

Y te des cuenta que los tuyos no son tuyos, no?
De quien?
Y esto se sabe, buena suerte compañero

Y llevá transmisor

Vengo de un lugar donde te volvés canalla

Fito Páez,"Iba duro pero armado hasta los dientes por la vida 
Y no había otra, lo tenia que hacer 
Iba solo a puente alsina y veía policías en los bares 
Y en la calle también 
Le llevaba a los tangueros 15 mogras del abuelo 
Que era el capo de la calle tomás de anchorena
La del chofi, de la mala, de la buena
Toman todos perinola mortal 
Paranoica fierita te cargabas una cantidad
Se encontró con los tangueros, unas perras, un tumbero
Dos modernos que fumaban mucho crack, y un pirómano bombero
Todo en un pequeño agujero que decía le gustaba incendiar 
Pero que era tan, tan bueno que siempre apagaba 
El fuego que tenía la ilusión de crear 
Un planeta imaginario para amar y hacer el daño 
Donde no esté prohibido desear 
Buenos aires igualito que en los tiempos de roberto arlt 

El sabía que guardaban la mandanga en una media
En la viola, en el ropero o en el sucio bandoneón 
Los tangueros eran viejos muy dementes, muy despiertos 
Si podían no pagar, les resultaba mejor 
Y nunca tomaban mucho, les vendían a los giles 
Para que se den coraje, fuerza, coraje y valor 
Paranoica fierita: miserables mercachifles
Esto ya parece un chiste 
O me pagan o les hundo uno a uno el cañón

Narrador: se llevó toda la merca, al tumbero lo hizo socio 
Y el abuelo así un buen día lo recompensó
Le dió flores, caballito hasta el parque rivadavia
Le dió un super porcentaje y una gran comisión
Que no hiciera mucho ruido, que no fuera presumido
Guarda con los de la noche, guarda con el rock and roll
Los consejos le sirvieron, fue ganando su respeto 
Y fue clásico y astuto con la tradición 
Y así se cargo al abuelo, se quedó con todo y no desanimó

Paranoica fierita iba armado hasta los dientes
Pero ahora, treinta años después 
Lo eligieron empresario metalúrgico del año
Los muchachos se lo quieren comer
El tumbero ya no es socio, le vigila los negocios 
Y le lleva chicos del comedor popular y solidario por la patria 
Y en el baño les ofrece sueldo alto y pasión 
Le gustaba el rubiecito de ojos verdes 
Paranoica fierita: ese es un bombón 
Narrador: le decían el polaco y por un par de morlacos 
Cocinaba guiso en el comedor
Que no era ningún boludo 
Registró todo en un walkman
Sus gemidos y los de su patrón, las promesas de los viajes
Matrimonio en filipinas, los pedidos de la ropa interior
El tumbero lo sabía, el polaco era su otelo 
Y él su yago para hacerle el favor

Fito Páez,"Esta es la última canción de amor
De este siglo que pasó, pasó
Y yo quiero regalarte hoy

Algo que suene a esa música
Que ya escuchamos mil veces por radio
Y que hablaba de amor

La última canción de amor
De este sueño que pasó, pasó
Me acordé como éramos los dos

Bajo ese cielo estrellado
Divinos, dorados, borrachos perdidos
Hablando de amor

Esta pieza es para tí, clavel
Mi presente para siempre y ves, ya ves, mi bien
Y así vivimos, entregados, condenados

Abrazados, mutilados
Voy a tener cuidado porque todo con los años
Pierde aquella irrealidad

Que ya escuchamos mil veces por radio
Y que hablaba de amor

Fito Páez,"Nací en el '63, con Kennedy a la cabeza
Una melodía en la nariz, creo que el aire estaba raro, mediaba marzo
El mundo me hizo crecer entre zanahoria y carnes
El '69 me encontró viendo a ese hombre en esa luna televisada

Y vino el colegio, y vino Vietnam
Los yanquis juraban amar el napalm
Jobim me dormía en la noche cuando todo era calma

Tocaba folklore, después rock and roll
Y ahí llegó Lennon hablando de amor
¿Qué pasa en la Tierra que el cielo es cada vez más chico?
¿Qué pasa en la Tierra que el cielo es cada vez más chico?

El barrio está igual que ayer
Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de añitos encima

Después empecé a fumar en cada rincón oscuro
Ya corría el '76, no se puede andar solo en
La calle sin un revolver

Y así tuve una mujer en el medio de mis piernas
Como la marea, un día se fue
Como bicicleta andaba el mundo, apresurado

Recuerdo lugares de mi ciudad
Recuerdo aquel beso en el medio del cine
Recuerdo al guardián en la plaza con su palo de escoba

Hoy mataron a un hombre de pie en Nueva York
Comienza otra década a todo motor
El viento me toca la cara, marca un cambio de rumbo
El viento me toca la cara, marca un cambio de rumbo

El barrio está igual que ayer
Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de añitos encima

Y así empecé el '83, son casi 20 años de historia
El siglo se muere y no cambia más
Está agonizando en cualquier hospital

Nosotros tenemos la culpa y hay que solucionarlo
Llamemos al débil y al orador, al mozo, al poeta
Al músico, al peón
Llamemos a todos los hombres, que el banquete está listo

",Del 63

Cada vez que estamos bien
Cada vez que lo encontramos

Cada vez que te lo pido
Cada vez que vos llamás

Cada foto de mamá
Cada síntoma en el cuerpo
Cada golpe de verdad

Cada vez estoy más lejos

Y siempre nos quedamos solos
Y voy a salir a buscar
Y voy a salir a pegar

Vueltas y vueltas y vueltas en el aire
Van quedando pocos trapos
No me importan cuantos van

Ya no se ni donde vivo
Ya no sé donde parar

Empecé a moverme un poco

Ya lo voy a transpirar

Que se queden ahí atrás
Que se queden con su mundo

Fito Páez,"Nací en el 63, con kennedy a la cabeza
Una melodía en la nariz
Creo que hasta el aire estaba raro
Mediaba marzo
El mundo me hizo crecer
Entre zanahoria y carnes
El 69 me encontró viendo a ese hombre
En esa luna televisada

Y vino el colegio, y vino vietnam
Los yanquis juraban amar el napalm
Jobim me dormía en la noche
Cuando todo era calma
Tocaba folclore y después rock & roll
Y ahí llegó lennon hablando de amor
¿qué pasa en la tierra que el cielo
Cada vez es más chico?
El barrio está igual que ayer

Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de años encima
Después empecé a fumar
En cada rincón oscuro
Ya corría el 76, no se puede andar
Solo en la calle, sin un revólver
Y así tuve una mujer
En el medio de mis piernas

Como la marea, un día se fue
Como bicicleta andaba el mundo
Apresurado
Recuerdo lugares de mi ciudad
Recuerdo aquel beso en el medio del cine
Recuerdo al guardián de la plaza
Con su palo de escoba
Hoy mataron a un hombre de pie
En nueva york

Comienza otra década a todo motor
El viento me toca la cara
Marca un cambio de rumbo
El barrio está igual que ayer
Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de guerras encima
Y así empecé el 83

Son casi 20 años de historia
El siglo muere y no cambia más
Está agonizando en cualquier hospital
Nosotros tenemos la culpa
Y hay que solucionarlo
Llamemos al débil y al orador
Al mozo, al poeta, al músico, al peón
Llamemos a todos los hombres
Que el banquete está listo",Del Sesenta y Tres

Mi primer día sin ti
Que aún digo nosotros
Cuando estoy pensando en ti

Cuando terminó el verano
Todo parecía bien
Ahora pienso en todo eso
Que hablamos sin saber

Sin ninguna explicación
Quizás te parezca fácil
Que soporte este dolor

En tu rápido partir
Y ahora son como tesoros

Fito Páez,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Llueve Sobre Mojado [Bogota 06/08/2003]

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Y una luz sentimental
Nos envuelve, vuelve, se va
La fabulosa sinfonía universal
Nos envuelve, vuelve, se va
Tango, sexo, sexo y amor
Tanto tango, tanto dolor
Mi vida gira en contradicción
Jamás conquisté mi corazón
Mas dónde estaba cuando pasó lo que pasó
Hablándome al espejo solo?
Vengo de un barrio 
Tan mezquino y criminal
Quizá te queme, queme, quizá
Vengo de un barrio 

Siempre a punto de estallar
Quizá te queme, queme, quizá
Si de nada sirve vivir
Buscás algo por qué morir
El tiempo me ha enseñado a mirar
A veces me ha enseñado a callar
Dónde estabas cuando pasó lo que pasó
Hablándote al espejo sola?
Es tanta la tristeza y es tan ruin
Que celebro la experiencia feliz
La estupidez del mundo 
Nunca pudo y nunca podrá
Arrebatar la sensualidad
Busco mi piedra filosofal
En los 7 locos

En el mar
En el cadáver exquisito
En no tener piedad
En la quinta esencia de la música
Dentro mío en el amor
Y el
Odio tener que pensar

Con lo que pude, alegría, buena leche y rock and roll

Fito Páez,"Las piquetas de los gallos 
Cavan buscando la aurora 
Cuando por el monte oscuro baja soledad montolla 
Come amarilla su carne huele a caballo y a sombra 
Y un queso ahumado a sus pechos gimen canciones redondas 
Soledad por quien preguntas sin compañía y a estas horas 
Pregunte por quien pregunte dime a ti que se te importa 
Vengo a buscar lo que busco 
Mi alegría y mi persona 
Soledad de mis pesares caballo que se desboca 
Al fin encuentra la mar y se lo tragan las olas 
No me recuerdes el mar que la pena negra brota 
En las tierras de aceituna 
Bajo el rumor de las hojas 
Soledad que pena tienes que pena tan lastimosa 

Llora sumo de limón agrio de espera y de boca 
Que pena tan grande corro a mi casa como una loca 
Mis dos trenzas por el suelo de la cocina a la alcoba 
Que pena me estoy poniendo de azabache carne y ropa 
Hay mis camisas de hilo 
Hay mi muslos de amapola 
Soledad lava tu cuerpo con agua de las alondras 
Y deja tu corazón en paz soledad 
Y deja tu corazón en paz soledad montolla 
Soledad montolla 

Por abajo canta el rió volante de cielo y hojas

Yo estaba muy pirado y vos eras tan pura
También solías ser mi muchachita punk
Pero en cualquier caso sabías amar

Recuerdo la mañana yendo al hospital
Reías como loca ibas a ser mamá
Hiciste yoga sola encerrada en el baño
Después te di la mano y pasaron los años

La vida es la reina madre de la inmensidad
La que agita las fieras, la que acerca los corazones
La música es la reina madre y ya no se hable más
Silencio que ha llegado ella con sus balas y flores

La sangre juega fuerte, no sabe pensar
Desata las tormentas, desde el más allá
Por suerte nunca me tomé nada tan en serio
Yo sé que ya está todo escrito en el viento

Y todo lo que hacés por obligación
Se lleva la alegría de tu corazón
Y quién se va a creer lo que cuentan los diarios
Yo creo en el amor a través de los años

Yo sólo sé que nunca estuve a la altura
Yo me hago el inocente y vos te hacés la dura
Igual está el amor, no se puede parar

Lo importante es amar
Tan inmenso es el abismo
Lo importante es desear
Y no ser un muerto vivo

Cabalgue solo en la oscuridad
De las crinas de un caballo malo
Te di amor hasta el fondo del bar
Y llore entre las flores de mayo

Solo una oportunidad
Solo hay un solo tiro
Yo nací en esa ciudad
De allí también son mis hijos

Y eso que espera salir
Y eso que esperas en tu corazón

Con aceros reforzó la casa

No dejo entrar a nadie

Y el amor que construimos

Y eso que espera salir
Y eso que salira en tu corazón
Confiadamente hará feliz

Que te cuenta el mundo no hace más que respirar 
Es posible que tus ojos ya no emitan esa luz que 
Enceguecía hace algún tiempo atrás 
Ya se fueron todos de la casa y la mañana envuelve todo, todo
Es un profundo azul 
La verdad se enciende sola, es una flor en el silencio 
Que quema de luz la habitación 
Yo quisiera hablar pero lo que doy es un hombre 
Viendo al norte solo y loco hacia el sur
Tengo que confiar, saber esperar, tengo que respirar
Es un panic attack y sacarme de una vez esta cruz 
La vida son los círculos, los círculos dan vuelta y los círculos se van 
Cuando yo creí que estaba todo bien en realidad 
Estaba haciendo todo exactamente mal 
No es tan grave en verdad las cosas van 
Moviéndose y se mueven a la larga porque sí 
Y si hoy ese perfume es el de la soledad
Si no confiás no vas a ser feliz 
Y me haces hablar 
A veces es mejor quedarse quieto con el 
Trago en la mano en un rincón 

Ya nos veremos en algún lugar, en alguna fiesta
En cualquier ciudad, cuando me hables con el corazón 
Es tu vida, no se puede tocar, es una caja preciosa no se puede tocar
Tendrías que saber quién soy 
Oh, confiá nena confiá, soy todo lo que 
Quieras, también tu suplicio y tu luz

No te vendría mal saber que yo no quiero

Oh, tell my heart, decímelo, contámelo
Probame que lo hiciste mal, es una posibilidad oh 
Y todo lo que no contás es todo lo que alguna 
Vez con toda mi alma voy a confiar

Lo que viene al final 

Yo quiero amarte 
Toda la vida 
El mundo es un fierro caliente 
Y de esto todo amor 
De los laberintos 
Se sale solo por arriba 
Vayamos por ahi a la deriva 
Y no leamos las noticias 
Que traen los diarios del mundo de hoy

Hace calor
En el mundo de hoy

No me importa la verdad 
Un dia mas siempre es mejor

Que rabioso que esta el sol

Fito Páez,"Es que madre aún no habló con abuela 
Y sus hermanos ya no saben qué hacer 
Su papá lo llevó a la escuela 
Y ya nunca lo volvieron a ver 

Cartucho no se hizo mucho problema 
Se fue a la puta con silvita, su amor 
No le dijeron nada a nadie 
Y se fueron a niteroi

El viaje fue divino por las rutas argentinas 
Durmieron en la calle, en las shells y en un camión 
Tomaron colectivos y en clorinda 
Cruzaron el río con dos malandras 
Tomaron cerveza e hicieron el amor 

Así fueron pasando los días 
Y yo sé bien 
Que jamás pensaron en volver atrás 

Escribamos un mensaje o llamemos a tu hermana 
Ella lo sabrá entender, es una piba legal 
Querían ver a la nave espacial de niemayer 
Que vieron el domingo en la revista de clarín 
La noche que llegaron a ipanema se tiraron a dormir 

Entonces pasó lo que pasó

El mar se puso bravo 
Levantaron olas de 1200 metros 
Y así fue que río de janeiro desapareció",La Nave Espacial
Fito Páez,"Un japones me persiguió 
Desde otro otro auto 
Desde la habana y varadero 
Tantas veces me fotografió 
Estaba saliendo el sol 

Y yo pensaba solo en vos 
En la cuchita y en los perros 
En tu perfume de limón 
Tus pelis, tu habitación 

Hoy ya estoy ya estoy afuera 
Y no me puedo quejar 
Tantos viajes tantas ciudades 
Nena no te ofendas es que ale llamo 
Estoy llegando un poco tarde

Mozart no me hace bien 
Me hace sentir un vago 
Es buena la ocasión para seguir de largo

Y sigue ciego mi corazon sigue viajando andando 
Por los destinos del amor viaja mi corazon 
Playboy no me gusta venus es un lugar 
Al final nadie te hace nada 
Demonos un beso es la mejor sensación
Y ahora yo te espero en casa 

Mozart no me hace bien 
Me hace sentir un vago 
Es buena la ocasión para tomarse un trago 

Algo invisible me exigió 
Que no tirara palabras al viento

Estaba saliendo el sol y en Medellin también 
Estaba saliendo el sol 
Estaba saliendo

Fito Páez,"Cuando niño preguntaba 
Si el río llegaría algún día al mar 
Una voz que andaba por ahí 
Me dijo: “tiempo al tiempo”

La verdad es que ya aprendí a esperar 
Que se escriba sola la canción 
Cada cosa en su justo lugar 
Dale tiempo al tiempo

Nace una flor un día 
Y a la misma hora muere un amor 
Es dura la caída 
Pero qué alegría cuando hacemos el gol

Cada día es una oportunidad 
De salir a la calle y enfrentar al viento 
Los sueños a veces se hacen realidad 
Dale tiempo al tiempo

Pensaba en los decadentes 
Cuántas noches en la ruta 
Hoy siguen juntos, qué bueno que está 
Dale tiempo al tiempo 

A las ruinas del amor 
El cadáver de tu enemigo 
Te acerca la distancia 
Entonces, estás vivo 

Cuidado con lo que quieres 
Porque algún día lo podés conseguir 
No se trata sólo de tu voluntad 
Dale tiempo al tiempo 

Todos los días sale el sol 
Y la luna vuelve a brillar 
Ni siquiera una bomba lo puede parar 
Dale tiempo al tiempo
Tiempo al tiempo 

Espero que los tuyos estén bien 
Y vivas con felicidad 
Lo que te queda en este mundo 
Nadie sabe más allá

Dale tiempo al tiempo",Tiempo Al Tiempo

Five Boroughs,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

So many things unanswered
Like what did I do?
What could I do?
Was there ever a moment you cared?

You wished me dead
How could I have changed to make it better?
And would I?
Would I?
Why?

Seems like you were just waiting for me to fail

Five for Fighting,"I sing above my vision. 
I sing above my face.
A fat old amphibian speaker for the dead.
Gather round ye animals. 
Gather round this lake.
Take upon your vigil. Wallow in the wake. 

It was glorious of glories-a maple April day
With a pocket full of horseflies and eyes as bright as rays
They said walk away walk away if you can
but one leap out the village and our caravan began 

Traveled to a forest, nestled in the sky.
He ran beside the buffalo-wrestled with the lions
Every day a saturday, a summer waking morn,
His skin burned golden ember due the shine that toad had born. 

While riding back an eagle, laughing with the sun
He spied an old hairy fairy man upon the river Young.
And Sol said, fly away fly away if you can
But he settled next the oarsman, said I'm my own man and this is my life... 

Heed above my meter, Heed above my fate. 
Can't go back again...
I got a reason to be fevered-summer waking morn.
Back back when the poor poor boy was born. 

Now cross into his fortune. 
While enchanted by the queen.
A lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean.
And in the time it takes a pillow to figure out a face.
Out from in the white tree she rose to take its place. 

And the battle for his spirit then caused him to remain.
And he fought as a thousand Visigoths and he cursed the night in vain.
She said run away run away if you can
But last he heard a voice of...I'm my own man and this is my life... 

Off to in her castle, laid upon the stairs
She showered him with daffodils and tied ribbons in his hair.
He woke for bare a moment but she wouldn't let him weep.
With lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep. 

So royal loyal subjects now let your ears unbend.
For here ye this traveled tail must sadly meet it's end.
What's fate done to our hero I cannot reply...
The last that I saw him, a flection in her eye.",2 Frogs

I'm forty five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life

Fifteen there's still time for you
Time to buy, Time to lose yourself
Within a morning star

Fifteen I'm all right with you
Fifteen, there's never a wish better than this
When I only have a hundred years to live

Half time goes by
Suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye
Sixty seven is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on

I'm 99 for a moment
Dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

Fifteen there's still time for you
Twenty two I feel her too
Thirty three you're on your way
Every day's a new day

Fifteen there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose

Till she showed me what a fire was 

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son 
I could be a dividend if you're my only one 

So I bought 12,000 acres

I caught a glimpse inside the universe there 
I couldn't handle the dimensions

Nothing can be better than baring yourself for another
Open for scrutiny, ridicule, and indulgence
Therein lies the balls, and the mind, and the heart
As fear is truly the mind killer
When nothing is left
Everything is gained

In a land that was forgotten
She brought a candle to my mind
But it got no easier then
So I snuck out of her apartment
I went down to buy a premium
But all that settled was my mind, for a time
Till she showed me what a fire was

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son
I could be a dividend if you're my only one

So I bought 12,000 acres
Suddenly it was a dozen
And for a moment I was blind but for the time 
I caught a glimpse inside the universe there
I couldn't handle the dimensions
See 2+2 can = 5 here
So I sold off unto a lamb, but it was a scam
And he giggled like he'd won the lottery

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son
I could be a dividend if you're my only one

And all the children started singing
There I fell into a coffin
Brought the water in my eyes
I wondered at the miracle there

When it all was finally over
I thought about our time here
Here where everything's divine

Five for Fighting,"Early one morning at county line
The swells 4-6 approaching 9
The barrel of my life hit the Malibu sky
A golden state pipe, Conchita was mine

Suddenly a local on a boogie in a thong
Cut in on my line, my barrel was gone
Her Pepperdine stud screamed, ""val that's what you get""
I shot him with a gun behind Neptune's net.

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Took off in the mustang for the 395
Double double in Mohave, took a left at lone pine
I powered up the top of mt. Whitney
They may not have a jamba juice but here they'll never get me

While working my tan looked down the cliff to see
A line of black and whites dropped by a yellow jersey
Called uncle Arnie said, ""what's going on""
He said, ""new sheriff in town, name's lance Armstrong""

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Hired a fixer to keep things blurry
Sent the shuttle to space for the perfect jury
The judge dropped the bar and to the court decreed
You can lay down all you like
Tell me what you see

I'm free
Heading up the Truckee River
To catch me a brown though the water makes me shiver
Mistake I made was crossing the border
Casinos for me are cooked and made to order

I didn't intend to kill the dealer last night
But I doubled down to 20, his 16 pulled a 5
Now I'm heading back to Cali bound for Tahoe City

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Moral of the story keep the straight and narrow
Your eyes on the ball
Your hands off the sparrow
Every country needs one broken arrow
At least we gave you Ronnie Reagan,
Sonny and Chero

I'll meet you down behind Neptune's net
Catch my honey in the thong
Do you get it yet?
We'll catch barrels every day
I'm just surfing the u.s.a.

One evening out on the road,

I don't know why, I just do.
When are you coming home?""
""I'm coming home soon.

Her head on my heart.

Did you write her letters
Did it make you better face the great unknown

We'll get together one of these days

How can you be as nice as me
You're not from the same slice as me
Where do we go from here my friend
Is this the way our story ends

Hey man sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a slice
Of American Pie

Can't stop singin' along
Can you join in, come on
Are we more than just a slice
Of American pie

We're top down lovers, it's Saturday night
The band's roarin' and it feels so right
The moon's dancin' and the stars are free
I caught your heart on a summer's breeze

Whatever was or what's meant to be
Our melodies are memories

There was a time a long long time ago
Chevy's and Levi's played on the radio
No cell phones just twenty thousand lights
Swayin' on a Saturday night alright

Hey man sing me a song

And Jane says, I'm your body in the night
And I'll lead you where you might find yourself
Better if you follow me

So go right you'll be left at a big hotel
You'll meet the devil at the bottom of a wishing well
You know you better give him something
Give him something good

But I'm gonna make it out

I wrote the secret that I buried on the wishing well wall
He said, I've seen one it follows that I've seen them all

We spoke of human destination in a perfect world
Derived the nature of the universe found it unfulfilled
As I took him in my arms he screamed, I'm not insane
I'm just looking for someone to understand my pain

You can't live in a castle far away

There have been mysteries from the beginning of time
There are answers we're not wise enough to see

Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Five in Orbit,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Five Iron Frenzy,"When I was young, the smallest trick of light, 
Could catch my eye, 
Then life was new and every new day, 
I thought that I could fly. 
I believed in what I hoped for, 
And I hoped in things unseen, 
I had wings and dreams could soar, 
I just don't feel like flying anymore. 
When the stars threw down their spears, 
Watered Heaven with their tears, 
Before words were spoken, 
Before eternity. 

Dear Father, I need you, 
Your strength my heart to mend. 
I want to fly higher, 
Every new day again. 

When I was small, the furthest I could reach, 
Was not so high, 
Then I thought the world was so much smaller, 
Feeling I could fly. 
Through distant deeps and skies, 
Behind infinity, 
Below the face of Heaven, 
He stoops to create me. 

Dear Father, I need you, 
Your strength my heart to mend. 
I want to fly higher, 
Every new day again. 

Man versus himself. 
Man versus machine. 
Man versus the world. 
Mankind versus me. 
The struggles go on, 
The wisdom I lack, 
The burdens keep piling 
Up on my back. 
So hard to breathe, 
To take the next step. 
The mountain is high, 
I wait in the depths. 
Yearning for grace, 
And hoping for peace. 
Dear God... 
Increase. 
Healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again. 
Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever. 
Freedom means love without condition,
Without a beginning or an end. 
Here's my heart, let it be forever Your's, 
Only You can make every new day seem so new.

To sing their anthem proudly
Voices raised to sing their praise
Of their hollow country

And some talk of liberty
From your plastic podium

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

I can't see red, white, and blue waving in the air
I don't hear the bombs bursting and I don't even care
I'm sorry for my lack of faith
I'm not the greatest patriot
If this is all their is to freedom I don't want it

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

Pushing us a drug that you call freedom and democracy
Promise us that selfishness is the means for happiness
I burned that bridge so long ago that I can hardly see
Anything but solace in what freedom means to me

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

It cannot mean to serve ourselves
That doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't mean to give the license
To seek ourselves in anything
That would be slavery to ourselves it isn't free

When you feel that you can't go on
You gotta give it what you got
Even though its not a lot
Never think that your the only one
well well well
Sometimes
When you know there's a better day
You gotta pick yourself up
With a little bit of luck
You can chase the blues away
well well well

When the world is on your shoulders
Don't let it get you down
You gotta pull yourself together
Coz your time will come around

But your running out of time
And you can't expect a miracle
Look and you will find
That everything is beautiful

Te vas hasta Laredo 
Y quieres mas y mas

Ya me voy para nunca mas volver 
Me dejastes sin dinero y sin rolante 
Por el mundo te me echastes a correr

Flaco Jiménez,"There's a place, so I've been told,
Every street is paved with gold
And it's just across the borderline
And when it's time to take your turn
There's a lesson that you must learn
You may lose more than you'll ever hope to find.

And when you reach that broken promised land
And all your dreams slip though your hand
You have learned it's too late to change your mind
Cause you pay the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline.

Up and down the rio grande
A thousand foot prints in the sand
Reveal a secret no one can define
The river rolls on like a breath
In between our life and death
Tell me who is next to cross that borderline.

And when you reach that broken promised land
And all your dreams slip though your hand
You'll know it's too late to change your mind
Cause you pay the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline.",Across the Borderline

And I'm all strung out on heroin

Hadn't known her for too long when I had to let her go
You see, she had a razor, was ten inches or so
And every night you'd hear her knocking at my door
She said, Baby, I'll give you the clothes on my back
You can have everything that I've got in my shack
But if you ever try to leave they'll take your out in sack
Cause me and my razor will see to that""

I told him, ""Skip it, we had that understanding right from the start""

Well, we settled down, got me a little old job, 65 Fairlane Ford
Every Friday night I would stop in and cash my pay check down at the grocery store
They had a little girl worked in there, must have been about seventeen
She was the cutest thing I had ever seen
It's the same old story and I'm afraid it wasn't too very long
Before we had fallen deeply in love and I knew it was wrong
I said baby, we got to stop this thing right here
Or my woman is gonna cut my throat from ear to ear, that's right
Tearful suffocation, she looked up in my face
I could feel her heart was breaking as these sad words she did say
""You should have told me you was married, baby""
She pulled out a forty-five and let me have it, right smack between the eyes
That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas

Flaco Jiménez,"When you're ready for steady to go dancin', romancin'
Grab your sweetheart and jump in your car

Drive right on down to the bright side of town
You'll be glad you don't have to drive far
You'll be happy you don't have to go far
Park your pickups and Cadilacs, Fords and Renaults
And dance like the dickens to the West Texas Waltz
Grandmammy, grandpappy if you plan to stay happy
You better lace up your best dancin shoes
          
Come see us, don't write us, you can stop your arthritis
Just by dancin' away your blues
Just by dancin' away your blues
So bind up your bunions with band-aids and gauze
Come dance like the dickens to the West Texas Waltz

I met a fine  banker and I'd sure like to thank him
For the credit he gave me made me shout
                      
He changed my whole attitude and  to show him ny gratitude
I decided I'd just ask him out.
Yes I thought I just might ask her out
I said close up your windows, honey, lock up your vaults
And dance like the dickens to the West Texas Waltz
We spent the next to the last dollar in the old ice cream parlor
On a milkshake and a malt and a pop

Then we heard us some sounds, there was a honky tonk lounge
Right Next  to the ice cream shop
Next door to the ice cream shop
Now only two things are better than milkshakes and malts
And one is dancin' like the dickens to the West Texas Waltz
And the other is somethin', but really it's nothin'
To speak of it's somethin' to do

If you've done it before, you'll be doin' it some more
Just as soon as the dancin' is through
Right after the dancin' is through
And if anybody asks you why, just tell it's because
You been dancin' like the dickens to the West Texas Waltz.

For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son
And Satan tried to knock Him too
But when they knocked the nails in His hands, Colossians 2
And 15, but yet I still see a common theme
That's plaguing adults, and it's plaguing the teens
When Jesus died, He did more than just give us some help
So help me understand why we still living for self
We live for our families, for our money and cars
We live for our happiness, cause our pleasure is lord
But ain't we seen yet, that that just doesn't work
Living for self can only lead to dozens of hurts
Please hear my heart, like a stethoscope
We're taking steps towards death, but looking for hope
Because we were captured by sin
We were seized, now we need to be captured again
That's why we need to pick them Scriptures up
Start praying and fasting, and ask the Father to forgive us of
Forgive us for laziness, forgive us Lord for our pride
Forgive us for worldliness, forgive us, cleanse us inside
Cleanse us Lord from telling lies, cleanse us from our selfishness
Cleanse us from our fear of man, we need more than help from this
We confess our lack of love, We confess selfish ambition
We confess to You our lust, oh Lord bring us to repentance

Picking up a basketball made him feel like there was hope
If he didn't play ball he probably be selling dope

There's so much going on made him feel like he was grown
That he had to go hard in the gym like a champ
And all he thought about was him and his camp
He said fam we go'n make it that's all he had to say?

Or am I just exhausted appetite lost it is my heart cold or is it just frosted
How long is my crave is is my hunger my thirst is
Having a relapse for idol God worship
I know this is dangerous wrong and deceit but it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
I know God is my Father and I am His son
He provides for me I should not jump the gun
Said I know this is dangerous wrong and deceit but it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
Voila
Then I have to tell myself He was tempted to provide for Himself too
Dry desert no food forty days forty nights think His appetite
Wasn't like Eve's or the Israelites or like yours or like mine
Then the serpent came right time right lies
But He chose to be father not fed make the same choice resist the devil's bread

Flame,"I don't want to ruin my life
When I see you homie it just looks like you gave in
I went to prayer start praying for my good friend
I took it there tears falling over your sin
And I ain't one to hurt you but I can't ignore it man
Guess you don't wanna trust the gospels so you caved in
And made excuses for your own sin
You ain't cutting off no limbs plucking no eyes or cutting no hands
When temptation starts popping like it's pay per view
You just stand there take a few to the face and you
Don't understand Satan's baiting you
And his whole plan is erasing you
You don't wanna be father you wanna be fed
Til you vomit up Satan's bread
You forgetting that you are son and that God is provider
I guess you jumped the gun again",Devil's Bread (Intro)
Flame,"The great deception, ception, ception, ception, ception
Ception, ception, ception, ception

See the king and the queen, they were under bosses
Ruling everything, their dominion was exhausted
(Now let every creeping thing) except for God himself
And each other, but they represented God himself

In his image of perfection, joy, bliss, it was paradise
But I can hear the ploy, the hiss (no more being nice)
Of the serpent who slithers in the grass
And calls into question, the giver of the task (are you sure)
I know they brew over me (I'm the beast of the field)
But how can I persuade them (gotta get us out their minds)
Make 'em think that they are animals (make 'em think they are the king)
Then I can degrade them (then I got 'em, I got 'em)
This is my plot, but I'll have to use their appetites to twit them in a knot
(Tell 'em they can be like God) Then maybe I can win
If I could use Adam's appetite to make him sin

[Chorus]
I never saw me stumbling, I never thought I'd fall
The day that You created me, I know You gave Your all
You put so much of You in me
I almost lost it all
The great deception (ception, ception, ception)

Look at the queen of the universe, walking in the garden
The image bearing empress, conversing with the fallen
(Serpent who was crawling) the evil spirit of Eden
Who tried to redefine the definition of freedom
Ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, just eat the fruit from the tree
You are a goddess, you are deity
You are much more than God has revealed
Go ahead Eve exercise your reveal
Distinguish for yourself, good and evil
But who am I, I'm just a beast of the field
No the fruit is not lethal, just eat see how it makes you feel
And how it makes you think, and how it makes you act
Fact! Your God has been holding back
Scratch that, He is flat out lie
If you eat from the tree you will not surely die

[Chorus]

From the dawn of history, the mystery of lawlessness
Hijack the cosmic order, interrupted flawlessness
Introduce fallenness and now the servant-king
Who used to rule the land forfeited everything
And now the image bearers, Adam and Eve
Gave up their authority and were forced to leave
The sanctuary of Eden, The world was the kingdom
But Adam brought the curse
Because of his disobedience
Now demonic powers, rule the universe
Satan is the leader, and death is the curse
The Father sent Jesus, to come press reverse
But he had to hit the wilderness first
To overcome temptation, overcome sin
These are the things that are common to man
And that's exactly what he did, after the resurrection
The safest place to be is in Him for protection
For perfection
For correction
To escape the great deception

Overcome temptation
Overcome sin
Overcome temptation
Overcome sin (over-overcome sin)

After the resurrection
The safest place to be is in Him for protection (for protection)
For perfection (for perfection)
For correction (for correction)

Although it was crossin’ my mind
I’m glad he saved me though
No tellin’ where I would be
If I’d be dead or alive
But there is no goodness in me
And the truth I was chasin’ my sin
And got to be desperate to take this on
Try to be left and this could be your song
They sold me by factor on decrease alone
It was His own sovereign choice
That He would snatch me up out of the grave
Took me up, turned me around, now I am saved

But if you a Christian then let the world know
That they can be free and be cool without that
But not only free, that they can be whole

That they can return and find a purpose
Take a return and finally know

You could’ve past me by and let me dead in my seat

Flame,"I can hear your questions homie is that book reliable?
Yes it is the testaments are very verifiable
What do you believe in? What do you abide by?
Maybe it's a mixture of different stuff tie-dye
You boys are all syncretists sinking in your own thoughts
The book that I hold to cohesive and never off
Say my book carrying lies but it's quite the contrary
66 holy scripts it's more like a library
Written by about forty authors in three different languages
English is not one of them Greek and Hebrew surely is
Inspired and inerrant woah what does that mean?
It's from God and without err in absolutely everything
Ya it addresses class in session boy I hope you learn something
Hear them lies from other guys boy I hope you turn from em
Why does it matter though? If the Bible's false or true
Matter of fact for your answer that let me caution you
Don't play with epistemology homie we need absolutes
If there's no such thing as truth then he can do what he want to do
She can do what she want to do and can't nobody say nothing
If a killer pull them choppers out and feel like spraying something
Ain't nobody say it's wrong and we all know that's a lie
Somebody outside of us has to speak and rectify
That's just what God did in the Christian holy book
Why don't you crack it open sit down take a look

God has communicated with us man
The Bible is the most thoroughly documented work of all antiquity
If we can't trust in the Bible we can't trust nothing

Let's go
Why they give my book a hard time? Especially the new testament?
Bi-textural barriers that's utterly irrelevant
To the proper understanding and translation of the text
Yes with more manuscripts there are more variants
But the more the merrier homie this is not a threat
This is strong evidence we posses the original text
Having these manuscripts different areas different times
Yet they all testify to the same text just blows my mind
God is so
Ain't no words to explain
How He preserve His word through desert plains and heavy rains
But they trying to tell us that the Bible's been corrected
I say they are misinformed and they might as well cut it
See flame is bout to get deep and I ain't talking scuba gear
I'm talking real scholarly bought to bring some proof in here
P 75 codex vaticanus
These are two manuscripts from scriptures in the canon
And when I say canon I ain't talking bout he
But the collection of books that will function as the rule
Back to p 75 it's from the second century
The other's from the fourth sorry bout the history
150 years these copies are separated
But it's so fascinating how they are so closely related

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me

Las horas perdidas. 
Como un eclipse de sol 
Dos astros luchan por ser 
Los dueños del día 
Y de las sombras también 
 
En un combate de amor 
Se roban luz sin saber 
Que agotan su fuerza 
En un eclipse de sol. 
Después llego la hora 
De comprender que no hay misterios, 
Que esperar sólo silencio y miradas lejanas
No, no, no hay más revancha 
Que intentar hacernos polvo, 
Desdibujados en cielos distintos",Eclipse de Sol
Flans,"Hay cosas que puedo contar 
Del mundo donde estoy 
Mis palabras enloquecen cuando puedo tocar 
Azules, verdes, rojos y los demás 
Que me envuelven al mirar 
Los retengo y va todo bien 
Va todo bien 

Me pierdo en cálidos sonidos 
Del aire al pasar 
Y dan mil vueltas en mi espacio 
Me empujan a bailar y siento que son algo mío 
Me provocan respirar 
Los retengo y va todo bien 
Va todo bien 

Gracias 
Por ser capaz de darme el todo y el más 
Sólo gracias 
Por ser solo el inicio y nunca el final. 

De repente llegas tú 
Rodeado de color 
Tu presencia es tan real 
Que agitas mi verdad 
Hasta ahora es que entiendo 
La luz viene de tí, y me sorprendo. 

Gracias 
Por ser capaz de darme el todo y el más

It's been a hell of an evening and I've had a good time
And now that it's over, well let's get it straight
Don't think that I'm stupid, that I took the bait
I know you're in trouble and you're on the mat
So before you get busy, well here's where it's at

[Chorus]
Where were you when I needed you
Where were you at the fall
Where were you when the light went out
You were nowhere at all

Danny's a junkie and Susie's on bail
And Jimmy's still there in that Mexican jail
And while you've been sitting with your face in your food
Lucy's out there in that Norwegian wood
You think you've got troubles, well what do you know
And as for the favour you know where to go

[Chorus]

You were the hero, you were the best
I was the fool that got left with the mess
And while you were living it up on the coast
Yours truly was stuck here with a room full of ghosts
So hear what I tell you, you miserable clown
We're all gonna help you, on your way down

Flash Cadillac,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain",Crying in the Rain

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

Bought a thousand dollar van
Picked the boys up on the west side

Get a 40 and some gum

A little gloss to keep me warm

Hey there pepsi did you see?

Steady breakin' me on down, break break down,

Break break down, steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down.

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus]
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But never the less

It's over, it's ending here (here)

I remember the boys who took a stand,
Who stood there strong when things got rough,
They would shout and scream at the things that were tough,
No weapon formed against them would live,
A punch to the face, a kick to the rib
Their cause was justice and they strove to be pure,
All of hell shook when their knees hit the floor,

Never look back never give up,
There's someone behind who will pick you up,
I got a sword in my hand and I'm ready for the attack.

And in my dreams I walk alone

I'll just pretend that I don't love you
I'll just pretend that I don't care

I'll turn my head, I'll just pretend

Those happy hours we spent together
Forever in my heart will live
That's all I have for each tomorrow
For we will never meet again

I'll just pretend that I don't love you

And when I meet you face to face, dear

Flatt & Scruggs,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word

Flavor,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Believe and one day you'll do just as well now
As you were you little puppet you pauper you
Freak that's right
That's what some of them have said to me

So I object and try to figure things out for myself
I'm building up full emotional wealth

Us not to feel
It's time that we helped there's no room to fail
You already know the way out of hell

All we got is ourselves I have faith in that

We started following a certain description,
We started simple and fair once again
Before there wasn't any need for an answer
things were much different then

But now you question who I am, who I am inside
Now there nothing left to hide, so here it goes this is my letter

Hope you're alright, it's been rough for me 
Thinking all night about the places I'd be
If I maybe just did a little bit more you might've let me become a man for sure
And if I might, express one concern it seems an issue, all day at every turn
What's the next step, the latest hole in my life
What's next for me to learn

Engulf myself into a permanent mystery, no one day just as the next, not for me
It's so confusing when I look at my history, 
I just can't handle that yet....no

When they had their daughter

Could I wash my hands of

Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me

In dearth or in excess
Both the slave and the empress
Will return to the dirt I guess, naked as when they came

I wonder if I'll see any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling
Nobody else to blame

Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me
Oh man that I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me

And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

Are the worst of all

I want to shelter you

There’s nowhere we can hide

Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

Carved out his initials in the bark

Then the Earth shook, that was all that it took for the dream to break
All the loose ends would surround me again in the shape of your face

What makes me love you despite the reservations?
What do I see in your eyes
Besides my reflection hanging high?

Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue, the useless sirens scream

The song of masses, passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire, blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I, out into the night
Held within the line that they've drawn

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Oh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son, and a daughter
Oh, are we also tamed?

I walked home, no words to say
Cassius, one month gone on his way
And who will lead us and who remains to die?
By a thread, drop my head to cry

Fleet Foxes,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

So unseen, as light in a dream

Fleet Foxes,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
