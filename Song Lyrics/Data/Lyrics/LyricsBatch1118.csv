Ricky Martin,"Se que estas prohibida
Que hay alguien en tu vida
Pero déjame 
Amarte una vez más 

No es una aventura
Se trata de una duda
El saber si tu
Sigues siendo tu
Si aun te puedo rescatar 

Lo que nos pase pasara
Lo que venga ya vendrá
Pero déjame intentarlo
Una ves más 

No es que me quiera enamorar
Solamente comprobar
Si el pasado se ha pasado
O volverá 

Se que es peligroso
Que ya no estamos solos
No te he sido fiel
Pero sigues en mi piel 

Vuelves a mi mente
Tan constantemente
Que me empieza ya
A preocupar
No poderte superar 

Lo que pase pasara
Lo que venga ya vendrá
Pero déjame intentarlo
Una vez más
No es que me quiera enamorar
Solamente comprobar
Si el pasado se ha pasado
O volverá 

Lo que nos pase pasara
Lo que venga ya vendrá
Pero déjame intentarlo
Una vez más
No es que me quiera enamorar
Solamente recordar
y jugar con el amor
Una vez más 

Lo que nos pase pasara
Lo que venga ya vendrá
Pero déjame intentarlo
Una vez más
No es que me quiera enamorar
Solamente comprobar 
Si el pasado se ha pasado
O volverá
Pero déjame intentarlo","Lo Que Nos Pase, Pasara"
Ricky Martin,"Me amaras
Aunque tenga que rogarte, me amaras
Aunque tenga que obligarte, me amaras
Eres cosa mía 

Me amaras
Aunque tenga que sudarte, me amaras
Aunque tenga que domarte, me amaras
Llegara ese día 

Me amaras
Es un reto que ha nacido entre los dos
Eres la única mujer que se escapo
Al quererla más 

Haré tres anos te deseo
Haré tres anos te respeto
Haré tres anos
Pero ahora no es igual 

Haré tres anos que te admiro
Haré tres anos yo era un crío
Ahora te juro que tu
Me vas a amar 

Me amarás
Aunque tenga que humillarme, me amaras
Aunque tenga que agotarte me, amaras
Eres cosa mía 

Me amaras
Aunque tenga que raptarte, me amaras
O tan solo seducirte porque ya
Ha llegado el día 

Me amaras
Es un reto que ha nacido entre los dos
Eres la única mujer que se me fue
Fuera de control 

Haré tres anos te deseo
Haré tres anos te respeto
Haré tres anos
Pero ahora no es igual 

Haré tres anos que te admiro
Haré tres anos yo era un crío
Ahora te juro que tu
Me vas a amar",Me Amaras
Ricky Martin,"Llegas
Como la tempestad
Vuelan tus ropas
Rompes mi camisa
Vas directa a mi
Casi obsesiva
No disimulas
Que me necesitas 

Luego la danza del amor
El rito eterno
Quejas y caricias
El sudor, tu y yo
y todo gira
Ya no me hablas
Ya no me miras
Pero a mi me llega la calma
y a ti te llega la vida 

No me pidas más
Déjame sonar un ato
No me pidas más
Aunque se que sigues temblando
No me pidas más
Déjame gozar este descanso 

Llegas
Pensando solo en ti
Cuando tu quieras
O me necesitas (O lo necesitas)
Pero sabes que
No puedo amarte así
Estas muy tensa
Vas muy deprisa
Por eso no estamos juntos
Cuando se desborda la vida 

No me pidas más
Déjame sonar un rato
No me pidas más
Aunque se que sigues temblando
Luego volveré
Déjame gozar este descanso
Callados 

No me pidas más
Deja ya de acariciarme
No me pidas más
Sabes bien que voy amarte
Cálmate mujer
Ámame pero ámame despacio 

Amiga, no me pidas más
Déjame sonar un rato
No me pidas más
Aunque se que sigues temblando
Cálmate mujer
Ámame pero ámame despacio",No Me Pidas Mas
Ricky Martin,"No se porque
Estoy cansado del amor
Y es que me siento perdido
Y sin razón

Si vieras como me encuentro
Entenderías mi obsesión 
Se ne agoto la paciencia
Mi vida  más que yo

No puedo más
Yo ya estoy harto 
De jugar a amar

Donde estarás
No se si el amor que busco existirá

No creo en las historias que pase
No entiendo como yo pude
Ser cruel

Todos los días cambiaba
Del compañera por placer
Y ahora que lo recuerdo
Siento vergüenza nada más

No puedo más
Donde estarás
Si vieras como me encuentro
No puedo más
Te quiero nena

No puedo más
Yo ya estoy harto 
De jugar a amar
Donde estarás
No se si el amor que busco existirá",Donde Estaras
Ricky Martin,"Antes de que empiece a amanecer
Y vuelvas a tu vida habitual
Debes comprender que entre los dos
Todo ha sido puro y natural

Tu loca manía
Has sido mía
Solo una vez
Dulce ironía
Fuego de noche, 
nieve de día

Luego te levantas y te vas
El te esta esperando como siempre
Luces tu sonrisa más normal
Blanca, pero fría como nieve

Tu loca manía
Has sido mía
Solo una vez
Dulce ironía
Fuego de noche, nieve de día

Y mientras yo me quedo sin ti
Como un huracán rabioso y febril
Tanta pasión, tanta osadía oh, tu

Fuego de noche, nieve de día

Noche a noche en blanco sin dormir
Ardo entre los pliegues de mi cama
Se que estas a punto de venir
Pero solo viene la mañana

Tu loca manía
Has sido mía
Solo una vez
Dulce ironía
Fuego de noche, nieve de día

Y mientras yo me quedo sin ti
Como un huracán rabioso y febril
Tanta pasión, tanta osadía oh, tu

Fuego de noche, nieve de día","Fuego de Noche, Nieve de Dia"
Ricky Martin,"Después de tanto tiempo que ha pasado
Te parecerá mentira
Pero no me acostumbro
Parece como hubiera sido ayer
Ese primer día que nos vimos desnudos

Y siempre pensé
La vida debe de continuar
Pero sin ti
Todo se quedo por la mitad

A medio vivir
A medio sentir
Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti

Después de tanto tiempo que ha pasado
Aun te espero como siempre
En el mismo sitio
Aun así logro sentir
Tu pecho presionado con el mio
Y tus latidos
Y cada vez
Se me haré más difícil cada vez
Y es que sin ti
Todo se quedo por la mitad

A medio vivir
A medio sentir
Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti

A medio vivir
A medio sentir
Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti

Llevamos mucho tiempo hablando
Y no te seguiré aburriendo más
Con mi discurso
Solo te llamaba por saber
Si por si acaso tu también
Necesitabas
No esta de más
Hablar de vez en cuando
No esta de más

Y es que sin ti
Respiro con un solo pulmón
Y es que sin ti
Todo se quedo por la mitad
A medio vivir, a medio vivir",A Medio Vivir
Ricky Martin,"Es tarde ya
Pero da igual
La noche es fría
Las manos ni las sentía

Quietos los dos
Callándonos
Las horas que pasarían
O puede que fueran días

No hay violines pero estas tu
No hay parolas pero esta tu luz
Estamos congelando el amor
Para conservar lo mejor

No te preocupes porque
Nada es imposible
Si funden los fusibles
Del corazón
Del corazón

Nada es imposible
Podemos hacernos invisibles
Con mi amor
Si somos dos

Nada que ver 
Que torpe proceder
Mi timidez repentina
Mi risa de serpentina

Nada que ver
Un charlatán de ayer
Que diferente sentía
Solo con compañía

No hay atardecer pero me miras tu
No hay brisa de mar y no suspiras tu 
Estamos decorando este rincón
Poniendo a la ciudad en situación

No te preocupes porque

Nada es imposible
Si funden los fusibles
Del corazón
Del corazón
Nada es imposible
Podemos hacernos invisibles
Con mi amor
Si somos dos",Nada Es Imposible
Ricky Martin,"Eh, eh
Voy disparar a tu soledad
Salvar tu corazón
Es una revolución

Fíjate como va mi amor
A tocar tu amor
Para darte la salvación
Es una revolución

Solo quiero desarmarte de una sola vez
Liberarte de la cárcel de tu timidez
Y firmar entre tus brazos tu liberación
Esta noche he ha comenzado la revolución

Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Es una revolución 
Es una revolución 

Eh, eh
Voy a combatir
Contra tu prisión
Salvar tu corazón

Es una revolución 
Fíjate como va mi amor

Es una revolución
Solo quiero desarmarte de una sola vez

Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Es una revolución
Es una revolución",Revolución
Ricky Martin,"Tú y yo locura de amor
Cuando el uno aprende a ser dos
En la pasión
Y a viajar y a sonar y sonar
De corazón
Y ahora se bien donde voy
Donde iré por ti, amor

Somos la semilla
De una nueva vida
Y de cada pena
Haremos una risa
Haremos una risa

Al pensar con el corazón
Tú y yo llevamos razón
Porque el amor
Solo da la verdad, de verdad
Sin condición
Por eso se bien donde voy
Donde iré por ti, amor

Somos la semilla
De una nueva vida
Y de cada pena
Haremos una risa
Haremos una risa

Tu boca en mi boca
Mi piel en tu piel
Bebiendo tu agua con mi sed
Somos la semilla
Tu mano en mi mano
Tu piel en mi piel
Juntando mi aroma con tu miel

De una nueva vida

Ricky Martin,"Solo tú
Solamente tu lo sabrás
Mira lo que siento
Un amor de viento nada más

Yo que te ame
Que jamás te mentí
Me entregue solo a ti
Y te perdí

Volverás, volverás
Seguro que pronto vuelves a mi vida
Y ya nunca me darás besos en 
A mi lado beberás toda mi energía

Solo tu solamente tu lo sabrás
Este es mi secreto
Una carta escrita en el mar
Te desee
Por encima de mi
Y apostándote te jugué
Y te perdí

Volverás, volverás",Volverás
Ricky Martin,"Hoy alce mi voz
Gritando a la ciudad 
Pues nunca me hablo de ti

Pues tu llegaste why me cambiaste
La ansiedad
Con mucho ""love and piece""

Pues me haces reir
Me haces llorar
A las demas discriminar
Es lo que me haces tu

En una cuerda floja caminar
why por ti hasta matar
Es lo que me haces tu

why yo no pense
Que fuera a ser asi
Mi cuerpo adicto a ti 
Es lo que me haces tu
Uy, uy, uy, uy, uy

Ricky Martin,"Qué difícil es decir lo siento
Traicionar un juramento
Un aniversario sin promesas
Sin un solo beso
Profanar la cama en que dormimos
Y la mesa que gozamos
Y beber del vaso que bebimos
Con distintos labios

Es la vida
Qué culpa tengo yo
Qué me lía siempre con una aventura nueva
Qué me deja ciego
Y me aleja con su juego
De tu pobre corazón

Adiós te digo
Y me siento mi peor enemigo
Se desgarra nuestra historia pasada
Por otra historia que se queda en nada

Que difícil es amar de nuevo
Comparar con tu sonrisa
Otras cuatrocientas mil sonrisas
Y entregarme entero
Llegar a querer con tanta prisa
En tan poco tiempo
Y sentir de pronto sentimientos
Sin saber si quiero
Es la vida

Adiós te digo
Y me siento mi peor enemigo
Se desgarra nuestra historia pasada
Por otra historia que se queda en nada
Adiós te digo
Y en ese adiós llevo mi castigo
Yo te quiero y digo que no te quiero
Y mis lagrimas empapan el suelo

Adiós te digo, adiós te digo
Tu
Principio y final
Conmigo quedaras",Asi Es la Vida

Que tristemente suenan por mi
En esta casa sin gente
Que me recuerda tanto, tanto a ti

Para provocar una ola

Que en algún lugar
Yo podría ser alguien

Y también soné
Que si he de triunfar

Tendré que superar

No importa la distancia
El rumbo encontrare 
Y tendré valor

Y sueñame en la luna
Ámame por las calles
Perdidas de mi vida
Bésame poco a poco

Estoy seguro que esta vez
No habrá marcha atrás

Después de todo fui yo a decirte que no
Sabes bien que no es cierto
Estoy muriendo por dentro

Y ahora es que me doy cuenta
Que sin ti no soy nada
He perdido las fuerzas
He perdido las ganas

He intentado encontrarte
En otras personas
No es igual
No es lo mismo
Nos separa un abismo

Vuelve
Que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve
Que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve
Nadie ocupara tu lugar

Sobra tanto espacio
Si no estas
No paso un minuto sin pensar
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

Algo me dice
Ya no sirve de nada
Tantas noches en vela
Aferrado a mi almohada

Si pudiera tan solo regresar un momento
Ahora es que te comprendo
Ahora es cuando te pierdo

Vuelve
Que sin ti la vida se me va

Y a pesar que fui yo
A decirte que no
Sin embargo aquí sigo insistiendo te

Vuelve
Que sin ti la vida se me va",Vuelve

En Rio de Janeiro
Sin hablar, en el bulevar
Esa noche bailamos tango

Extrao su boca carioca, sensual
Que roza al mover los hombros
Extrao su aroma, su piel
No me importa
La sigo hasta el fin del mundo

why bailamos por un callejon
Why bailamos sin parar
Com sus ojos me embrujo
La diosa del carnaval carnaval

Amanecio, no me dijo adios
Mientras yo soaba
Solo me dejo una noche de amor
Why una rosa en su almohada

Busco su voz why su canto gitano
En mi alma dejo una huella
Anhelo el calor de su cuerpo e sus besos
No aguanto vivir sin ella

why bailamos por un callejon
Why bailamos sin parar
Com sus ojos me embrujo

Ricky Martin,"Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you baby can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me

It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Let your private emotion come to me
Come to me

When your soul is tired
And your heart is weak
Do you think of love
As a one way street
Well it runs both ways,
Open up your eyes
Can't you see me here,
How can you deny
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight

Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by
But you can find me here
Till your tears run dry
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight",Private Emotion
Ricky Martin,"I met a girl at the carnival 
In Rio de Janeiro 
We danced all night on the boulevard 
In doorways we did the tango 

I miss her lips 
And the way she sashayed her hips 
As she shook her shoulders 
I miss the smell of her hair 
I don't care if it takes my whole life to find her 

[Chorus]
We were dancing in the summer rain 
We were dancing through the night 
I never knew her name 
So I called her Spanish eyes 
Spanish eyes

The sun came up 
And the girl was gone 
Her masquerade was over 
I searched the streets drunk with love 
But no one seemed to know her 

I miss the touch 
Of her body so much 
I long for the warmth inside her 
Somewhere in time she will come back to me 
And I'll spend my whole life beside her 

[Chorus]",Spanish Eyes
Ricky Martin,"Met you underneath the moon 
Night was over much too soon 
We shared a kiss till daylight came 
And kissed the night goodbye 
When the sun came up that day 
We smiled and went our 
Separate ways 
But I can't leave the thought of 
You behind 

Oh you stay with me 
You stay with me 
Oh in my heart 
And on my mind 
Oh like a melody that keeps haunting me 
Oh you stay 

I look inside the small cafes 
And hope by chance I'll see your face 
I hear your voice and realize 
It's just the summer wind 
Something in your eyes that night 
Swept away this heart of mine 
Now I just want you in my arms again 

Oh, you stay with me

How was I to know in that one night 
My whole life would change 
From the moment I looked in your eyes 
I've never been the same 
And if I could have one chance to have that 
Moment back again 
I'd never let it end 
I'd never let it end 

Met you underneath the moon",You Stay With Me

Are you in it for money

Aye mama, you're my sweet mamacita
You've gone to my head, like too many margaritas
You say that you sing, that you're some kind of dancer
But the stars in your eyes, never reveal the answer
One fine day, you'll be walking out that door 
I hope you find, just what you're looking for

Aye mama, you're my sweet señorita
But if I should fall in love, will of your sweetness turn bitter
You swear that you'll stay, that you love me forever
But that's what you'll say to the next fool who's handsome or clever
One fine day, when your name is up in light
You will know what I am asking you tonight

Ricky Martin,"Amor, only in a dream
I ever thought you'd find me
Amor, fell into a kiss
And left the world behind me

Way to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now I look into her eyes
And I can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Deja, deja
Cuidado que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
Solo por ella

Amor, never was a touch
Enough to just persuade me
Amor, now that I can feel my heart
My thoughts evade me

Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now I look into her eyes
And I can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Ricky Martin,"Te tomo la mano y no siento tu mano
Nos damos un beso y no siento tus labios
En tus ojos no luce el azul del cielo
Te miro y lo que veo me parece extraño

Cuando se abre la puerta
No me late el corazón
Si en la noche te encuentro
Ya no pierdo la razón
Cuando estoy a tu lado no se me
Acelera el pulso
Tus caricias y abrazos ya no me queman

Cambia la piel y liberarte
De ese viejo amor que te hizo sufrir
Cambia la piel y límpiate
Todo ese rencor que no te haré bien

Volvieron los recuerdos que tanto
Te hicieron mal
Volvió la tristeza que te oprimí el alma
Y la amistad y el cariño que tanto
Nos unió
Cayeron en las redes de la desconfianza

Ya no tiembla tu cuerpo cuando
Hacemos el amor
Y a pesar del tiempo
Parece que nada sucedió
La complicidad que
Antes hubo entre los dos
Se subió a una paloma
Y se fue volando
Repetir coro

Cambia la piel y olvídate
Del resentimiento que ensucia
Tu sangre
Cambia la piel, cierra la herida
Que se abrió aquel día y que nunca curo

Cambia la piel y convéncete
Que vine por ti para hacerte feliz
Cambia la piel y llámame
Olvídate de ese viejo amor
Cambia la piel olvídate ya

Cambia la piel y cambia la piel
Y olvídate de ese viejo amor

Cambia la piel
Libérate, libérate
Cambia la piel
Cambia la piel

I hope someday you'll understand
My heart beats stronger when I know, close to you

Why must all of the love come falling
Why don't we just take our chance
I could walk this road again with you my love, oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where it leads

This is not the way we started, you and I
How was it that I lost my way
Two souls can drift apart without a word
Were those the words I did not say

Why must all of the dreams come falling
Why don't we just take this chance
I could walk this road again with you my love, oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some elusive dream

She gets a thrill out of lovin' and watchin' you sufferin'

Well I tell you my friend you could never resist her
And if you ever saw her, you'd know why

She holds your heart in her hand
She'll make you a man
But she'll play you however she wants
Just when you think that you're winnin'
Your head starts a spinning
You open your eyes and she's gone

Around those killer curves
That work my nerves

You've got a slit in your skirt
For your dirty work tonight

Here you come
You've gone from bed to bed to bed

Where would I be now?
Without the tenderness that you possess

That keeps me holding on

I need to be the one you see
I gotta justify the faith you have in me

You're the sun that lights my soul
You're the other half I need to make me whole
Who would I be now?
Without the warmth you bring to everything

Las cosas han cambiado entre tú y yo
Para mal o para bien
Me consumo en el vació de esta soledad
Y te busco más que ayer

Cuando ves que los sueños van muriendo
Desvaneciéndose en mi piel
No me dejes solo aquí con mi dolor

No temas ven a mi
Quiero calmar mi cuerpo junto a ti
Entrégame tu amor
Para matar este sufrir

Quédate mi amor
No me dejes solo aquí con mi dolor

No temas ven a mi
Quiero calmar mi cuerpo junto a ti
Entrégame tu amor
Para matar este sufrir

No temas ven a mi
Quiero calmar mi cuerpo junto a ti

There you are,

Lost the will to love

In the shadows

Come to come,
Come to me

De todos mis amigos
Qué me hallan diferente
Estoy tan destruido

Qué apenas soy la sombra
Soy un desconocido
Qué a veces ni respondo
Qué ya no soy el mismo

Y todos siempre piensan
Saber más de la cuenta
Lo sienten, lo conversan
Y de ello se alimentan

Mientras que la sangre aquí en mi corazón
Va subiendo arriba la temperatura
Mientras mi locura, va con tu cordura
Mientras yo te extrañe, yo te sienta, yo te ame

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Quizá yo le pido al
Amor demasiado
Quizá por exceso y
Demás he pecado
Quizá por costumbre
Tal vez por temores
No se porque si no se si hay
Razones

Quizá por demencia
Piedad o clemencia
Quizá por amarte, por
Necesitarte
Quizá porque lejos de
Ti es demasiado
Quizá porque todas
Mis necesidades las tengo de ti mientras yo te ame

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer

Y yo aquí muriendo y
Tu como si nada
Pero la razón me vuelve a controlar
Y dentro de mi es el
Dolor que habla
Que conversa a solas con mi soledad

Vienes, te apareces y te veo
Y es que aquí no pasa
El tiempo
Y yo muriendo

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido mujer, yo intento, yo intento

Yo intento, salir del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer
Yo no te olvido, yo no te olvido",Y Todo Queda en Nada

Era brujería o fantasía
No debía si era mía, no
Que dolor saberlo, era cierto
Como aceptarlo
No, no, no
Comencé a sentir quemando en mi
Un instinto asesino, whoa
El infierno conoció
Déjenme despertar

Que más da, solo quiero tu amor
Si ayer te dije que nunca más
Volvería amarte así
Pero sigues clavada en mi
Te perdonare
Que más da, solo quiero tu amor
No te puedo olvidar
Ni callarme el deseo de decir
Ven regresa a mi, te perdonare

Pasión fatal
Y el seguía
Solo ella podía notar
Que yo estaba ahí
Eso de su mirar
Moría desangrando, me
Como me pude enamorar
De quien mentiría así
Sin sospechar que ella
Vendría a burlarse de mi

Era brujería o fantasía
No debía si era mía, no

Te perdonare
Que más da, solo quiero tu amor
No te puedo olvidar
Ni callarme el deseo de decir
Ven regresa a mi, te perdonare

Solo fue un error
Un tremendo error
Dime por favor
Que aun existe amor
Peleare por ti
Pagare todo tu dolor
Solo fue un error, oh
Un tremendo error, oh
Dime por favor, oh

Que aun existe amor, oh, oh
Peleare por ti, oh, oh
Pagare todo tu dolor, oh oh oh oh oh oh

Should I leave, should I go, should I break apart
My mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you were sleazing, you're a slut, a ho
Now you wanna have a change of heart, damn
Who'd have thought
That you would deceive me
Love of my life
And my queen like Evie
And you didn't even tell me you leavin'

I had to hear about it on Escandalo T.V.
Now who's this man creeping in the back door
While I'll hit him with the fo fo fo
I know you keep saying that you lovin' me so
But why the hell are you crushin' him for
God damn now
I don't care that's what Ricky says and
If I catch him in this crib he'd be dead
I don't play that mami
Now back to the 'jects you go
I left your Reebok's by the front door, kickboxing

Que más da, solo quiero tu amor

I told you, so this is where you wanted to be
I told you, she never let me see the hotness that sound is provoking me
I told you that you're like an animal
I told you, have you naked on the floor
I told you, now you can let me go

There's a hundred people here watching the show

When I watch you, tell me you can hardly breath
I watch you, the thought of you watching me
Watch you, think if I go too deep

Ricky Martin,"[Chorus]
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Promised me
You'd always be
You'd never let me go
You took the ring and
All the things that came with being my girl

The tragedy as I walked through that door
You had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
It was just like a movie
Too real to be
That just can't be my bride to be, no

I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

[Chorus]

Crazy boy was he just kept going
'Cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I've fallen so in love
With someone I'd known for years
Not even know that
She'd be the one
To reveal my worst fears

It was just like a movie
Too real to be that just can't be my bride to be no
I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

[Chorus]

I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to

I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do, oh, to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to

Should I leave should I go
Should I break apart
My mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you would sleaze you a slut a hoe
Now you want to have a change of heart
Who'd have thought that you would deceive me

You're my queen like Evie
And you didn't even tell me you leaving
I had to hear about it on Escandalo T.V.
Now who's this man creeping in the back door
Out to hit him with the fo fo fo
I know you keep saying that you loving me so
But why the hell you crushing him for, god damn now!

I don't care that's what Ricky says
And if I catch him then he'll be dead

Ricky Martin,"Sorry babe, won't forget all about you
Can't deny, all the ways that I've hurt you
All I know, life is harder without you, gone away
Baby I won't desert you

I was so lost, I was so gone and you so lonely
I didn't realize the things I've done to you
There's no excuse there's not a way that I convince you
It's hard to find someone that loves the way you do

You are the breath that fills my soul, oh
You know that now the road's my home
And it's calling me on and on

Sorry babe, won't forget all about you
Can't deny, all the ways that I've hurt you
All I know, life is harder without you, gone away
Baby I won't desert you

You want it all but all we have it's just this moment
I can't promise you anymore then that
So baby look at me and we can make it through this
I never meant for this to make you feel so bad

You are the breath that fills my soul, oh
You know that now the road's my home
And it's calling me on and on

Sorry babe, won't forget all about you
Can't deny, all the ways that I've hurt you
All I know, life is harder without you, gone away
Baby I won't desert you

Sometimes it feels like, every road leads me back to you
Sometimes it feels like, the thought of you take me home
Takes me home, and it takes me home, takes me

Doing what we need to feel alive 
And I feel so right

Crossing all the lines, taking any chance 
Doing what we need to feel alive 
Yeah it feels so right,

Why una red de mariposas colgando en el balcón
Por si el viento deja alguna historia ahí enredada 
Why notas olvidadas sin rasgos de tu ausencia

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, tengo que arrancar de mi memoria 
Cada verso que empezaba con tu nombre

Quedaran algunas letras en errante melodía
Un puñado de palabras a medio terminar
Cuando el tiempo deje este camino abandonado
Sin llegar a ningún lado why desnudo de tus huellas

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus besos
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria 
Cada verso que empezaba con tu nombre

Esta es la última vez
Que canto tu nombre
Tu nombre

Esta es la última vez

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo 
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, antes de cerrar mis ojos
Tengo que olvidarme de tu piel
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria

Todo ha sido puro y natural 

Tu loca mania 
Has sido mia 
Solo una vez

Luego te levanteas y te vas

Luces tu sonrisa mas normal 
Blanca, pero fria como nieve 

Tu loca mania 

Y mientras yo me quedo sin ti 
Como un huracan rabioso y febril 
Tanta pasion, tanta osadia oh, tu 

Fuego de noche, nieve de dia 

Noche a noche en blanco sin dormir 
Ardo entre los pliegues de mi cama 
Se que estas a punto de venir 
Pero solo viene la manana

Hoy mi tristeza no es pasajera
Traigo fiebre de la verdadera
Y cuado llegue la noche
Cada estrella parecera una lagrima

No me digas nada

Quisiera ser como todos
Pasar feliz por la vida
O finguir que estoy siempre bien
Ver el color de cosas con humor

No me digas nada

Que lo malo siempre pasa
El futuro sera bueno
Todo pasa

Cuando todo esta perdido
Siempre quede una salida
Cuando todo esta perdido
Siempre brilla una luz

Manana es otro dia mejor

Pero hoy, porque me siento asi ?
Baja del cielo un angel triste cerca de mi
Y esta fiebre que no cesa
Y mi sonrisa se seca

Cuando todo esta perdido

No, oh me digas nada

Mirame en silencio
Y muchas gracias por pensar en mi",Gracias por Pensar en Mi [DVD]

No hay pasos que no dejan huellas

Llegamos desnudos a este mundo
Inocentes frente a Dios

Quién es alta sin caer y del fuego renacer
Van a hablar, me van a acusar,

Ricky Martin,"We can talk, you can make your demands
We can cry, catch the tears in our hands
We can laugh and dance
Under this fading moon

And when the morning comes
I'll still be holding you

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our hearts be synchronized

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

I know you would catch me
Should I fall from grace
If I heard you drowning in the dark
I'd dive into the waves

We can make a vow and seal it with a kiss
The moments that we shared will matter more
Than those we missed

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

In another place, in another time
In another space, in another life
In another world you could still be mine
We'll shine, we'll shine

Shine, brighter than a rain of fallen stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night, there's no goodbye
Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars

Ricky Martin,"Mi corazón es un cazador
Adicto al calor de tu piel, al sabor de tu amor
Tus labios son mi cruel obsesión
La sed y el hambre de la seducción
Dominan en mi ser
La sombra que ves, no es una ilusión

Te busco y te alcanzo
Me pierdo en tu llanto
Te quiero en mis brazos
De frente temblando
Te busco y te alcanzo

Soy flecha perdida
Te busco y te alcanzo

A donde vas, yo te voy a atrapar
Te escondes de mi pero al fin
No te vas a salvar
Sera tu error, será tu olor
Como un animal,
Has asado a mi boca
Y quiero devorar tu cuerpo acariciar
Te quiero tener, amar sin piedad

Oh
Por que siempre huyes de mi?
La trampa mortal
Es querer lo que no es para ti
Es un desastre total
Por qué el ser humano es así

Están envenenando tus fantasías
Te siguen provocando de noche y día
Te estas atormentando con una espina
Oh

Mordiendo tu sonrisa
Y amarte hasta caer
Perdido en tus caricias

Sudando entre las sabanas
Volverte a recorrer
Jugando con malicia

Embrujados, encendidos
Indecentes, escondidos

Se han prendido de tu piel

Al borde de tu cuerpo
Saber que estas ahí
Dibujándome los suenos

Y al despertar morir
Prendido a tu belleza
Llorar hasta reír
Burlando la tristeza

Dame la sal que el mar se robo
Bebe de mi boca desesperada
Déjame bañarte con mi sudor
Dame la furia de tu mirada
Dame el veneno de tu pasión
Deja tu perfume sobre mi almohada
Para respirar de tu olor

Tell the brother, good old days
When you could dance the night away
Someone give me a time machine
So I can live just for today

You gotta take time, time, time for the moonlight
You gotta make love, love, love with your whole life

Chico was a 'rican from Manhattan
When he wasn't working
He would DJ for his friends underground
He could spin you like ninja

Ricky Martin,"Tu me haces falta como sol en el verano
Diploma en el graduado y pasaporte al viajar
Te necesito mas que la guerra a un soldado
La pensión del retirado y una boda con su altar

Voy a extrañarte mas que al cable a la corriente
El veneno a una serpiente y la selva a un animal
Te echo de menos como ropa a su perchero
Amar sin tener celos y un diamante sin tallar

Dime que hacer
Pa librarme de tu veneno
Que introduce tu boca en mi piel
Te escapas como agua en mis dedos no puedo

Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
De tu cara, tu boca, tu pelo
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
De la forma que tocas mi cuerpo

Pienso seguirte como un siervo buscando una excusa
Poeta con su musa y a un político a ganar
Y amarte despacito como carne en el asado
Un bolero encantado y una historia sin final

Dime que hacer
Pa librarme de tu veneno
Que introduce tu boca en mi piel
Te escapas como agua en mis dedos no puedo

Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
Cuanto me acuerdo de ti
De tu cara, tu boca, tu pelo

Ricky Martin,"Aquí va mi confesión
Antes de ti no fui un santo
He pecado como no
Pero eso es cosa del pasado
Desde que llegaste tu
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causo
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón

Cuantas noches de pasión
Cuantas mañanas tan vacías
Y un error tras otro error
Con estas sábanas tan frías
Desde que llegaste tu
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón

No entendí cómo pasó
Con la destreza de un buen francotirador
Cada una de tus balas en el alma me pegó

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto con un disparo al corazón",Disparo al Corazón
Ricky Martin,"Tierra,
Aquí nació mi canto, mi bandera,
Sonrisas que se cuelan por la puerta del balcón,
Y este viaje que hoy me trae de vuelta.

Lejos,
No sabes cuanto echo de menos,
El ruido de mi pueblo y la caricia de este mar,
Cuando no estoy contigo yo te invento.

Traigo oxidado el corazón, me hace falta cuerda,
Mi alma necesita transfusión, sangre de mi tierra
Regreso a la cuna que me vio nacer,
Regreso a ese barrio que me vio correr,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.
De vuelta al refugio que calma el dolor,
Y huele al recuerdo del primer amor,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.

Lento,
Las marcas van contándome que el tiempo,
Es como un pasajero que se sube en tu vagón,
Y anuncia que la vida es un momento.

Dicen,
Los viejos de la esquina siempre dicen,
No importa lo que tenga si al bajar de la estación,
Uno regresa siempre a sus raíces.

Traigo oxidado el corazón, me hace falta cuerda,
Mi alma necesita transfusión, sangre de mi tierra
Regreso a la cuna que me vio nacer,
Regreso a ese barrio que me vio correr,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.
De vuelta al refugio que calma el dolor,
Y huele al recuerdo del primer amor,
Lo que fui, lo que soy y seré por mi isla bella.",Isla Bella
Ricky Martin,"Mi estrategia no funciona al tiempo
Y la razón para ser tu rival
Desarmame, enfrentame.
Y si me hicieras preso de tu cuerpo
Esa condena cumpliria hasta el final
De tanto amar, soy criminal.

Es un suicidio probar de tu boca si después te escapas.
Eres tú, en mi piel acaricia en la herida.

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir mas bella que en tus brazos lento.
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
Sin ti.

Esta armadura que soporta el fuego
Se vuelve frágil a tu voluntad
Disparame, si eres capaz.
Mi tortura es saber que mañana
Nada cambia todo sigue igual
Porque te iras, sin avisar.

Es un delito quitarte la ropa y que después te vallas.
Eres tú, de mi piel acaricia la herida.

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir mas bella que en tus brazos lento.
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
De nuevo sin ti.

Que me quiero, que me quiero, que me quiero ir contigo

De luz que antes te guiaba
Yo era todo para ti

Como un regalo, algo divino
Justo en el momento que más dolía
En la tormenta desatada en mi velero a la deriva
Vi en tus ojos en el mar en calma
Tu voz me dijo no pasa nada
Y naufragaron tus manos por mi espalda
La almohada fue testigo del placer que derramaba

Como le dices que te vas
De una manera tan cobarde
Como le dices que te vas
Si justo empezaba a enamorarme
Quien callara esta soledad
Que me pregunta sin respuestas
Tú me viniste a rescatar
Y me abandonas como isla desierta

Vuelvo a caer en el combate
Me toca perder tras jaque mate
Intento no olvidarte por más que trate
Eres como droga y como adicto salgo yo a buscarte
Y al final te veo, sonríes, me atrapas
Tal si fuera un reo, desarmas de nuevo mi alma
Robando de mi cuerpo lo que queda hasta saciarte
Úsame pero no te marches

Como le dices que te vas
De una manera tan cobarde
Como le dices que te vas
Si justo empezaba a enamorarme
Quien callara esta soledad
Que me pregunta sin respuestas

No es la duda al entrar
Eres tú, eres tú es la esperanza
Que me invita a dejarme llevar

A quedarme sin armas, a quitarme el disfraz
A entregarme sin falta, solo al verte llegar
Y a sentirte en silencio
En silencio, cuando aquí ya no estás

Aquí queda, a quién quiera escuchar

Si lo encuentras, hazlo para siempre

Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

La la la la, la la la la
Can we still be friends?
Can we still get together sometime?

We awoke from our dream
Things are not always what they seem
Memories linger on
It's like a sweet sad old song",Can We Still Be Friends?
Ricky Ross,"There's gonna be trouble from the start
When you break somebody's heart
You hope the damage does them good
Like it does you
You put a rock around my heart
And you know the killing part
Is Sunday morning
When nothing rolled away

[Chorus]
Cold
Easter
It rained on the parade
Cold
Easter
God everything`s the same

I took the car through where you'd been
I couldn't see anything you'd seen
I thought riverside drive
Went on and on
And I got a chill right through my soul
When I found out the ride can't go
Round forever and forever
Amen

[Chorus]",Cold Easter
Ricky Ross,"Good evening
Philadelphia
I can't believe what I just said
I got up again
Like a monkey
And I raged right through the set
We went outside
Into an autumn wind
Running scared from the crowd
Headed out for an all night cafe
Where the waitresses got off on singing loud

I'm just a small town noise
I'm just a
Small town noise
I'm just a small town noise
I'm just a
Small town noise

Easy does it
Washington D.C.
What a state you're in
Looks like you've cracked
A hundred hallelujahs
Through
Fifty nights of sin
You get hungry for some leg over easy
Or packing someone`s pistol in the hood
It doesn't mean
You're not as fucking boring
As some dirty dark river that don`t move

[Chorus]
I'm just the village voice
I'm just the
Village voice
I'm just the village voice
I'm just the
Village voice
I'm just the village voice
I found out that

I realize
I need you
More than you need me
I realize
I need you
More than you need me

Goodbye
Denver Colorado
Goodbye Portland Maine
So long
Baden Baden
So bad they named you once again
We'll be breezing through the
Windy city
For the
Last time you`ll see
The only way the traffic`ll stop
Is if some angel flies down and touches me

I need you
More than you need me
I realize
I need you
More than you need me",Good Evening Philadelphia
Ricky Ross,"You come
Awake
And lie in a bed
Of fevered state
You rise
Again
And open a curtain
To find only night
Coming in
The dream
Comes back
Your up on the stage now
Slumped collapsed
Everything is blurred
The people come
They come at you all at once
The man at the front says all he wants is jack singer
I`m so sorry
For what I've done
Against all forecasts
I've been the one
Who turned the world round
And made it pass
Through hell`s own corner
God we made it at last
I`m here
Tonight
Up on the stage now
Doing my thing
And that`s all
The worst
Thing ever
Is to sing to the gods
And discover nothing coming back
That`s all there is there",Jack Singer

You can feed me darling
You can keep me even
But I don't pretend that
It all means anything

Unless we're lovers baby
Don't come and go
We only sleep through the world
And the world doesn't know
About lovers baby
We wait a long time
But once it all happens
It all comes right

There's no evidence darling
There's no steps in the sand
I couldn't even place
A ring on your hand

And we waited our time
Till the waters had rolled
And the clocks had chimed

But it would only
Bring you down again

Here's to you girl
To you and me into the
Bright blue yonder
We had it coming
A little bit of what you like
Will only haunt you

Your eyes will open
Your eyes will open to the light
You'll maybe not like it
If what you like's what made you blind

There's an old man
Used to pass this way so much
He seems to know it
It seems a shame that we've lost touch
It wouldn't scare me
It wouldn't scare me if he spoke
It wouldn't scare me
It wouldn't scare me if he spoke

They found the car out in the lake
A crowd had gathered on the shoreline
Two tons of black on steel plate

Hung above the surface like a prize catch
Wriggling till the water disappeared

Just as the dawn had hit the sand
Sun caught her heels and summer cotton
An extra rock out on the land

Kids dropped their nets and ran over
And saw the tears upon the skin
And how her gold and pearl earrings
Couldn`t stop the water coming in

And the foreign stage
Maybe at last

Better place

Hand of fate

You want to take what you can get

Next you say leave

Now coyotes bark and the sky's so dark

To come riding out of nowhere just for me
Someone to take the reins and circle all the wagons
And start the fire for our cowboy jamboree

To tell about their loss
And the camera finds them beaten up by grief
Do you wonder that they get up every morning
And sometimes don't believe?

Of another day not shared
With a child who never turned to say goodbye
Are you comforted by somebody you love
Or do you keep it down inside

Can you feel?, Can you
From every breaking dawn
Through to midnights ghostly toll
I thank him for the life
In your northern soul
Every time you cry
And sulk back to the fold
Through your misty eyes
I see your northern soul

When it's down to just page seven
Even on a slow-news day
Do you pause before you turn over the page?
And although there is no photograph

No tears on television
Do you find yourself reminded of their eyes?
Can you feel?
Can you?

At every roadside shrine
Where faded flowers console
I shudder for the life
Inside your northern soul

Every night you sleep
I'll lie down on your pillow
And I feel each steady breath
From your northern soul

When every light's gone out
And my body's tired and old
You'll keep my spirit young
With your northern soul

I'm bound to make it so
To turn all fear to love

It seems there's a longing for you still

In our little cabin home on the hill

Oh someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill

I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so i won't be alone

And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let your thoughts turn back once more if you will

That she loved another one better than me

The dance floor was crowded and I wasn't long
When up stepped a stranger, I never had seen
He asked my darlin', ""Will you dance with me?""

I knew I had lost her, the one I loved

Hello sadness, cries my inner soul
Goodbye lover, moans my voice

Perils today are many
As I set out on my way
If I lose your love, I know that I
Can't call it back someday
Rambler, lonely rambler
Just calls any place his home
But Nashville's lights
How beautiful you shine

Wishing now that you had found
A word or two to say
But the morning came and we both knew
My eyes gave it away
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye
I thought, only time will tell
And you can't draw water from an empty well

[Chorus]

Two highways lay before me
Which one would I choose?
Down one lane I'd find happiness
And down the other I would lose
There is no one that I can trust
I must decide alone
My decision is an awful one
Which road will take me home?",Two Highways
Ricky Skaggs,"I've been living a new way,
All the life that I love so.
But I can see the clouds are gathering,
And the storm will wreck our home.

For last night he held you tightly,
And you didn't even shove.
This is true for I was watching,
From the window up above.

You must have thought that I was sleeping,
And I wish that I had been.
But it's best to get to know you,
And the way your heart can sin.

I thought we belonged together,
And our hearts fit like a glove.
I was wrong for I've been watching,
From the window up above.

From my eyes, a teardrop started,
As I listened on and on.
I heard you whisper to him, softly,
And our marriage was all wrong.

Well, I hope he makes you happy,
And you'll never lose his love.
I lost mine while I was watching,
From the window above.

How I wish I could be dreamin',
And wake up to a love that's true.

Nothing can hurt you
No one can hurt you

Well I finally got over the words that you said

By hurting each other so bad

Left over from a love that don't last
There's a time in the morning when I roll back to sleep 
'Cause I don't want to remember our past  
It amazes me darling how the heartaches we keep

I went right down to see old Bob, 
I thought he was my friend.
The landlord said that Bob's not here,
The police done hauled him in.

Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Ricky Skaggs,"Off somewhere the music's playing soft and low.
And another holds the one that I love so.
I was blind I could not see
That you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go.

Now, I'm crying my heart out over you.
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new.
Ever since you went away
I die a little more each day
'Cause I'm crying my heart out over you.

Each night I climb the stairs up to my room.
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom.
I miss your picture on the wall
And your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over you.

Don't give up on believin' in me. 
Heart broke, who kept me from leavin',

A small consolation but I know just how you feel.

When to that station flagged that hummingbird down
I didn't even call to say goodbye

Ricky Skaggs,"I took my mark for the sounding of the gun
The challenge for your heart had just begun
I never knew I would cross the finish line
I gave it all for the chance to make you mine
From the word love I knew I won the race
From the word love I came out in first place
From the word love my dreams were coming true
All because of you
You cheered me through from the word love

Ricky Skaggs,"He's been wounded already in the struggle of life
Battered by raging storm of strife
Caught in a whirlwind of heartbreak and pain
And blinded by it's driving rain

The innocent victim of crimes of the heart
Has witnessed his young world being torn apart
He can't understand why mom and dad
Have forsaken the family they had

So he whispers his prayer every evening
As he kneels by his bedside alone
""Put mommy and daddy together again
And give us a happy home
Please give us a happy home""

At night he could hear them in their room down the hall
The anger rang clearly through his bedroom wall
He silently listened, tucked snug in his bed
To each bitter word they said

Now he and mom each have a room of their own
He sees dad on weekends and they talk on the phone
His questions need answers but all they will say
Is ""You'll understand why someday""

So he whispers his prayer every evening
As he kneels by his bedside alone
""Put mommy and daddy together again
And give us a happy home
Please give us a happy home""

Oh, he tries to act just like he's a man
And hold all the hurt inside
But it's hard for a little boy to understand
Grown-up reasons for goodbye

So he whispers his prayer ever evening
As he kneels by his bedside alone
""Put mommy and daddy back together again
And give us a happy home
Please give us a happy home""",Give Us a Happy Home

Ricky Skaggs,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend

Ricky Skaggs,"There's a cold rain falling on my window pane
Drop by drop it just won't stop spelling out your name
There's a wild wind howlin' chills me to the bone
All I can do is think of you and your heart of stone.

Every sleepless night I pray and hope it will be true
When I wake up in the morning I won't remember you
You say someday I'll forget you and fall in love again
Well if you're so smart won't you tell my heart when.

There's a full moon rising just like the one that shined
On the night you held me tight and told me you were mine
Now there's an empty feelin' where my heart used to be
The day I die I'll still ask why you walked out on me.

I spend every waking hour trying to let go
Won't somebody show me how I've just got to know
You say someday I'll forget you and fall in love again
Well if you're so smart won't you tell my heart when.

I hate to hear that mournful sound
I'm all alone and so downhearted
Since my true love ain't around 

I hate to see that sun a-sinkin'
Another night to toss and turn
Another night to dream about her
Another night for her I'll yearn 

She had no cause to go and leave me
For I had never done her wrong
She left her home and little children
Out with another man she's gone

Ricky Skaggs,"Now listen here, drunken driver
While here on earth you dwell
You never know when the time will come
When you'll have to say farewell

I saw an accident one day
Would charm the hearts of man
And teach him never to drink a drop
With a steerin' wheel in his hand

This awful accident occurred
On the twentieth day of May
And caused to loving children
To sleep beneath the clay

These two dear kids walked side by side
Out on a state highway
Their lovin' mother, she had died
And their father had run away

They were talking of their loving parents
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curve came a speedin' car
With a drunk man at the wheel

The driver saw these two dear kids
And hooted a drunkard sound
""Get out of the road, you little fools""
And the car had brought them down

The driver staggered from his car
To see what he had done
His heart sank within him
When he saw his dyin' on

He then picked up his little one
And carried him to his car
Then leanin' on the runnin' board
He prayed a drunkard's prayer

Sayin', ""Please, oh Lord, forgive me
For this awful crime I've done""
His attention then was called away
To the words of his dyin' son

Sayin' ""Take us to our mother, Dad
She sleeps beneath the ground
It was you and her we was talkin' about
When the car had knocked us down""

""And please, dear Dad, don't drink no more
While drivin' on your way
But meet us with our mother, Dad
In heaven some sweet day""",The Drunken Driver

With a dram glass in her hand
She's drinkin' away her troubles
She's a-courtin' another man

Last time I saw little Maggie
She was sittin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four all around her
And a banjo on her knee

Pretty flowers were made for bloomin'
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty women were made for lovin'
Little Maggie was made for mine

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

That everything created here on earth all had voices singing
Every rock and every blade of grass even the ivy that was clinging
Every leaf and every drop of rain all had voices singing.

It brought the angels down in my dream so clear
Then the Lord sat down so that he could hear
The sea and waves were rushing to the shore
With the joy that they were bringing
A sound so perfect that it made me cry to hear their voices singing.

Gonna have more fun than a tree in a coon
Tonight's the dance of the cajun noon.

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Pick ups and wagons 'round the river road shack
Bonfires draw in a crowd out back
Step through the door and I see my Sheri
That's when I see her mamas eyes on me.

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Guitar, a squeeze box, a fiddle, a bow
Little band a-playin' every song they know
Old woman sittin' there and yellin' for more
My heart is willin', but my feet - they're so sore!

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Once more we're waltzin' to Jolie Blond
I lean in closer and Sheri responds
Her mama's smilin' as we slip from the room
To sit and stare at the cajun noon.

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon",Cajun Moon [Live]
Ricky Skaggs,"I'm going away to stay awhile
Just to ease my worried mind
You never cared for me my love
So I'm leaving you behind.

It's been this way so long my dear
Why can't you understand
Your selfish heart broke up our home
Just for another man.

I tried to live my life alone
All through these lonely years
I keep your picture here with me
Just to dry these bitter tears...
",Your Selfish Heart
Ricky Skaggs,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”",I Heard My Mother Call My Name in Prayer
Ricky Skaggs,"[Chorus]
Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door

I honky-tonked around Dallas
Got in a poker game
Somebody must've been a-cheatin'
I lost everything but my name

Well I walked halfway to memphis
Finally got back home
I'd have been better off where I was
'Cause here's where things went wrong

[Chorus]

I went downtown to see 'ol bob
Thought he was my friend
The landlord said that bob's not here
""The Police done hauled him in!""

I ran right back to little honey's house
I got me a rockin' chair
""now honey if you don't open that door
I'm gonna rock on away from here""

Ricky Skaggs,"Another day, another chance
To right the wrongs, begin again
All you can do is do your best
Shake off the past, forgive yourself

It's just the world we're living in
Not many saints too many sins
You're not alone, we're all inclined
To slip and fall and cross the line

We live and learn with each mistake
To get back up, thank God for grace

Lift up your chin, brush off the dust
And wash your hands off the things you've done
Sometimes you fall, sometimes you fly
It's only life, enjoy the ride

As long as you have air to breathe
Then you have all the time you need
To give your love for all it's worth
And make amends to those you've hurt

This is your life for heaven's sake
Redeem yourself and thank God for grace

Lift up your chin, brush off the dust
And wash your hands off the things you've done
Sometimes you fall, sometimes you fly
It's only life, enjoy the ride

Sometimes you fall, sometimes you fly
It's only life, enjoy the ride
It's only life, enjoy the ride

Another day, another chance",Enjoy the Ride
Ricky Skaggs,"I got me in bed and covered my head
Wish I was dead with Sally Jo
Sally Jo, where did you go Sally Jo?

Since you have gone my days are turned to night
Nothin' goes right Sally Jo
Sally Jo, where did you go Sally Jo?

The hurt you left has just begun to show
Sally Jo I've been so low
Sally Jo, where did you go Sally Jo?

I'm like a little dog left out to stray
No one wants me no place to stay
Sally Jo, where did you go Sally Jo?

Did I do bad or was I good to you
Yes or no, Sally Jo
Sally Jo, where did you go Sally Jo?

For me to see Sally Jo

Ricky Skaggs,"Kick your shoes off in the corner
Mama, tuck 'em babies all up snug
Sis' Draper's comin' over
We all gonna cut a rug

When you see that lantern swingin' yonder
Comin' up the Holler Road
Them dogs'll get to barkin'
Ought to tie 'em all up with a rope

Now, you boys better get in tune
Sis' Draper's gonna be here soon
Don't shoot no dice nor get too tight
If you're gonna pick with Sis' tonight

She came down from the Boston mountains
There was lightnin' in the air
Honey on them fiddle strings
Magnolias in her hair

Now, she's a diamond in the rough
If you can't see the shine that's tough
She'll play all night for the likes of us
Sis Draper's got the touch

She'll play all night if she feels like it
Drink some fruit punch if you spike it
Sis' don't care who don't like it
See, ol' Sis has got a heck of a bow arm on her

She stepped right up and sawed one off
And uncle Cleve dropped his jaw
Said she's the best I ever saw
She must be from Arkansas

Now, I think grandpa used to date her
Grandma said she still hates her
All the fellas stand up straighter
In the presence of Sis' Draper

Sis' Draper is her daddy's daughter
Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

She put her fiddle in the box
And said it's getting awful late
She's on her way to Little Rock
And Little Rock can't wait

So, we all stood there in the yard
Hands full of watermelon
Watched her leave and watched her go
Wishin' we was in that wagon

Sis' Draper is her daddy's daughter
Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

Play it Sis'

Ricky Skaggs,"Sometimes this crazy world can make us all feel bad
I sit and watch the news and just get mad
We need to stop and smell the roses in the ground
So get out today, you spread a little love around

Talk to a neighbor, volunteer a favor
Help out a stranger when his car's broke down
Give your wife a kissin', when your kids talk, listen
It makes a lovely sound, spread a little love around

You know it don't take much to make somebody's day
A kind word of tender touch goes a long way
We can change the whole world if we start in our hometown
So get out today, you spread a little love around

Tell your mom you love her, bear hug your brother
Treat your sister to a night out on the town
Throw the ball for rover, wrestle in the clover
Put a smile on that old hound, spread a little love around

Slap your sweetheart's fanny, tickle on old granny
Dance with the kids and act just like a clown
A little tiny kiss and hug, well everybody needs that stuff
Turn a frown upside down, spread a little love around
When this world gets you down, spread a little love around",Spread a Little Love Around
Ricky Skaggs,"She came from the backwoods
Bright teeth, stylish hair
Good fortune and everyone's smiles
Followed her everywhere
Had a taste for the good life
Had some stars in her eyes
Thought she would have it all
Once her name was in lights

Hey, hey little Miss Jane
Sunny day turned to hard rain
Traded in your evening gown
For a jumpsuit of pain
The beauty queen and the wallflower
Feel the same in their darkest hours
All watch as the crown of jewels 
Falls from the old guard tower

She walked down the runway 
A crown of jewels she wore
Applause and lights, but at the end of the night
She was the first out the door
Drove all night at high speed 
Arrived in the early day light
Flash of a knife, a nice evening dress
Couldn't change her man's mind

Hey, hey little Miss Jane
Sunny day turned to hard rain
Traded in your evening gown
For a jumpsuit of pain
The beauty queen and the wallflower
Feel the same in their darkest hours
All watch as the crown of jewels 
Falls from the old guard tower

Stage moms and hair-sprayed charms
No one there could have sounded an alarm
I don't know why you think it's so strange
Any kind of act is within anyone's range

Ricky Skaggs,"Here we go to the Tasty Freeze
Or maybe Dairy Queen
If so, then better lock the glove
There's something in there the old man loves
To break it out with a muffled shout
A shout of glee and it comes out

The dreaded spoon, the dreaded spoon
Lord help us, it's the dreaded spoon

Well, hide your cookies and hide your cakes
What he giveths, away he takes
He keep on scoopin' till you taste just great
So better not turn your head away

It's gone, gone, gone
They're gone, gone, gone
To the dreaded spoon

Says he doesn't want a thing
He's not hungry, he says with a tiny wink
We come back with a big ol' cone
And he makes his move and we all moan
Wearing out your ice cream cake
Spilling sprinkles in his wake

The dreaded spoon, the dreaded spoon
Lord help us, the dreaded spoon

Well, hide your cakes and Sunday pies
Apple fritters and curly fries
Nuts and cherries piled so high
Just one swipe and it's say goodbye

Yes, bye, bye, bye
They're gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone

Ricky Skaggs,"The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find, I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Running down by the lake shore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

The boat's steaming in
I watch the side wheel spin and I
Think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go",Mandolin Rain
Ricky Skaggs,"Van and Willie went out one night
Once they get out on the road
Well then everything is alright
Had to get away from the kids and the wives
Well they ran into some city boys that didn't walk just right
And the line was drawn for another showdown
Like they'd always seen it done
And when the lights came up on the little woods town
There was an old man bailing out a son

Going out to the smoke and trees

Said do what your daddy told you
Well I just went out and did that

There's a green table down at the midway
Where they rack up the balls for the games
And reputations are made
There's a green forest full of oaks and pines
Where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
Where secret scores are settled
And the claim was made round the table that night
And they rode off through the trees
And the young boys tell how the city boys tried
And how one man fell to his knees

That I told her of her love

That's where I first met her I thought that I knew her
She turned my world around, she turned a country boy upside down
But she turned out to be just another night time bird on the wing
She turned out to be just another wild eyed dream.

Then over in Georgia east side of Georgia
That's how far I followed her she was gorgeous
She turned my world around
Well, how come every time I go downtown
She turned a country boy upside down
But she turned out to be just another night time bird on the wing
She turned out to be just another wild eyed dream.

Well, how come every time I go downtown to have a good time
Some little sweet thing comes along and leaves me the tab for my last dime

a great big ring on a great big loan
She turned my world around, she turned a country boy upside down
But she turned out to be just another night time bird on the wing
She turned out to be just another wild eyed dream

I'm goin' home now goin' back to the farm now

A story I remember as a kid
About a man who tried to tell his wife he loved her
And the strong and simple heart felt way he did

He said, I thank the Lord for blessing me with feelings
And the strength to work and live the way I do
And then I asked my two most wanted wishes
Let me live with love and die with you

Now the woman in that story was my mama
So I'm passing on a family legacy
And when I tell you that I feel just like my daddy
And every night I fall down on my knees

Holdin' you and that little baby boy
His hair would have been blonder
And his eyes would have been blue
If that was me in the picture with you

With all respect I didn't mean to show my feelings
I'm thinkin' things that I have no right to say
Someone ought to write a song

Ricky Van Shelton,"God bless my daddy, I learned so much from him
He taught me at an early age I had to sink or swim
He said, ""Boy, that old river of life can wash away your dreams
But you gotta keep right on kicking and swimming upstream""

Before I knew it I was out there on the street
That old gal they call lady luck she wasn't kind to me
As a matter of fact you could say she was down right mean
She kept me in way over my head and swimming upstream

Swimming upstream, swimming upstream
Fightin' every inch of the way for a poor boy's dream
Things will get rough, times will get lean
But the only choice you got is keep swimming upstream

Every time I think my ship is comin' in
That old tide will turn and it'll take me back out again
If I just lay back and float I'll be in trouble you see
So I gotta keep working and kicking and swimming upstream

Has a wondrous attraction for me;

I've got the radio blastin'
I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads
On the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin'
Hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads
All my troubles are behind

Well when I woke up this morning
Well I took me a look outside
It was plain to see it was one of those days
Tailor-made for taking a ride
So I went downstairs and cleared my head
With coffee and cigarettes
And when it hit me right there
Then my mind was set

Well I phoned work and told'em
They're going to be a man short today
I got the sunny day blues, there's only one thing
That's gonna make them go away
So I went out and I climbed in to my big ol' Chevrolet
And with a turn of the key and a cloud of dust
I was on my way

REPEAT CHORUS

Well maybe I did maybe I didn't
Go and lose my job today
But you can take my cares, take my worries
And blow them all away
For there comes a time in any man's life
When he's got to break free
I got four good wheels and an endless road
Stretched out in front of me

OF that I couldn't find
Is he touching that old switch

But since they left that little yard looks a little rough
And God I miss that little boy who always kept it mowed
Wish they still lived where the tall grass grows

Than face those burning mem'ries where the tall grass grows

Ricky Van Shelton,"He was sitting beside me 
In the passenger seat
As I looked through the windshield
At the quiet little street
He was smiling so proud
As he gave me the key
But inside, I knew 
He was as nervous as me

I said, ""Daddy, oh daddy
Are you sure I know how
Are you sure that I'm ready
To drive this car now""

He said, ""I'm right here beside you
And you're gonna do fine
All you gotta do
Is keep it between the lines

Where it leads in the end
But you got to begin
So keep your hands on the wheel
Believe in the things that are real
Just take your time
And keep it between the lines

I was sitting in my chair
And sneaking a look at him
Lying on the floor with his coloring book
Then he caught me watching
And he climbed on my knee

He said ""Daddy, oh daddy
Would you do one with me""
Then I hugged him so tightly
As we turned the page
Said, ""I haven't done this
Since I was your age""

He said, ""I'm right here beside you
And you're gonna do fine
Daddy, all you gotta do
Is keep it between the lines""

So we finished the picture
And I put him to bed
Got down on my knees and I bowed my head

I said ""Father, oh father, I feel so alone
Are you sure I can raise him
With his mommy gone""
Then the answer came back so gentle and low
In words of my daddy, from so long ago

He said, ""I'm right here beside you
And you're gonna do fine
All you gotta do 
Is keep it between the lines""

She pulls off the road and the door flys open wide
She says 'hey boy looks like you need a ride'.

Like drowning in honey
Being beaten with a velvet glove
Shot with a golden bullet
Still you can't get enough of Lola's love.
No you can't get enough of Lola.

Late one night you'll be on the lawn starin' up at Lola's room
While the red hot blues flow out of her radio
You're gonna wind up in her bed sure as there's a moon above
And son that feelin' ain't never gonna let you go

Being beaten with a velvet glove
Shot with a golden bullet

Ricky Van Shelton,"Well, I think I get the message I'm not deaf and I'm not blind
But the signals that I'm getting have caught me by surprise
It seems that you've decided to just get up and go
But if the reasons here are oh so clear there's one thing I've got to know.

Where was I, I wish I knew
You say it's all over baby I'm confused
Wasn't that you in my bed it must've been all in my head
When love finally said goodbye where was I.

I didn't hear the train a comin'
I didn't see the boat I missed
I didn't see the stop sign on the corner
And I'm sure that I didn't see this.

Ricky Van Shelton,"I don't know how she stole it I don't even know when
I'm not sayin' there was fore thought or malicious intent
But with it in her possession she disappeared in the dark
But wherever she is she still has my heart
It might be in Oklahoma that's where she called from last
Could be Denver could be Dallas she's been known to move fast
Now and then I hear rumors that she's back in these parts
But wherever she is she stil has my heart
She had deep blue eyes I thought I could trust
Tennessee drawl and an innocent face
I had no ideal she was dangerous
Till I gave her my heart she just walked away

Ricky Van Shelton,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And mild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had roll'd along th' unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bow'd my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day

Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun.

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh.

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Ricky Van Shelton,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

Ricky Van Shelton,"I should have noticed this when
You started turning up in sad songs
It should have hit me when
You began to sing along
I should have realized when
There were tears in your eyes
Every time a song was through
It was more than the music
I was losing you

I should have seen it when
You started watchin' those late, late movies
And you'd sleep on the couch
Instead of sleeping next to me
When I'd wake up in the night
Sometimes I'd hear you cry
But, baby, I never knew
It was more than the movies
I was losing you

I wish you had screamed
And yelled out the things you held deep inside
'Cause I never dreamed
That our love was dyin' right before my eyes

But I should have felt it on
Those too few nights I held you
Oh, I should have known
All those whispers weren't true
There was a reason why you never looked in my eyes
And it breaks my heart in two

I was losing you

Rico J. Puno,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Turn the lights on

Your pussy so good
I wanna put alarm on it
Like baby food, I wanna put my tongue on it
If you’s a stripper baby
I’d put the ones on it
I love getting on that liquor
And going dumb on it
I want it off the market
Put it in the freezer
And when I slide through
You can unfreeze it
You got flowers in
You got that good seed
Like being in the rain
You get wet easy

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good
I swear
Turn the lights on

You won’t get the voicemail
I answer you first call
Even if your light red
We still talk
You're like sushi, baby
I give it to you straight raw
And I’m breaking bread, you the first off
You like Florida to me, you stay warm
I’m the real Energizer bunny
But the hood version I keep going
We start off with kisses
You hear me snoring
I show off your finesse
Then I hit you with bam bam bam

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse

Turn the lights on

When it come to the snatch, you a poster child
When it come to get it in, you versatile
When it come to the threads, got your own style
When it come to me, though
Make you throw in the towel
Your back cute, your ass better
My ex was good, but you even better
Need to run for office, the White House
If it’s bout how good your sex is, you gon' win hands down

Are you lovin' somebody else?

Well I've been playing checkers and you was playing Tetris

Too many skeletons in my closet, too many devils
Too many elephants in the room, I need a shovel
To maneuver through the manure all we do is settle
Arguments about (about), all my whereabouts (whereabouts)
All the girls I was with (I was with), all the reason that I'mma be without (without)
But I'm honest enough to admit, I shoulda honored your bluff
The material stuff there's hardly enough
Now when I'm calling it's like I'm calling with what
Now I know I shouda buy me a tux (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

How many times you cried in a year

But tonight I'm confessin'
I might need her to give me a lesson
Say baby can you teach these old boots to burn
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
Takin' my number and waitin' my turn
Cowboy's comin' from miles around
Just to be her partner when the two-step comes around

Honey, please won't you show me
I might fall, baby, you'd better hold me
Yeah, bein' out here takes a lotta nerve
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
Takin' my number and waitin' my turn

But I'll follow you 'til I get better
We can go all night as far as I'm concerned
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

Baby can you teach these old boots to burn
I can't, I can't, I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

Ricochet,"I've done my time alone
I finally beat the blues

Had some dreams fall through

Thought I knew all about keepin' myself prepared

Ricochet,"I knew she was trouble when she asked me to dance
And two songs later things got out of hand
Well, she gave me a ride in her brand new car
Going ninety miles an hour underneath the stars
And we went too far

By the time we pulled over on that old dirt road
We were fogging up the windows and out of control

I thought I had a heart that could never be tamed
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing
But one small kiss can go a long, long way
You gotta be careful when you play this game
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing

We made wild promises in the dark
Then we filled up the tank at the Quickie Mart
Now, you can call us crazy or call it fate
But we were headed for Vegas on the Interstate
We just couldn't wait

We found a little chapel called The Burning Love
'Cause something 'bout that girl had me all shook up

I thought I had a heart that could never be tamed
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing
But one small kiss can go a long, long way
You gotta be careful when you play this game
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing

The preacher looked like Elvis and he started to sing
As he reached in his pocket for a pawnshop ring

He said, ""Congratulations boy now, it's all arranged""
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing
But one small kiss can go a long, long way
A little bit of love is a dangerous thing

I thought this battle is harder 
Than an war that we've fought

I meant it when I said it but the truth is I lied

Is it asking to much to forget and forgive 
Dying for your love 
Is no way to live

When you looked at me like that
Quicker than a finger snap
I saw you and me forever in record time

La gloire, la réussite je te les laisse si tu les veux
Elles ne représentent rien qu'une illusion d'une vie meilleure
Je construirai ma route en attendant mon soleil bleu
Certaines valeurs ne brillent jamais dans les yeux d'un aveugle
Si l'artifice s'approche de trop je lui mettrai le feu
Qu'importe les conséquences, depuis tout petit j'en ai fait le vœu

Sans doute que la vie n'est qu'un moyen
Pour se rendre compte que nous sommes rien
D'autres que les mêmes truffés d'amour
D'autres que les mêmes truffés d'amour
Et de tant de haine

Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, y a-t-il quelqu'un là-haut ?
Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, il fait trop chaud en bas


Il fait si froid en bas…",Répondez-Moi
Ridan,"T'es une star du petit écran
Tous tes amis te l'ont dit
On dit de toi, le garçon dans le vent
Tu as déjà ce petit don
Que les gens appellent talent
Vu que tu chantes, depuis bientôt un an
T'as fait tes classes à la Starnac'
Du coup t'as quitté tes parents
Pour le triomphe et pour son bel Arc
Et pour percer le grand mystère
De la réussite sur terre
D'être une star, minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Tu es né pour être une star mon grand
Pour faire briller les yeux de tous ces gens
T'arriverais même à faire chialer les chiens
T'es une star minute, une star minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Faudrait que t'écoutes tes professeurs
Les conseillers seront les payeurs
D'ailleurs bien plus, je pense tes détracteurs
N'oublie jamais que t'es qu'un amateur
Bien observé par ces matteurs
Enfermé par ce drôle d'animateur
Au vu de l'audience de ce vendredi
Que penserai-tu de te travestir
En jeune dandy, bellâtre de la rive gauche
Ou en rocker un peu rebelle
À la chevelure couleur débauche
Tu seras une star, minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Tu es né pour être une star mon grand
Pour faire briller les yeux de tous ces gens
T'arriverais même à faire chialer les chiens
T'es une star minute, une star minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Cela fait cinq ans que t'as pris l'eau
Que racontent-ils ces beaux salauds
À ce qui paraît, t'aurais pris le melon
Et qu'entre deux rayons de légumes
On trouve toujours de bons navets
Pour faire une soupe, un peu trop populaire
N'oublie jamais de remercier ton bel ami patibulaire
Qu'a fait de toi un bon bouc émissaire
C'est vraiment con pour les Artistes
Tu sais, tous ceux qu'on dit « les vrais »
Qui se donnent du mal…
Mais qu'on écoute jamais

Tu es né pour être une star mon grand
Pour faire briller les yeux de tous ces gens
T'arriverais même à faire chialer les chiens
T'es une star minute, t'étais une star minute
T'en savais rien",Star Minute

Cause a coincidence
Could never happen every single day

I'll be leaving out of town on Tuesday
I'll be leaving but I wish I could stay
And I only wish I had the nerve to say

I want you to know
However things may go
That you are always on my mind
It doesn't matter where I'm at
I want you to say
That you feel the same way
Cause I know I see you sometime
You know I never have come back

I wonder if you think
About me like I think about you
Right before I go to sleep
It's obvious to me
That this is fate 
I know every time I see you on the street

I'll be leaving out of town on Tuesday
I'll be leaving but I wish I could stay
And I only wish I had the nerve to say

I want you to know
However things may go
That you are always on my mind
It doesn't matter where I'm at
I want you to say
That you feel the same way
Cause I know I see you sometime
You know I never have come back

Time to say goodbye for now
I don't want to say goodbye for now
Wish I could stay
But it's time to say goodbye
Goodbye

I'll be leaving out of town on Tuesday
I'll be leaving but I wish I could stay

And nothin ever seems to change
And everything I love
I'm watchin waste away

I just can't fake it
And I don't want to believe
But this time I just can't take it

I don't want to wake up some day

there's no many things on my mind
Just another day in my life

If you're not happy everyday
Well I could end it all and then they'd say
that's its so to believe
I always thought he'd make it
and now we never will get to see
well I guess he couldn't take it?

Hold me, gently take me through another day.

I crawl when I should fly.
I wander through my days,
Pulled a million ways.

Help me learn, until I know too much, I'm still without.

Hold me in my fear.
And sleeping I can't hide,
I'm paralysed inside.

They never noticed a word,

My waiting is over, there's no visitor for me.
Never let me talk to you, destroy the frozen past,
It's a different time now thing's are moving much to fast.

I'm not asking, I'm telling you.
I'm watching, I'm listening,

Hesitance belongs to yesterday.

Riders in the Sky,"Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas
The Western Superman to say the least
He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter
'Cause he never had no fear of man, nor beast

So yippee-I-ay-I-ya, yippee-I-o
He's the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Pecos roped through raging cyclone out of nowhere
He saddled it and straddled it with ease
While that cyclone bucked and flitted
Pecos rolled a smoke and lit it
And he tamed that ordinary wind down to a breeze

So yippee-I-ay-I-ya, yippee-I-o
He's the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Pecos lost his way while traveling on the desert
(Water, water, water)
It was ninety miles across the burning sand
(Water, water, water)
He knew he'd never reach the border
If he didn't get some water
So he got a stick and dug the Rio Grande

While a tribe of painted Indians did a war dance
Pecos started shooting up their little game
He gave those redskins such a shakeup
That they jumped out of their makeup
That's how the Painted Desert got it's name

While reclining on a cloud, high over Texas
With his guns he made the stars evaporate
As he watched them all declining
He left one brightly shining
As the emblem of the Lone Star Texas State

Rides Again,"This is what it's like to be alive
Wide awake, I open up my eyes
Tell me what this life, it really means?
When nothing in my head is what it seems

Sooner or later
You’ll be the shadow
Crawling in my head

Take it or leave it
You’re like a sickness
I am infected

This is what its like to be alive
Darker days have taken up my time
A little change is all I really need
Take me down a road, I’ve never been

Sooner or later
You’ll be the shadow
Crawling in my head

Take it or leave it
You’re like a sickness
I am infected

When everything is going wrong
Turn around and carry on
Just the pain of saying goodbye
You can leave this world tonight

You were meant to feel the sun
Burn away from everyone
When you feel so far from hope
Close you eyes 'cuz

Sooner or later
You’ll be the shadow
Crawling in my head

Take it or leave it
You’re like a sickness

Ridgedale Singers,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Je ne sais pas.
Je t'avais dit que je te laisserai jamais.
Mais je ne te supporte pas.
Tu m'as tellement donné d'amour.
Et je t'ai rien rendu en retour.
Et fais toi une raison mais c'est quoi cette fille.
Je crie ""Au secours"".
J'ai pas envie de venir vivre chez tes parents.
Et toi quand tu pleurais.
Beh moi je trouvais ça marrant.
J'comprends que c'est fini aujourd'hui plus que jamais.
Comme Gainsbourg, je suis venu te dire que je m'en vais.
Gauche, droite, quel est la bonne direction?
Oh, pas notre relation est en flexion.
Tu veux une situation, moi un peu de réflexion.
J'oublie les bons moments.
Je ne retiens que nos frictions.
Pourquoi le fait de te parler me fais partir au quart de tour?
Pourquoi quand on se balade j'ai l'impression de faire Paris-Tour?
Pourquoi j'ai plus envie de toi?
Plus envie d'y croire?
Plus envie de voir nos deux visage dans le miroir?
Je sais que c'est pas de ta faute j'aimerais pouvoir changer les choses.
Si notre histoire est un poème je veux changer des proses.
Pourquoi je ne vois plus cette lumière qui scintille dans tes yeux?
Cette nuit j'ai fait un rêve et je crois qu'on était deux.

Mec, marie-toi avec ta mère.
Tes potes, ta musique!
Et qui a le meilleur derrière?
Moi je te laisse réfléchir.

T'es encore là ou quoi?
Vas-y ciao ciao, bon vent, bon vent

Tant pis si je finis seul.
J'me fous de ce que tu fais!
De qui tu vois!
Qui tu parles et où tu vas!
Je te souhaite de finir seul.
Non je n'ai pas le seum, stop, silence et sors.
Reprend tes affaires sales
Enlève tes pieds de mon sol.
Je suis comme ces gars que tu juges et que tu fous dans le même sac.
Les mêmes phrases j't'aime pas.
Dis moi plus ""J't'en supplie rappelle moi.""
Ne fais pas genre j'veux un mec droit.
T'aimes les coureurs de jupon, les bad-boys.
T'aimes ceux qui te font du mal.
On reconnaît la classe d'un homme aux femmes qui rappellent pas.
On est tous des conser' mais que ferais-tu sans moi?
Après tout c'est une embrouille,
J't'en pris reste cool.
Souhaite moi du bonheur.
Merci, c'est tout.
Et me casse pas les murs.
C'est déjà assez dur.
Tu me le répètes sans cesse.
Je suis déjà assez nul.
On trouvera mieux ailleurs.
D'ailleurs c'est déjà fait.
En-fait on s'appelle tout à l'heure, tu me manques mais j'ai la flemme.

Ridsa,"Ça faisait la belle à l'époque,
Tu pensais qu'à eux mais aujourd'hui où sont tes potes.
Là ou je cédais le passage, j'ai appris à mettre des stop.
Tu gaspillais les sentiments quand moi j'en mettais en stock.
En fait, toi tu jouais, pensant connaître le score.
Moi je te courrai après, là c'est à toi de faire du sport.
Triste est le sort quand la magie n'opère plus.
L'amour n'est pas aveugle, lorsque les yeux ne pleurent plus.
Plus d'un tour dans mon sac, j'ai dû faire mes bagages.
Je faisais du sur place, alors que je rêvais de voyages.
Je suis parti sans me retourner, pas question de reculer.
Sachant bien qu'un jour ou l'autre, la roue allait tourner.
J'avais les épaules assez larges pour supporter tes caprices.
T'avais le rôle principal, t'étais une putain d'actrice.
Maintenant tu t'en mords les doigts, car ta main ne trouve plus la mienne.
Moi, j'la lève jusqu'au ciel en chantant à la tienne.

A la tienne,
La roue tourne fallait pas jouer,
J'lève mon verre trinque à ta santé.
A la tienne,
Tu paies tout le mal que t'as fait,
Loin de toi, moi je me suis refais.

Moi, je progresse,
Ne retourne pas la terre entière pour quelqu'un qui ne retourne que sa veste.
Faut que tu me laisses, oui ça blesse.
Souvent l'amour frappe fort, moi j'encaisse.
Fallait réfléchir avant, et non agir après.
Un cœur a trop de valeur, ce n'est pas un truc qu'on prête.
Aujourd'hui, t'es prête,
Mais rappelle toi tes faux départs.
Moi j'fais pas de cinéma, mais quand j'dis j'pars je pars.
Et tu cherches mes bras, mais le temps j'l'ai pas.
Garde ton hypocrisie et ne t'en fais pas.
Avant tu calculais tes coups, Aujourd'hui tu comptes sur moi.
T'as multiplié les fautes, maintenant tu connais le résultat.
Dur de rester fort, mais bon quand t'as pas le choix,
Faut s'accrocher,
J'ai beau trimer, j'suis toujours resté droit.
Maintenant tu t'en mords les doigts, car ta main ne trouve plus la mienne.
Moi, j'la lève jusqu'au ciel en chantant à la tienne.

A la tienne,
La roue tourne fallait pas jouer,
J'lève mon verre trinque à ta santé.
A la tienne,
Tu paies tout le mal que t'as fait,
Loin de toi, moi je me suis refais.

C'est trop facile de revenir.
T'as plus de chance de gagner à l'Euro million
Que de regagner ma confiance, aller sans rancune

La roue tourne fallait pas jouer,
J'lève mon verre trinque à ta santé.

Comment t'explique qu'on soit devenu deux inconnus? 

Je pense a nous , a nos délire 
A ceux qu'on as fais, a ceux qu'on as pu vivre 
On c'étais dit quoiqu'il arrive 
Qu'on ferais tout pour s’unir 

J'ai vu des gens souhaités de vivre ceux qu'on vivaient 
Complicité venu d'ailleurs j'pouvais misé 
Qui aurait cru un jours que tout s'arrêterais 
Un choix contre cœur nous as tué 

Au fond ta mal ,mais tu te cache 
Tu ne regarde pas la réalité en face 
Mais tu le sait 
Toi et moi on se retrouveras 

Hier on pouvait pas se quitté on étaient accro 
Ensemble on quittés la terre suffisait quelque mots 
Et tout nous réunissaient on était fait l'un pour l'autre 
J'ai du mal a m'y faire qu'au fond tout ça étais faux 
Comme deux inconnu maintenant on se croise dans la rue 
J'avoue ça ma fais bizarre ce jours ou je t'ai revu comme nos regard on s'évitent

Ridsa,"Parfois on s'ouvre
Parfois on souffre
Des fois on s'aiment
Parfois on souffle
A quand mon tour? 
Parfois j'étouffe
Elle dit je t'aime, je fait le sourd
Parfois je crie
Dès fois je rie
Personne m'entend, seul dans le vide
Tant de chose a dire, mais on évite
Je fait semblant, ici tout va vite
Il suffit de briller
Et les fantômes s'invite
Dois-je oublier? 
Dois-je vous laisser fuir? 
Envie de vivre je me jette à l'eau
Face à moi-même je me dévoile
J'ressent des choses mais j'trouve pas les mots

Dois-je m'en aller, m'en aller, m'en aller? 
Dois-je m'en aller, m'en aller, m'en aller? 
Dois-je oublier, oublier, oublier?

Le jour se lève, à t'es coté
Suis-je dans un rêve ou une réalité? 
Sommes nous ensemble, sommes nous liées? 
J't'ai vue disparaître et j'ai réalisé
Parfois mieux vaut s'en aller
On t'envoie des signe mais tu ne peut les voir
Le temps pourrait tout recoller, on l'sais
On m'dit que je suis pas le même
J'évite le regard des gens
La passion prend du ferme
Quand la fierté prend l'devant
Le ravie nous malmène
On s'laisse guider par le temps
On aime les problèmes
On apprécies quand sa dérange
Aller oh oh
Qu'est-ce que tu connais oh oh
Faut pas déconner oh oh
Laisse-moi oublier oh oh

Elle me prend la tête, elle me lâche pas
Qu'est-ce que je fais? Elle veut savoir
C'est normale, c'est ma wife
Mais des fois, elle en fait trop
J'lui fais du mal, j'suis maladroit
Au fond, je m'en veux j'avoue c'est chaud

Quoi que je fasse, elles reste là
Elle m'épaule, elle fait tout pour moi
Faut que j'me reprenne, que je fasse le taffe

Pourtant, j'ai des choses à dire
J'ferais tout pour son sourire, et comme un con j'la fais souffrir

Y'a qu'à regarder ses yeux et ceux de leur meuf pour comparer
Des fois, je la vois maronner car ma fierté veut pas se barrer
J'fais le gamin, je lui ris au nez mais je sais comment la calmer

Juste un peu profiter

Juste rouler, me barrer

Tu peux être sûr que tu vas briller 

Tu demandes parfois 
Si je pense à toi 
Car je ne le dis pas 
C'est pas contre toi 
S'il te plait laisse moi 
On se reverra 
C'est toi qui a changé 
Quand moi je suis resté le même 
Ne t'étonnes pas si je ne réponds plus à tes appels, non 
Je n'ai pas oublié d'où je viens ni ce que j'ai vécu 
Toutes ces barrières que j'ai franchi 
Sans rien lâcher 
Non je n'ai pas négligé tous les signes que j'ai reçu 
Oui j'ai souffert mais j'ai souri, je me suis forcé

Pour d'autres elle est blanche 
Entre cauchemar et rêve

Je fais le tour de Paris 
Posé sur ma Vespa 
La queue devant les clubs 
Dans lesquels je rentre pas 
Je dis que je vais me coucher tôt 
Mais à chaque fois je rentre tard 
Les bords de Seine remplis 
Par une foule agitée 
Ce qui se passe dans ma ville 
C'est pas ce qu'on voit au JT 
Et entre les sirènes et les rires 

Je me suis fais à l'idée 
Quand quelques secondes 
Tout peut si vite basculer 

On s'y retrouve mais on peut s'y perdre 
Entre les mégots et les tickets par terre 
Des fois c'est sombre mais on s'y fait

Accompagné ou solo 
En voiture, à pied en vélo 
Les poches vides ou remplies d'euros 
Non j'ai pas besoin de tel-hô 
Je reste pas devant la télé 
Expliquez moi l’intérêt

Y'a de quoi devenir taré

Hé les gars on se capte illico si y'a des ptites femmes 
Des ptites failles pour faire des folies 
Une petite flamme et ça s’enfume 
Ça sent plus mais ça sent bon

Elles se croient tout permis 
Même les plus grosses gratteuses 
Ont toujours leurs vernis

Rain water, roof taste, Pistol Pete
White Louis suitcase, with the singin' hook like Frankie Lymon
Shout to the Baywatch, David Hasselhoff hair
Or the Allen Iverson braids, zig zags on designer
Softened beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup
Edge up, I done got fed up
Ate the pork chop sandwich with the tartar sauce
In the packet that I found in my purple Prada pocket protector

You ain’t supposed to be here, yeah your name wasn’t on that list
We even checked the email that was sent from up above, or rather all around us
Screams in my dreams like a One Direction concert, so
We’re on our own, so alone in the universe
We sent people to the moon and now we know just the two of us

I knew it, he bullshit, he up his own anus
Instagrams with his fans, man, he wish he was famous
Stop talking about your heart, we give a fuck, entertain us
Why this nigga the lamest, why his clothes so the plainest?
And I know the ones who hate us, be the sames to say we made it
Man fuck the vindicated, and the faded, at least they influence
How do we become the God? Language we learned in fluent
Understand who you are, they told us to be patient
But it’s pointless like the use of emojis in conversation
Question mark face
What does it mean?
It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens
But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terio
Yeah, you getting your shine, but nigga, are you eating, though?

If you're welcome, are you fine?

When I got grown and dropped out of school
Nobody was broke with me, but now they all wanna roll with me

Walking 'round town, rock twenty K below

Rocking all this snow, might freeze a rainbow

Step inside the club and I'm smelling like Miami
In the kitchen cooking cookies, but I'm not yo damn granny
Now they wanna copy cause I'm wetter than tsunami

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Each thing depends on something 
And I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money or spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame baby, for what I do
I know that I can be a beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know dear 
You can help me on
Wouldn't it hurt to know dear 
All my hopes were gone
Wouldn't it make you proud dear
If I made a name
But if I failed to win dear
Would you want all the blame",It All Depends on You

The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end

From my quiver
An arrow for my bow
Pull it really hard
Let it really go
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
King of kiss he done nothing for me yet
Kisses his cross and genuflects
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
The lord of love in his old cold castle
Moats bone dry, silly old rascal
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
I could be arrested for the way I'm thinking(chorus???)
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
Come on, come on
Hammer nails in wood
Brick by brick we can make it real good
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
Come on, come on
Give me love
Give me trust
Believe it or not
I love the serious stuff
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
I could be arrested for the way I'm thinking(chorus???)
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
'cause I could
I did what I did
Take it to the girl
Take it to the bridge
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
Because I could
I hit where I hit
Straight to the heart
Between the lips
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
I could be arrested for the way I'm thinking

Rigo Tovar,"Me haces daño mi bien
Con tus mentiras
Y tus caprichos también
Me haces daño mi bien
Porque me finges amor

Hoy recuerdo también aquella tarde
En que a tu vida llegue
Cuantas promesas de amor
Y hoy resulta
Que impuesta estabas a mentir

Y ahora que lo se
Una racha de temores atormentan mi ser
Pero una tarde me iré
Como aquella
En que a tu vida llegue

Y partiré, tu me veras
Y en tus pupilas verdes
En la distancia me perderé
Mientras con tu corazon hablaras
Por tu conciencia castigada seras

Me marchare y quizás llorare
Y en mi camino cabizbajo
Me preguntare
Si el tiempo me ayudara
Porque después de tanto amarte
Que pasara,no te molestare
De tu lado me iré

Porque a pesar
De tantas cosas, en silencio
Partiré, partiré, partiré,
Partiré, partiré, partiré,
Partiré, partiré, partiré.

Amor, me voy de ti por falta de comprensión
Me alejo y a través de mi largo camino

Rihanna,"Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' cock-spur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt
(Pause) We runnin' clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go Re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your cookoo
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it
Get it?

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya
The way that I do

Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie (I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover (I love it when you)
Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy

Oh, oh!

Oh

Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side.
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw water on my flame

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

Rihanna,"It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again

Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then (baby)
My heart remembers when (my heart remembers when)
And I realize I've never gotten over you (oh I never)
Every time I hear your name (every time)
It's like the sunshine through the rain (the rain, no no)
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again (baby, here I go again)

Oh
(Here I go again baby)
Oh

Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss dem days when we used to chill (used to chill)
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril (West Nigril)
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when (baby I remember when)
And I realize I've never gotten over you (I've never gotten over you)
Every time I hear your name (every time I hear your name)
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'

Rihanna,"Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear

Rihanna,"Took a chance
Rolled the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can't you see
It’s the way it’s gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know

Rihanna,"Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train
The way he said my name
The brother had a lot a game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
Cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you
I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you don't, whatever
And I know its meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I won't make you sorry

Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away, away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like the season's love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away, away

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

Does he still look just like you?

It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Just testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and
Not to mention good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No I won't apologize for feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me
Boy it's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share you
You might think I'm greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
What I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

Rihanna,"Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be

It's real late
'Bout a quarter to 1
I'm thinking about everything that we've become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us

It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it

This is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

I wish that you could hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away

You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath that I'm a stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other

I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel

Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

Getting out of control

I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core, you know

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams

So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I want to love, give him my trust
I want to live, for both of us
I want to breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you, when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me

So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough uh

Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness (oh oh)
So pick me up when it's over, it don't make any difference (oh oh)
Will it ever be solved?
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a cold case love (oh oh)

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes couldn't see, no
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind that you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough oh oh

Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness (oh oh)
So pick me up when it's over, it don't make any difference (oh oh)
Will it ever be solved?
Or am I taking the fall? (Ooh no)
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love oh oh

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime

Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart, beating,
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!

Never, have I ever
Been a size ten in my whole life

What you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, hmm

They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating oh girl
Why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right

Silly of me to keep holding on (oh)

That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie

Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie

I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

I will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried

Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times punch you in the face

'Cause every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you

A phone is ringin' but the message can't get through
A whisper on the wind as the sun goes down
A teardrop crashes to the ground and

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks
That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

Two people cryin' over broken vows
A door slams shut on an empty house
It echoes on down where the well is runnin' dry
Words lost in sentences we can't understand
A ring is slippin' off my fingers and slippin' through my hands, and

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks
That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

Blue notes on an old guitar, the silent fire of a distant star
The unforgiving rhythm of November rain
Rivers that are runnin' down a broken windowpane

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

Love you more than words can say?
Who will build their world around you
And stand beside you all the way?

A shoulder you can cry on
Who will pick you up when you fall
Who will come running when you call

Who'll be there for you
When all is said and done?
Let me be the one

Who will help you write the pages
In the story of your life?
And who will promise you tomorrow
Every single time you kiss goodnight?

Who will love you always and forever
As you face this crazy world together?
Who will make you smile through your tears
And who'll share all your secret fears?

Who'll wake up beside you
When each mornin' comes?
Let me be the one

Let me be the one your heart will know
The partner of your soul
The one who laughs and cries with you
The one who lives and dies for you

The only one you need
To share your hopes and dreams, darlin'
I can handle any fate that comes
If you would only let me be the one

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

To go and listen

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it dime

Tappin' toes 
And beggin' him don't stop

And fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy who played the

And he would play

And no one ever saw him 'round
He vanished like the breeze
They forgot him in the little town

Still dreamed about him

And then one day

Discours d'un jeune en arabe

[Couplet 1]
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Originaire de Barbacha dans la petite Kabylie
Ou Nechtakarrom, les figues, les olives et ses arômes, les Hanouts
La douane et les excédents de bagages,
Cette coutume et ce mode de vie auquel on s'attache
La population assommée par le prix du kilo de viande
Au casse pipe même pour un Doro, jeune hittiste dans la contrebande
Atteni l'garro, des Rym Boro, l'ennui à s'en taper la tête dans l'hitt y'a pas d'boulot
La misère dans la rue la devise, les devises avant les deux bises, la bouche pleine d'Chemma
Qu'est ce que tu feras plus tard ? -J'sais pas khallina tranquille!
T'es plus un jeune t'as plus de 20 ans et t'as même pas un chez toi
Naal Shetane, tu gamberges entre deux pannes de courant ou d'eau courante
Ça reste incomparable avec le vécu de nos grands parents
Qui nous alimentent de leur savoir vivre, un trésor dans ce monde crapuleux
On leur a inculqué les valeurs très jeunes
La plupart illettrés ont vécu huit ans de guerre violente, la famine, le peuple engagé
Beaucoup ont vu la mort de près, perdu des proches pour arracher notre liberté
La fierté de nos moudjahidins, pour tout le sang coulé lors de la bataille d'Alger
A tous les pères de famille âgés qu'en ont bavé
Qu'ont le moral qui dégringole avec l'économie du pays
Chaque fois qu'augmente le Smic en France, au Bled c'qu'augmente c'est l'Smid
Éduquent les nôtres avec l'Nia
Un homme qui n'se consacre pas à sa famille n'en est est pas un
La religion rallie la communauté qui se surpasse pour vivre, tout est ghali
Comment ne pas penser à Paris ?

[Refrain]
Le manque de khedma, l'ennui, le stress, l'envie de bien faire
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Algériens, Musulmans, frères montrés du doigt mais fiers
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Pour la famille on souffre, assume ce qu'on est jusqu'au dernier souffle
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
On pense à Reudwa , à fonder une famille, au visa et aux papiers militaires
A nos anciens qu'ont connu la guerre

[Couplet 2]
La première vague d'immigrés a servi à reconstruire la France
Pour des modiques sommes dans les travaux publiques
Pas fainéant quand le réveil sonne, le regard de nos anciens en disent long
Respect aux pères qui construisent nos maisons au Bled en dix ans s'il le faut
Depuis la guerre, méprisés, indésirables à la télé y'a des rebeus sur le câble
Branchés, câblés sur Al-Jazira et les chaines du Bled
Comme au bled là-bas, il s'imagine qu'ici c'est le Club Med
S'il savait que c'est plus galère que la file d'attente du Consulat
Quand tu postules à un emploi mais qui veut croire en toi ?
Hamdoulah on a la fois c'qui nous aide à tenir
Ça m'rappelle une phrase que j'ai vu sur un mur du Bled
""Mais où est notre avenir ?""

[Pont]

[Couplet 3]
Un coup de fil du pays, une commande, ils veulent des vêtements de marque
Chaque année un zinc débarque pour recommencer sa vie
Wesh Rak cousin? -Pas si bien que ça
Quand il voit que les bars sont remplis d'ârab
On a acquis une mauvaise réputation, nos mères s'inquiètent
Sortir sans papier est synonyme de complication
Un brin francisé mais me demande pas si je compte circoncire mes gosses
Par le Shétane courtisé, c'est vrai

Sa vie prend tout son sens autour des siens, près des siens

Intact c'est le son des capuches, du grabuge, capitche
Depuis minot on a compris le truc
Un beat crade, un track de plus
Intact Prohibé notre rap
Inspiré des impactes de balles sur le plafond des halls
Des estrades aux stades on avale les saisons, rôdent, arrosent le beat
Fini l'époque où on se renseignait sur les tarots
On est allroad, c'est l'équipe d'en temps, c'est old school dansant
C'est dans le sang, c'est un rêve d'enfant

Kéry James
Intact ce qui est sûr c'est que mon cœur ne l'est pas
Les impacts l'ont trop de fois brisé mais le mic R.I.M.K. me l'a sé-pa
Du 9.4 j'envoie ça pour tous les quartiers
Banlieue sud, est, ouest et nord, tout le monde sait qui a détenu le hard core
Banlieue sud, est, ouest et nord,
lève ton bras que je remette tous les ghettos d'accord
D'abord j'ai écris comme j'ai vécu
T'as vu j'ai perdu comme j'ai vaincu
Quand j'avais la rage, que je squattais les cages d'escaliers
Liés avec des fous alliés
Rebelle j'crois que ça se ressentait dans mes textes
Dis leur, le manque d'oseille se ressentait dans mes gestes
Ma musique était fidèle à mes convictions
Conforme à mes actions quand j'étais sur une mission
J'ai chanté la douleur des miens
Quand j'étais déchiré entre le mal et le bien
Je suis resté vrai et fidèle à moi même
J'ai lutté pour le peuple et non pas pour le système
Même je n'ai plus rien à prouver
La rue est avec moi, j'aurai bien pu la soulever
Si tu me demandes pourquoi mes textes ont changé ?!
Je te réponds ne vois-tu pas que ma vie a changé

Refrain (x2)
Voici venir Kéry James et Rim K
Intacts depuis le début dans le pe-ra
Tout près du haut pourtant venus d'en bas
Ayant connu le sens du mot ler-ga
Va dire à ceux qui parlent mais qui ne savent pas
Q'au show business on ne sert pas d'appas
Où que tu sois kiffe ça et lève ton bras
Yeah ! Kéry James et Rim K

RIM-K
Extériorise ce qu'on ressent
Intact, exposé aux risques présent malgré les bévues
A nos caves cadenassées y a pas de 22 long rifle, pas de vip
Je viens d'Afrique chez nous ils touchent le sol le PIB venu d'en bas
On a grandi, changé, évolué avec le rap avec la rue
Jusqu'à l'aube sur les parvis ou en garde à vue
Une adolescence instable du système jamais esclave
Visé quand la répression s'installe
Le trafic continue mais les gueules changent
Intact, issus d'un lieu où très peu de mecs se rendent
9.4, peu de mecs graciés plein de mecs planqués
Dans les branches du banditisme
La misère à deux bras on l'a embrassée
Intact, on étouffe les BAC, on fait rougir l'Etat
Nos raps subissent les taxes
Toujours autant de balances
Ca part d'un coup de fil d'un fax
Dis leur c'est le mec d'en face
Vitry - Orly - Camille Groult - Demie-Lune Zoo - Kéry James - Rim K

Personne n'est à l'abri de la prison ou d'un sale coup
Le vécu donne de l'ampleur au message
Au lieu d'écouter y'en a trop qui parlent
Chaque année y'en a trop qui partent
Micro platine du parc au parking
Partis de rien, derrière moi mes connaissances corrosives
Pour le plaisir de la famille en featuring

Kéry James
Aussi vrai que la rime de mon ami Karim
Et tranchante la mienne aujourd'hui est consciente
Et alors tant qu'elle reflète mes pensées
Pourquoi chanter la guerre si mon cœur aspire à la paix
AP, sans être grossier
Et sans stress à l'aise avec mes vitriots du Hall 13

Excès de vitesse

Excès de fous furieux qui finissent sur un lit d'hôpital sous sérum
Excès de fioles, valium, rupnoll

Du jugement aux assises
Beaucoup de sexe même les minots pratiquent
Excès de folie

Les clones
Les braqueurs déguisés en clown
Les fans de Johnny ou Claude François
Je vais faire mon trou
Toi aussi on se fait des trous dans le corps, dans le ghetto pour s'asseoir sur le trône c'est comme ça depuis une décennie voir plus
Excès de décès c'est ni de ta faute ni de la mienne mec
Par les temps qui courent les excès de jalousie et de chatte usée
Il te faut un gilet et uzi qui va avec
Et une boîte de capotes
Les garces usent ton chibre
Les barjots et les blindés font l'amour avec des ustensiles
T'es au courant ça sniffe plus de rustine
Excès de Hagla sur les frérots en Palestine
Excès de shit dans mes urines
De jean dans le boule
De névrosés
De fouleks

Rim'k,"Chez nous très peu de personne décède de mort naturel,
Soit attentif quand t'on parle d'islam, quand on te fait le rappel.
La liste est longue lourde, jusqu'a Landres et y'a pas l'ombre d'un doute.
Plus d'un de mes potes serait à cuba en train de manger des langoustes.
Sur tous ces drames, on prend des risques c'est pas a nous le monde,
La rue nous les a pris sans rien demander ce monde est fou.
L'essentiel je l'ai compris, partir avec la sensation du devoir accompli,
Chacun vit avec ses problèmes, sans qu'on s'en rend compte.
J'en ai pris conscience quand j'ai vu ce mec brûler vif à la pompe,
Parti lors d'accident mortel de maladie ou de leurs propres grès ou leur rime querelle.
Toujours la même grande peine qui t'empêche de fermer les yeux pendant des jours,
Qui te rappellera qu'on partira sans voiture ni bijoux.
Je connais des mecs qu'ont perdu père et mère,
Tu peux remuer ciel et terre, personne est éternelle une forte pensée pour mon paternel,
Même si dans parlé ca me fait mal, Nasser falbé,
La liste est longue le prochain c'est peut être moi qui sait,
L'ange de la mort passera me voir comme toi, tu sais.
Je sais c'que j'raconte on doit tous rendre des comptes,
Finis de se comporter comme des cons
On sait pas quand commence le compte à rebours.
Chaque fois que j'arbore les ruelles de ma ville pleine de rbal, je remarque que


Refrain (x2)
La liste est longue,
Tôt ou tard viendra le jour où sur cette terre on sera trop long lourd,
La liste est longue


Toujours un mal pour un bien, un être qui nous quitte
Et un autre qui vient au monde c'monde usé par les défauts de l'être humain.
On se demande comment on fera sans telle ou un tel,
Déjà trop de potes assommés par les lourdes peines ou one dead.
On regrette des actes des paroles malheureusement irrattrapables une fois aux funérailles
Cache nos douleurs parce qu'à la base on est des hommes,
Mais pire c'est qui y'a que les drames pour nous réunir.
Je peux pas m'empêcher de penser et parler
De ceux qui nous ont quitté tellement jeune
L.A.S, Mombi, Mamadou, Tchoul, Mohamed, Malek, Nouri,
Karim, Steven, Naser, Habib, Marc, qu' Allah nous préserve.
On cherche l'issue de secours, tente de traverser le désert
Juste à l'aide d'une gourde.
Cultive l'amour qu'on reçoit de nos proches
Ce qui nous aide à tenir le coup avant la fin du tunnel poto.

On fait monter les degrés Celsius
En vago j'cache ça dans le calcif
Les résidus radio actifs dans le lavabo
Ca irait si je buvais que de l'eau

Il m'reste encore un ou deux trophées une ou deux vestes Reebok
Sous perf de Maroco
Mais dans l'armoire cache pas de bédos d'White Widow ou 3 kil
Juste de quoi assumer si je me barre en vrille
J'suis pas ceinture noire d'Aikido
Mais j'ai de quoi t'faire un deuxième nombril
Ba, ba, j'gravite toujours autour de la rue, je connais que ça
Consomme comme un porc sans ordonnance du médecin
Ca m'inspire gros après m'avoir encouragé à ne plus m'instruire

J'ai la tête de l'inculpé, du coupable, du bouc émissaire
Même en étant môme, j'ai jamais rêvé d'être commissaire
Fuck la police, sors moi un bloc bien vi-ser

Fonce pété au volant pour effacer ce passé turbulent

Fuck la douane volante, dédié à ceux qui enfilent le collant
Fume la thai grasse collante. Aux potos partis d'une mort violente

J'ai un petit problème avec le rap
On a déjà des disques d'or
Gros lâche moi la grappe
Ca m'gêne d'voir des pédales aimer le son que j'aime
J'ai commencé sous Heineken
Je suis comme Eugène
La voix rauque, j'ai pas une voix de chienne comme Pharell
J'viens pas du rock, j'suis à l'ancienne
Un deux test, traumatise les sales parisiennes
J'rap comme je vendrais du shit
Toujours un penchant pour le risque
Il me reste du jus pour saigner les maisons de disque
Dans la rue ou dans le disque
A 2-10 avec l'équipe, avec les trips
En boîte sur la table fais-nous un strip
Même pas rasé dans les clips
Le rap c'était un trip étant gamin
Depuis, entre mecs qui y croyaient on a fait du chemin sans l'aide de personne
Dans l'rap à Vitry c'est pas ce qui manquait hein ?
Mais bon bref

J'ai un petit problème avec les femmes
Trop gentilles, trop connes ou trop de Rllam
Qui kiffent les voitures confortables, saturent ton portable
Veulent le cortège avant le mariage
N'ont pas le sens du partage
Je fais encore des gardes à vue
Et vu que je bédave, ça leur plait pas trop
Tempérament de patron
S'il te plait ne m'en demande pas trop, c'est pas drôle
Ne me prive pas de sexe ou je me branle
Fallait pas faire la grande, hein ?!
Tu sais plus où aller (cut)  (cut) ou avoir la roue arrière voilée
Voyons c'est qui le voyou, c'est toi ou moi ?!
Je connais trop de meufs égarées
Trop de salopards aussi qui après avoir tiré leur coup ne pensent qu'à se barrer

J'ai un problème avec tellement de choses
De quoi se faire de cheveux gris, devenir chauve
Beaucoup trop pour un seul homme
C'est pas pour rien qu'on me surnomme Tonton La Découpe

J'ai un problème, un gros problème
J'ai un gros problème avec la France en manque de franchise à mon égard
Ses brigades, ses regards, ses cars de CRS, fourgons cellulaires
Triquard comme un imposteur
Pourtant je suis dans la chambre de plein de jeunes français en poster
Et en CD avec un malien et un antillais
Dans les rues de notre ville, on roule pas en Roadster
On a notre méthode perso pour foutre la rage aux steurs
Toujours heureux comme un supporter de Manchester
Devant eux trop de vendus
Les baveux ça coûte chère, y'a trop de langues pendues
Rapports tendus, j'espère que je suis entendu
On n'est pas con on va au turbin comme on dit dans le jargon
Sans se faire pincer comme Alfred Sirven

Rim'k,"prends ces paroles comme si elles venaient de ton meilleur ami
certains courent apres le bonheur toute leur vie
et ne l'effleurent que de temps en temps

je ne compte plus les fois ou je l'ai echappe belle a des heures tardives
j'ai commence l'annee avec 3 parabellums braques en direction de mon pare - brise
en sursis a l'abri de rien, des longues marques sur un chemin perilleux
avec un parfum de violence, ca tient a rien
des menottes aux poignets ou un boule au pied
vulnerable jusqu'aux funerailles,
faut que tu l'acceptes comme la disparition de proches qui m'affecte
ou de voir mes neveux dans un ascenseur infect
tout jeune j'etais pas plus con qu'un autre
au milieu des autres a creer des liens impossibles a rompre
en bas des tours passifs, sur les traces des voyous qui nous fascinent
j'ai compris tout jeune que ca n'allait pas etre facile
je ne detestais pas l'ecole mais je ne voyais pas en elle une issue
trop de gens sur mon parcours scolaire m'ont decu, dechu, foutu d'apres les sondages
l'ete a la piscine municipale, toute l'annee avec un mental de sauvage
dans tous les coups a toi d'avoir l'imagination
assez large sans voir venir les soucis qui m'attendaient au virage
au tournant – d'innombrables – car chez nous le mal est palpable

refrain
sois conscient, combien d'epreuves au tournant
trop souvent, en silence ca nous tourmente

je suis curieux de savoir ou tout ca nous mene
au tournant, certains ne sont l'ombre que d'eux - memes
tu vois des potes sortir rentrer, les memes sortir rentrer,
une chance minime de se reinserer
les dents serrees, acerees devant la grisaille de nos batiments
le moral egratigne ca devient vite fatigant, captivant parfois, capture parfois
c'est plus complexe que ca, ce qui est difficile, c'est de durer
les regards froids une fois la majorite passee, voir les fourgons passer, repasser
au jour le jour vivre chaque minute avec compassion, les actions bonnes ou mauvaises
dure a mettre en application ce qu'on nous a appris et pour s'en echapper il y a un prix
faut - il le payer de nos vies ?
dure a comprendre donc dans la solitude, notre fortune est dans notre ame et celui - ci se consume
doucement a chaque epreuve qui nous attend – au tournant –

refrain

au tournant avec un brun de folie, avec ce qu'il faut sous le lit, insoumis
insomniaque on manque de tact
ca devient mauvais d'etre emotif
on a un parpaing au milieu des arteres
la rue t'emmene a commettre l'acte a ne pas faire
entre deux arrivages, deux orages
en attendant de courir dans la mauvaise direction
de tomber sur la mauvaise brigade, au virage et tellement peu bavards
meme au plus judicieux mais rien n'arrive au hasard
en embuscade meme tard la nuit
drogue douce, (whi)sky pour noyer les soucis sur les hauteurs de la ville
gamberger, on a l'age du meurtre
l'age ou on pense a se caser avec l'impression que c'etait hier qu'on se faisait bercer
nos parents s'inquietaient pour nous, maintenant les roles sont inverses
le temps presse, je pourrai me faire renverser
d'etre prier de me coucher a terre, d'etre encercler
c'est un cercle vicieux, un engrenage pour les coups de lame
et les larmes versees et les actes controverses
a dieu et ma famille, je dis merci d'etre encore la
chez nous dormir c'est perdre du temps
apres chaque nuit c'est tout ce qui t'attend

au tournant

je repense a ceux qui me manquent, au tournant

Mama, I guess you have stood and cursed 
The day I found that old guitar.
When uncle harry died, 
The one we found in the boot of his old car.
I remember how my little fingers blistered 
When I tried to learn to play,
I bet you never dreamed that old guitar 
Would put me where I am today.

Yes, it's been a lot of years, 
I guess it's been an interesting life.
No, mam, I never found another woman 
That I wanted for a wife.
I guess the first time showed us 
That I wasn't the domesticated kind,
But I don't blame her for getting tired 
Of living from a suitcase all the time.

Yes, I know sometimes it looks
Like I've just simply thrown my life away.
I just always figured that if I hung on,
I'd make it big some day.
I guess it takes a special breed
To live this life and think the way I do,
But you'll be glad to hear that any more
I ain't near as bad to drink.

How is Tommy doing with the business
Now that daddy's passed away?
I'm sure daddy always knew that tom
Would be the one to take his place.
And when he tried to lecture me,
I'd sit and pick and sing and let him nag,
But way down deep inside I think
He always knew that hardware ain't my bag.

We open Monday night in bolton city
For another two week stand,
I wish there was some way that you and tom
Could come and hear my band.
Wish I had the time to tell you 'bout the
Places that I've been, the things I saw.
And I'll send the fifteen dollars soon
As I get to the club and make a draw.

When you're hot, you're hot there
Ah, I mean, ah, when what is",$15 Draw
Ringo Starr,"I left Louisiana, I had me big plans
To go out and take me all over this land.
To see me the world, I left my sweet girl

And beau coups of blues.

Oh, sweet magnolia,
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf.
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough.

Oh, where are the things I saw in my dreams?
Where's the happy that freedom should bring?

That I threw away my most precious things.

That life is full of heartaches for a poor boy,
'cause a bank roll can turn his woman's head around.
Ain't no use to try and run away or move to another town,
'cause any where a poor boy goes there's a loser's lounge.

Had a real good friend named Sam,
Said he just couldn't understand
Why in the world his sweet love let him down.
But a rich man caught her eye,
He had the money for things to buy.

Down at the loser's lounge.

SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF SHE WOULD JUST STAY GONE.

Ringo Starr,"Patiently she stares down the runway,
Today's the day that he is coming home.
Seems like he's been gone a life time
And a life time is a long time to be gone.
But there are songs that need singing,
And there are things that must be done.
There are thoughts that still need thinking,
And there are wars that must be won.

He was just a boy when they sent for him
And overnight turned him into a man.
Proudly he had served his country
In a war he didn't seem to understand.
The flag still waves, his war is over,
He'll never have to kill again.
And as she waits, she thinks it over,
Is winning worth the prize we pay to win?

Her thoughts keep wandering to his childhood,
When all his hand grenades were merely toys.
And ""war"" was just a game that he was playing
With plastic guns like other little boys.
And ev'ry day when play was over,
He'd put his little toys away.
And she'd be standing, waiting for him,
The way she's waiting here today.

As the plane stops she starts thinking,
Will he still look the way he did before?
Or will his eyes reflect the pain of killing,
Like most young men when they come home from war?
These last few minutes seem like hours,
She tries her best not to cry.
But there's that hearse filled up with flowers,
Did he really have to die?

No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, no,

Eyes bloody red, face puffy white.
Hair tangled up and wrinkled old clothes,
I'm a living example of a big overdose of:

Wine, women and loud happy songs,
I had all three but none lasted long.
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimes.

It's strange how the wine works on a fool,
It seeps through his mind,
Leaves him glued to the stool.
Women leave you wishing you'd just never been
But the songs makes you happy,
Soon you're searching again for:

Wine, women and loud happy songs,
I had all three but none lasted long.
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimes.","Wine, Women and Loud Happy Songs"
Ringo Starr,"Softly I search my mem'rys
And hope I may find yesterday.
And just like her, my thoughts wander
And like her quietly slip away.
Love brings out the weakness in a man
And I'm so weak I just can't stand
To be without her,
Without her,
Without her.

There was a time she walked with me,
But yesterday comes only one time.
And I can see a tomorrow
With yesterday cling to my mind.
Time will take her memory they say,
But it gets harder ev'ry day,
To live without her,
Without her,
Without her.",Without Her
Ringo Starr,"Every night she's on the corner,
She's got her business in the street.
Her smile may make you think that you can own her,
But that smile's reserved for everyone she sees.

Woman of the night, I've heard them call her,
But she's still a woman when morning comes around.
She walks through the market as a lady
And she's kinda nice to have around.

She's a woman of the night and I love her,
Although' her love, my silver doesn't buy.
It's worth the rain to have a little sunshine
And you laugh much louder when you learn to cry.

I've seen them pay for her affection,
But when morning comes, no one calls her name.
She wakes to find no sign of appreciation,
Still she isn't wearing any shame.

BUT WHAT CAN I DO?
I'M A FOOL TO CARE.



",I'm a Fool to Care
Ringo Starr,"With someone like you
A pal so good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to God alone
Just a spot to call our own

We'll find perfect peace
Where joys never cease
Out there beneath the kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest
Somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

Ringo Starr,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Only you beneath the moon and under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter, darling, where you are, i think of you,
Night and day.

Day and night, why is it so,
That this longing for you follows wherever i go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room, i think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day, under the hide of me,
There's, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me.
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you,
Day and night, night and day.

Ringo Starr,"Gonna take a sentimental journey,
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey,
To renew old memories

I've got my bag and got my reservation,
Spent each dime I could afford.
Like a child in wild anticipation,
Long to hear that ""all aboard!""

Seven, (seven)
That's the time we leave,
At seven (seven)
I'll be waiting out for heaven, (heaven)

Why did I decide to roam?
Got to take this sentimental journey,

Ringo Starr,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Ringo Starr,"For you and me, babe, it's time that we part,
And between you, babe, I gave you my heart,
For these few moments,
I wish we could start at the top again.

For me and you, babe, it's the end of our date,
Me and the band, babe, all thought it was great,
To entertain you,
But it's getting late and it's time to leave.

Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine.
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine.
And when the sun sets in the sky
And you close your weary eyes,
I'll be in some night-club, getting high, that's no lie.

Now you and me, babe, we may meet again,
And in the meanwhile, stay out of the rain.
But keep your nose dry
And give as a smile if you liked the show.

Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine.
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine.
Though I may not be in your town,
You know that I can still be found
Right here on this record, spinning 'round, with the sounds.

For you and me, dave, they turned out the lights,
The violins stayed to wish you good night.
Me and the band-aid are reaching the end, so it's off we go.

Goodbye, everybody!
Come on, lads, play it for me, boys, there we are.

Richard Perry, who's producing this masterpiece, Bill Schnee, ever smiling, ever
loving, Vini Poncideo and all his other friends and everybody else who joined in and

And love so distant and obscure
