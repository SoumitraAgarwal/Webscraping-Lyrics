Rebecca Kilgore,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town, hm
 
It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town
Rebecca Kilgore,"Islands of Hawaii
Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight
Caress the waving palms of Wai KiKi

Valleys with their rainbows
Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Rebecca Kilgore,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Rebecca Kilgore,"All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time too
All I do the whole day thru, is dream of you
 
All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue

Rebecca Kilgore,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Rebecca Kilgore,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Rebecca Kilgore,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

A garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy",If You Were the Only Girl in the World
Rebecca Kilgore,"Yes, it's a good day for singin' a song,
And it's a good day for movin' along;
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong,
A good day from mornin' till night.

Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes,
And it's a good day for losin' the blues;
Ev'rything to gain and nothin' to lose,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.

I said to the sun, ""good mornin', sun.
Rise and shine, today""
You know you've gotta get goin'
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you know you've got the right of way

Cause it's a good day for payin' your bills;
And it's a good day for curin' your ills,
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills;
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.",It's a Good Day
Rebecca Kilgore,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Rebecca Kilgore,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around
Rebecca Kilgore,"I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this.

I might be smilin' by now 
With some new tender friend.
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend.

But when I try
Something in that heart says ""No"".
You're still there
I wish I didn't love you so.",I Wish I Didn't Love You So
Rebecca Kyler Downs,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me
Rebecca Lindsey,"Fat lip hands on your hips ready to quit
The world kicks you while your down
A sucker punch was too much not getting up
You just lay there on the ground

Cowboys never do it that way
When they fall they get back up in the saddle
They always own up to their mistakes
They never back down they fight their own battles
You could just forget it ride off alone and headed
Into the sunset at the end of the day
But cowboys never do it that way ay ay ay

You tell yourself try something else the hand that you’re dealt
You fold face down on the table
Just pretend that you win begin again baby
If you think you’re able

Cowboys never do it that way
When they fall they get back up in the saddle
They always own up to their mistakes
They never back down they fight their own battles

But cowboys never do it that way ay ay ay

Rebecca Lindsey,"I’m already in the saddle 
Sitting on goodbye 
Letting go of hanging on 
I’m leaving you behind 
You can keep this castle 
Where you’ve crowed yourself the king 
Go ahead and do it no, it doesn’t mean a thing 

You can cry me a river 
Enough tears to reach the sea 
They can flow on forever 
They’re almost moving me 
Let ’em fall, it’s too late 
You can cry me a river 
And I’ll just sail away 

You made every kind of promise 
Except the kind you keep 
And the only time you told the truth 
Was when you were asleep 
I’ve seen this act of yours 
From the beginning to the end 
I fell for it before but I won’t fall for it again

You can cry me a river 
Enough tears to reach the sea 
They can flow on forever 
They’re almost moving me 
Let ’em fall, it’s too late 
You can cry me a river 
And I’ll just sail away",Cry Me a River
Rebecca Lindsey,"I woke up this morning
Didn't look at your picture
Just watched the rain fall
And never once missed you
Didn't get my hopes up
When the telephone rang
I didn't think about you
When the mailman came

I'm getting over you
A little each day
Stopped sitting around
Just wasting away
I don't come home
Calling out your name
Girl you won't believe
How much I've changed
I'm strong enough now
To face the truth
I'm finally getting 
Over loving you
And quite going crazy and crying
I've stopped everything but lying

I had some old habits
I've gotten rid of
Like cigarettes and coffee
And thinking 'bout love
I'm just working on climbing
That very next hill
Closing my eyes
And convincing myself

I'm getting over you
A little each day
Stopped sitting around
Just wasting away
I don't come home
Calling out your name
Girl you won't believe
How much I've changed
I'm strong enough now
To face the truth
I'm finally getting 
Over loving you
And quite going crazy and crying
I've stopped everything but lying",Everything But Lying
Rebecca Lindsey,"Sittin' in this café, eleven forty five people walkin' by 
Sippin' on my coffee, this corner booth just waitin' on you 
Fifteen more minutes 
Is that all the time that I have left 

What should I say 
How can I make you see 
My heart is breakin' I can't take it 
Why, why did I let us go 
Here I am at the end of my rope 
Hangin' on hope 

I'm all tied up in knots, here you come, it's too late to run 
Stumblin' over my thoughts, how can I undo what I've done 
I was wrong, I admit it 
Now I've just got to find a way to say it 

What should I say 
How can I make you see 
My heart is breakin' I can't take it 
Why, why did I let us go 
Here I am at the end of my rope 
Hangin' on hope 

I miss the way you loved me 
The way you used to feel about me 
Baby could you please forgive me 
Do you think that you could ever love me again 

Why, why did I let us go 
Here I am at the end of my rope 
Hangin' on hope",Hanging on Hope
Rebecca Lindsey,"Both hands back on the wheel
It's been a while
Since I could really feel
A sense of control and I
Took the wrong way
A long way from where I am now
I'm not there yet
But I’m learning about how

Life goes by
At blurry blinding lightning speed I've
Spent so much time
Worryin' 'bout what's all around me
I'll steer my life between these two lanes
Off the brakes just drive straight
Following these
Headlights on the highway

No I will not look back
On these miles behind me
I will not be held down
By the chains that bind me
Keep rollin' goin'
With the choices I’ve made
Won't let fear slow me down
Or get in my way 'cause

Life goes by
At blurry blinding lightning speed I've
Spent so much time

Rebecca Lindsey,"Well this morning was the first time
That I woke up to the sunshine
Instead of lying in the silence of the dark
All the sadness hasn't left me
My glass is still half empty
I'm not at a place when I can trust my heart
But I will be, yes I will be

I will be that innocent believer
I will see forever in my dreams
There's still some healing left
I'm not over you quite yet
But this voice inside my head is tellin' me
That I will be

There's a few smiles in the mirror
And the sky's a little clearer
I'm not takin' my umbrella everywhere
And the pain that's slowly fading
Gives me hope a new life's waiting
And let's me know that even though 
I'm still not there, that I will be

I will be livin' for tomorrow
I will see yesterday is gone
There's still some healing left
I'm not over you quite yet
But this voice inside my head is tellin' me
That I will be

I wish that I could snap my fingers
And the past would vanish in a puff of smoke
Right now this heartache wants to linger
But I'm learning to forget
I'm starting to let go
And some day I know

I will be open to forgiveness
I will see the good in what we had
There's still some healing left
I haven't gotten there quite yet
But this voice inside my head is tellin' me
That I will be, yes I will be",I Will Be
Rebecca Lindsey,"While you were sleeping 
You looked so peaceful 
I quietly kissed your cheek 
Your steady breathing 
Said you were dreaming 
So I tiptoed out the door 
While you were sleeping 

I backed up the u-haul 
Couldn't quite get it all 
Just the dishes and the kids 
And the money that you hid 
That you thought I'd never find 
Quite as a church mouse 
'Till I slammed the door on our house 
To let you know that I was leaving 
While you were sleeping 

While you were sleeping I was needing 
You to just wake up 
And be a man 
But your lying, drinking, cheating
Breakin my heart ways 
Was more than I could stand 
But could I stand alone 
There's only one way to know 

I backed up the u-haul 
Couldn't quite get it all 
Just the dishes and the kids 
And the money that you hid 
That you thought I'd never find 
Quite as a church mouse 
'Till I slammed the door on our house 
To let you know that I was leaving 
While you were sleeping  

While you were sleeping I was driving 
Further than I'd ever had before 
And those babies in the 
Back seat reminding me 
Of what I'm driving for 
I wish I could've stayed 
But you wouldn't change",While You Were Sleeping
Rebecca Luker,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Rebecca Luker,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words

It came a-ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall

Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
Theres a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly and papers lie awaiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too

And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight, by jewel light if only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you wake up, it's a Chelsea morning?

",Chelsea Morning
Rebecca Lynn,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

Guess somehow deep down,I'm convinced

What I feel,can't be real
That's what I tell myself
It's a dream,this kind of thing
Only happens to someone else
I don't want to believe you're gone
Some things are true
Believe it or not

I still leave the light on
On the chance you'll drop by
I still park on my side of the drive

How it feels being loved by you

Nothing's ever left me speechless like you do

There's so much that I would like to say
And I think I've found a way

Listen to my heart sounds (oh ah)
Every time that it pounds,I hear (oh la la)
I just can't hide the way I feel inside,no way (hey yeah)
'Cause whenever you're around (oh whoa)
It won't settle down (Mmm)
Listen  can't you hear it calling your name

You make emotions come ove me
That take a heart to express
Oh and if you listen carefully
You'll hear the message beating in my chest
So I guess what I'm confessing
Is there's no one who moves me like you do
If you ever doubt it's true

Listen to my heart sounds (oh ah)
Every time that it pounds,I hear (oh la la)

In the light of truth
It wasn't you,it was me

Against the wall
Who'd of thought,it was me
From there I couldn't even look over my shoulder
I kicked down all the walls and started all over

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay
I threw my brushes away
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

When you left you left me with no other choice at all
But to sink
To my knees,and cry
I never knew just how far a soul could fall
Like a rock
I couldn't stop,didn't try
I locked myself behind shades of misery
But when I let you go,I set myself free

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay

Rebecca Lynn Howard,"In the back of my mind there's a sweet memory
Of an old front porch swing and daddy singing to me
I can still feel the touch of his callused hands
In my eyes he was the one perfect man
The first of three men I gave my hear to
Jesus,Daddy and you

Come Sunday morning I knew where I'd be
Between Momma and Daddy pew number three
Where I  put my life in two nail scarred hands
The day that I fell for one more perfect man
The men I have loved had been mighty few
Jesus,Daddy and you

There are three kinds of love that everyone needs
I knew that something was missing for me

Then you came along and completed my life
I saw Jesus and Daddy in yourr loving eyes
I looked up when you put the ring on my hand
And I thanked God for one more perfect man
Three men in my life whose love has been true
Jesus,Daddy and you

Three men in my life I gave my heart to
Jesus,Daddy and you","Jesus, Daddy and You"
Rebecca Lynn Howard,"Ever since I lost you babe
I've been here and there
Looking for some piece of mind, can't find it anywhere
I went to Tunica, played me a little blackjack
Saw a wino on the corner gave my winnings back

[Chorus]
If it was just money
Baby, I could make it
But living without you
Can I take it
All I see ahead of me 
Is just melancholy blue
Cause I ain't got no future without you

I went to Austin, lots of beautiful people there
Could have had a better adventure, I just didn't care
Got a job in California, they sure liked my style
But there's something about that California sun
Reminds me of your smile

[Chorus]

Now and then I go back to Biloxi
Whenever I feel brave
Visit that little country church down there
Lay some flowers on your grave
You sure got a hold on me, I don't know what to do
I ain't got no future
I can't see no future without you",Melancholy Blue
Rebecca Lynn Howard,"Another same old same old Friday night
What a surprise dinner and a movie
Gotta believe there's more to life
I'm looking for a man,looking for a man
Looking for a man to move me

I want to go swimming in an icy creek
Make sand angels on the beach
Shoot cans with a BB gun
Go hang gliding and bunjee jump
Swing around on the monkey bars
Come on guys it ain't all that hard
I'm stuck in a dull routine
Lookin' for a man to move me

If you want to get to me
Just give my world a spin
I'm not that hard to please
Take my heart somewhere it's never been
I want to steal a kiss at the top of the ferris wheel
Count the stars while we're lying in a grassy field
Eat blackberries off the vine
Make mud pies and fly a kite
Catch fireflies in a mason jar
Come on guys it ain't all that hard
I'm stuck in a dull routine
Looking for a man to move me

I'll wade out up to my waist
Been standin' on the bank all day hot and sweaty
We can't let this one get away
Take your time, let the line sink it the bottom
'Cause we sure don't want it to break
But if the fish stop bitin' and it gets hotter
It sure feels good out here in the water

[Chorus]
Baby just come on and jump in here with me
You can leave your clothes on or underneath that tree
It's a whole lot cooler, I really think you oughta
It sure feels good, feels real good out here in the water

Just tie him off to the hitch on the bumper
Let that bad boy fight himself
If he gets loose then we'll hook another
But while we've got a little daylight left
Forget the fish, we can dish all of our troubles
Right here in this lake 
It gets deeper out a bit farther
It sure feels good out here in the water

[Chorus]",Out Here in the Water
Rebecca Lynn Howard,"The night is filled with questions
The darkness takes its toll
Why did we take love for granted?
How could we lose control?

And I wonder as I lie here
Not knowing where you are
Was it as hard to be together
As it is to be apart?

Was goodbye the answer?
I'm not sure anymore
I just might trade the way it is
For the way it was before

And I still can't help but wonder
Is it as lonesome where you are
Was it as hard to be together
As it is to be apart?

It hurt too much to just keep holding on
But I know I've never spent a night this long
And I swear it seems that letting go
May leave a deeper scar

Was it as hard to be together
As it is to be apart?

Well it hurt too much to just keep holding on

And Ill get up on the roof and dance

I'll find the perfect guy
Whose heart beats just like mine
And his great ambition will be me

But his hands were shakin' like a willow leaf
Reaching out for one more drink
He didn't look like a loser to me
But he was lost behind his tears
Something had to drive him there
He don't fit in with this crowd
Somewhere, sometime he was proud

There's a storm stretched out
A million miles across his heart
And a war he's fighting
In the dark
Whatever it is, something bigger than him
Drove him too far down to crawl
But it didn't look like alcohol

Thought I heard him say somebody's name
But I just pretended like I didn't hear
I just wished that I could disappear
He was crackling like a desert of burning shame
Pleading with someone that I couldn't see
He might as well've been on his knees
Like a bomb tickin' ready to blow

Once upon a lonely time
I could barely make it though the night
It always seemed the sky was falling
Down on me
But life's funny you don't own it
Things can change in a single moment
That's what happened to me

Every time a promise fell through
Every time my heart broke in two
And it was always too dark to see the horizon
When I thought I had it right in my hand
It would slip right through like sand
I didn't know why but now I see
That life had other plans for me

I was doing my best,giving my all
Kept hittin' my head up against the wall
Missin' the mark when I thought my
Aim was true
I didn't know just what it meant
But now I see that it was heaven sent
'Cause that's when I met you

To the single mom trying to pay the rent

Taped back together and then they tossed me

Some people worship the color green

In some old woman's hope chest

How she used to spend me
On a pack of gum, and jackerjacks
A can of Coke and a quarter snack
And she'll say ""back then you could get so much for a dollar""
And they'll say, ""what's a dollar?""

But for now I'm sitting in a piggybank
Of an eight year old trying to buy a bike
I'm proud to be a dollar twenty three

Counts us all then holds us tight
Then she puts us back in one by one
Blows a kiss then she says good night

To put a new twist on an old groove

[Chorus:]
When we feel uptight
We don't wait long
If the music ain't right
We get a new song
When love ain't heatin' us up
We think of something cool
To put a new twist on an old groove

They say love is forever
Made to last
But every now and then
It needs a kick in the ass

[Chorus:]

To put a new twist on an old groove
To put a new twist on an old groove
Baby I love when you do that thing
Put a new twist on an old groove
To put a new twist on an old groove",New Twist on an Old Groove
Rebecca Lynn Howard,"We were young, moved way too fast
Soon the future was the past
Now here we are
Wondering who we are

Blame lust, blame it on fate
Blame it on we just couldn't wait
To feel the fire burning in our hearts

It ain't love, if it ain't real love
It ain't worth holding in this pain
When we're both about to burst
I think its time 
We take a long hard look at us
'Cause it ain't love, if it ain't real love

We should try to shine a light
On the truth, what's wrong and right
That's the only way to get beyond the anger
Can't play love like it's a game
Say my touch ain't quite the same
And when I'm holding you 
It's like I've held a stranger

Oh but hope may be the best for both of us
'Cause it ain't love, if it ain't real love

Rebecca Lynn Howard,"Across the street from Mable's store
Underneath my daddy's carport
If you knew at least three chords
You could come and play all night long
Flattop, mandolin or anything with strings
Every single Saturday you could hear us sing

[Chorus:]
High and low, rough and sweet
And if you couldn't play you brought something to eat
Folks would come from miles around
It gets in your blood and you can't get it out
When it steals your heart there ain't nothing you can do
There wasn't no money
You just sing 'cause you loved to

Daddy would sing 'Ring of Fire'
Someone would play the 'Wildwood Flower'
Fiddles moaning in the wee small hours
And you couldn't make the people go home
I'd sit in Momma's lap and she'd rock me to sleep
To 'Amazing Grace' in three part harmony

[Chorus:]

I carry in my soul the music from my younger days
And I try to remember every time I hit the stage
High and low

It gets in your blood 
And you can't get it out

Rebecca Lynn Howard,"I was raised in the hills of Kentucky
I grew up in L.A.
From different sides of the country
Every time we heard music play

We were learning our language
We were born to speak
We may not sing it the same way
But I hear what you're saying to me

[Chorus:]
Hey, hey
We're soul sisters
And roots run deep
We're soul sisters
Laying it down
And we're praying the soul to keep

Lord it took my breath away
When I heard a bottle neck slide
I felt blues in that bluegrass
That could not be denied
Here's to the peers and the pioneers
Who paved the way
And passed it down to you and me
This musical DNA

I want to hear you scream 
I want to see you smile
Want to give you everything you came here for

A rockin' time and a banging band

Get up, get your feet on to the floor

Are you ready to throw it down
Live it up it ain't a party now
Ain't got no time to messin' around
Got to get down to business now
You're a rowdy crowd
Do you like it loud
Are you ready to throw it down

Hey you back there
It's like you're so far
Come a little closer to my guitar

We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine

Don't you look at me that way
Don't tell me you want to stay

Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

Safe from what's inside

What are the questions for?
When love has come to me before
What makes yours unique?

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Rebecca Parris,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Rebecca St. James,"God asks the question, ""Whom shall I send?""
Now what will we answer? Will we go and do as he says?
All that he wants is a heart, ready, willing and waiting

Here I am
I will do as you say I will go where you send
Here I am

When I am weakest then I know your power
You are the light that shines in me

I walk along this winding road
Too many voices tell me which way to go
Sometimes this heart gets so confused
I need you Lord to show me
Which path to choose
And I'm longing for that place way up high
Where God's air is sweet and I touch the sky

Way up here I can see the far horizon
All the world before my eyes is clear to see
Way up here where my Father always meets me
On this mountain where he heals me I can rest
Way up here

Rising above this life we know
Leaving the streams of sorrow far down below
I feel the touch of God's loving hand
Restoring me in ways I can't understand
If I fall away his love reaches me
And he brings me back
To the edge of my dreams

Way up here I can see the far horizon
All the world before my eyes is clear to see
Way up here where my Father always meets me
On this mountain where he heals me I can rest
Way up here

No matter where we travel, no need to fear the shadows
My God is there
His light is there to follow
Back to the quiet waters
I know he cares

Way up here I can see the far horizon
All the world before my eyes is clear to see
Way up here where my Father always meets me
On this mountain where he heals me I can rest
Way up here

You can have the money, wheel it, deel it, win it all
You can have a lot of fashion, you can even own the mall
You can change your face into the person of your dreams
Trim your nose and dye your hair and change your eyes from blue to green
You can be a model cover every magazine
You can walk on every stage or be the host of M.T.V
You can win the medals, run it, swim it, perfectly
You could have a turn at Indy, you could even own the team

We're never gonna see God if we keep looking for vogue
We could gain the whole world but still be losing our soul
We don't need it, 'cause God has given us our needs
We don't want it, shouldn't he be our priority
We don't need it, Jesus said to leave it all behind
Let's keep our eyes on things above
'cause we don't need to want to need it

You can get a job on Wall Street have more money than you've seen
You can buy administrations and you can even own the queen
You can own a castle oily paintings on the wall
Build a suite for every pleasure, have a disco host a ball
Drive a lamburguini, fast as time and painted red
Leather phone and matching fax and color T.V.s overhead
Take your yacht to Rio, fly your jet up to Cancun
Screamin' down the highway like a rocket to the moon

We're never gonna see God if we keep lookin' for vogue
We could gain the whole world but still be losing our soul
We don't need it 'cause God has given us our needs
We don't want shouldn't he be our priority
We don't need it Jesus said to leave it all behind

Yesterday, mid-afternoon
My thoughts kept turning back to You
From the sky stretched into space
To the sunshine on my face

Hey, I cannot explain
I see You in it all
I hear You call my name

Rebecca St. James,"On the corner of Fifth and Broadway
I was walking to the grocery store on Third
I saw a man up on a box
He seemed a bit unorthodox
He was preaching up a storm
As I passed on by he said

Don't worry about your life
Cause if you hold it too close, you'll lose it
Don't worry about your life
So won't you let go before it's gone

A little further on I saw a beggar on the street
He asked for change and then gives me his life story
Says he was a millionaire, made some bad decisions there
Now a dollar fifty would
Feed him for a week and he said

Don't worry about your life
Cause if you hold it too close you lose it
Don't worry about your life
So won't you let go
Before it's gone

Then I see the birds, I watch them fly
They've got everything they need
They show me why I can be free
Knowing You will care for me

Finally at the grocery store
My mind is filled with many thoughts
As I bump into a girl I knew from high school
She said, what's different about you girl?
And I smiled and said this is what I know is true
And I pass it right along to you

Don't worry about your life
Cause if you hold it too close you lose it
Don't worry about your life
So won't you let go before it's gone",Don't Worry
Rebecca St. James,"If I could speak with tongues of angels
If I could write the future in the sky
If I could know the wisdom of the ages
But have no love what would it mean

For the love of God
Let this be my motivation
For the love of God
In this love I'm recreated
For the love of God
It's the reason for giving love away
For the love of God

If I have faith, faith to move a mountain
If I give all I own to the poor
If I surrender my body to the flames
But have no love I have nothing

When I'm gone let it be said
That I loved You more than anything
While I'm here let all men see
Your love in me",For the Love of God
Rebecca St. James,"You said the words
And made the heavens
You breathed the stars
And put their place in the sky
You waved Your hand
Painted a sunset
You smiled and gave a heartbeat life

Crazy to think
That Your holy hands
Made everything I see
It's so hard to believe
That You the God of creation say
I've got this power in me

In me
There is strength to move a mountain
In me
There is faith to walk on water
In me
If I just believe
The Way and the Truth and the Life is
In me

So please remind me
When I feel useless
That my flesh and bone
Has more than meets the eye
Because you burn
Like a fire was in me
And there's nothing out of reach when I
Let your Spirit loose and be alive

In me
There is strength to move a mountain
In me
There is faith to walk on water
In me
If I just believe
The Way and the Truth and the Life is
In me


(You said the words
And made the heavens
You breathed the stars
And put their place in the sky
You waved Your hand
Painted a sunset
You smiled and gave a heartbeat life)

You set the world in motion
Put the waves in the ocean
And when it all comes down
I've got to believe
That You the God of creation say
I've got this power

In me
There is strength to move a mountain
In me
There is faith to walk on water
In me
There is strength to move a mountain
In me
There is faith to walk on water
In me
If I just believe
The Way and the Truth and the Life is
Oh, The Way and the Truth and the Life is

And he swears he won't hit her no more
And yeah she's heard all this before
But she still needs to make believe it's love
And I mind my business across the street
Turn up my music and try to sleep
But I wish she'd reach out to me
So I could help her see

He wears her in
He wears her out
And I just wanna fill her in
That's not what love's about

So he goes and buys her pretty things
'Cause he doesn't know how else to be
And I wonder why won't she leave
I guess nobody wants to be alone
And I see her in the store one day
Her sunglasses hide the love they made
But this time I don't turn away
I ask her does she know

He wears her in
He wears her out
And I just wanna fill her in
That's not what love's about

She closes in
To keep him out
And I just wanna fill her in

To fill me.

Let's live on dreams...
In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me.

Ending?
Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold...but
My dreams?
Oh is it only in dreams that we find out ideal love?
Are there lovers with real love? 

If you know how to feel love, show me how.
Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem, 
I'd rather dream!
Come and wake me! Come be the love I can hold now.

I'll be waiting for the day she'll come knockin' on my door
My eyes have always seen together you and I
Will be living life with no regretting
Perfect harmony

Slowly you and I will love
Will always be together
The only one that I could love
Our love should last forever

Put to the stake by royal hands

And so in flames their life did end

At the Althing he had put them dead
A royal smile a lie on the lips
Believe in Christ or drink burning lead

He was taken at night and tried to a stake
His house on flames
Yet he would not fold his hands
Condemned to death
He had to swallow a snake

The more you make the more the gap expands,
The more you give the more the love you land,
The more you take the more we suffer man,
But he'll spend most of it on what he sees,
Maybe buy something he may never need,
See now this is the mentality,
Wake up call this is reality

I said the three words that some people dread

Eight times for me and eight times for the sake
Eight times for love and eight times for the way

See you in the spring when the patience pays
I'm strugglin' but hustlin' and lovin' it, always.

Yeah yeah

I wrote to her eighty-five times
Sometimes for her, but sometimes for my
Simple collection of lies
Sometimes to find the way up in a rhyme
I woke up one morning to find
It was her first name on a billboard sign
I smiled and said damn what a trip
I was just yesterday I had a kiss for her lips
Usually I don't make much of this
A sign's a sign it doesn't change it a bit
I choose to stay calm in my sleep

That was then, I was down to a week
Longest seven days of my life so to speak
I sip up my tea so sweet
And my head thirsts the girl I've been dying to see

So completely

Waiting for your second skin to settle in

And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down

He was as burned out as a building from the riots
He had a rockin' little girlfriend named Marla
She was a cocktail waitress at The Pit

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd ride jet skis
And they'd take his little trailer to the river
They'd bring along a T.V. to watch Rick Dees
Well, they smoked dope and snorted crystal meth

Marla was as skinny as a fence post
And the powder in the baggie made her talk
Sometimes she did her hair like Charlie's Angels
Yeah, well, sometimes she looked as weird as Mr. Spock

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd eat fast food
And they'd take his El Camino to the desert
They'd ride his motorcycles in the sand dunes
Well, they smoked dope and snorted crystal meth

Tommy had a passion for firearms
His confidence, they really seemed to bolster
He bought a ninety dollar pistol for his Mar-Mar
She kept it in her little girlie holster

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd be fighting
As Tommy thought his girl was telling lies
He thought that she was thumpin' with the bass player
Smoking all his dope and all his crystal meth

Tommy started suffering from delusions
After five nights without any sleep
He rammed his fist through Marla's bedroom window
He shoved his car keys through her dirty little teeth

But Marla got her fingers on the trigger
She grabbed her little Tommy by the hair
The pistol was still smoking on the counter
The sirens were screaming through the air
Scream on and on

Tommy was a hesher from the valley
He's just a memory of his burned out little world
Marla's doing thirty years for murder
Yeah, but she knows she's still his rockin' little girl

They'll scrawl their names upon the Golden Wall
And maybe, up in Heaven, they'll watch Rick Dees
Smoke a little dope and snort some crystal meth

I ain't goin' back to jail

Sadie got a hideout
Off of 71
We'll count up all the money
Ditch the car and the guns
Sadie says she loves me
I'll always be her man,
""And I'll see you in Rio honey
We gotta stick to the plan""

I woke up in the hayloft
To the rooster's crow
No sign of Sadie
No sign of the dough
I'm heading to the airport
I got a little brass key
I got a ticket and a passport
Locker 32-B

Open up the blue box
There ain't nothing inside
I been played like a fiddle
I've been taken for a ride
Sadie made a phone call
In the middle of the night
They've got the place surrounded
With the black and white

I got myself a hostage
In a Delta skirt
""Do as I tell you
And nobody gets hurt
Show me where your car's parked
You're gonna have to drive
Because I'll be hiding in the backseat
With a .45""

""Get me through the roadblock
Better drive real slow
Better play your cards right
And I'll let you go""
And I hear my heart a pounding
As fast as it can
I hear the copper askin'
""Have you seen this man?""

Delta kept her mouth shut
Like a good girl should
""And you're free to go now
'cause you done real good""

Now I got a suitcase
And a thumb in the air
I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't really care

Bubba's got a big rig
And an empty seat
We're headin' to Laredo
It's alright with me

I'll check into a hotel
In old Mexico
I gotta wait until it cools down
I'm gonna lay a little low

Well I don't miss the money
I don't miss the guns
Well I sure miss Sadie
Even after all she's done

Yea, Sadie left me hanging
And she told a lotta lies
Well it's true what they say boys
True love never dies

Reckless Kelly,"So your baby's got the whole town talking
and they say you better open your eyes
And you act as if you never saw it coming
even though you got some good advice
And you've never been an angel yourself
but now you're gonna know how it feels

So quit your cryin' like your sad life's over
you were never really head over heels
But you wouldn't know love if you lost it
Even though you regret the goodbye
But you let your heart lead you blind in to love
When you trusted a wandering eye

Poor little baby got your heart half broken
and now it's time to overreact
Making a scene like you're filming a western
and the dialogue is action packed
It's probably better that you got it all out
and now it's high time to move on
Cause you knew deep inside when you looked in those eyes
there was really always something wrong

But you wouldn't know love if you lost it
Even though you regret the goodbye
But you let your heart lead you blind in to love
When you trusted a wandering eye

You're like the field mouse standing by the river
staring at the other side
Up swam your baby like an old alligator
said hop on kid I'll give you a ride
And even though you heard a whole lot of promises
you never saw the other shore
Hey but only a fool would have believed the alligator
and you knew it when you climbed on board

But you wouldn't know love if you lost it
Even though you regret the goodbye
But you let your heart lead you blind in to love
When you trusted a wandering eye

You had stone cold love and you lost it
Even though you regret the goodbye
But you let your heart lead you blind in to love
When you trusted a wandering eye",Wandering Eye

Who are madmen, who is sane?

Red Callender,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Ma lui ti ha aperto la portiera e ti ha baciata e gli hai sorriso

Forever telling you I though it over and over and over again

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [x4]

Gonna end up in a hole
Now you got me moving
Now I've got a taste
You can't stop me smiling
I'm laughing in your face

It's true
You're gonna end up in a hole
You never finish what you started
Forever telling you I though it over and over and over again

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [x4]

Gonna end up in a hole
Laugh about me all you like
Talk behind me, I don't mind
Let me tell you I'm alright

Gonna end up in a hole (whoa-oa-oa)
Laugh about me all you like (whoa-oa-oa)
Talk behind me, I don't mind (whoa-oa-oa)
Let me tell you I'm alright!

Thought it over, over and over
Thought it over, over again
[x2]

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [x8]

Gonna end up in a hole
You're gonna end up in a hole
You never finish what you started
Don't mind me telling you I though it over and over and over again

Red Delicious,"I lost myself again
I don't know who I am
I don't know where you are
I must've gone too far
And I'm too tired to try and find my way back home now

All my love has crumbled into dust
I don't know what will become of us

I think I cry because 
Of how easy it once was
That's how love should be
Why is it hard for me?
Why do I look at you and see a stranger there now?

All my love has crumbled into dust
I don't know what will become of us

Too much afraid to kill it though it's dying
I know the truth, but I'll continue lying to you

All my love has crumbled into dust
I don't know what will become of us

I lost myself again
I don't know who I am
I don't know where you are",Dust
Red Delicious,"There is madness
In the tremor beneath my skin
In the sweat running down my back 
In the breath that I'm holding in
While I tense for the next attack

I try to ride it out, but its taking its toll
I try to hide from it, but it knows where to go
I try to fight it, but it scares me so

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me

There is something
That I can't put my finger on
At the edge of my consciousness

And it stays with me dusk till dawn
What it is I can only guess

How can I beat it down, when I can't fight what I can't see?
I have to kill it before it kills me
I have to find out how strong I can be

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me

Honey, baby, it's not so bad
Easy to say when you've never had
This hanging over your head

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me
(Driving you away, away, away,)

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me

The fear is solid, the fear is real",Fear
Red Delicious,"Under an early sun, I hear a song, a desperate sound
Out of the open sky, an angel falling to the ground
Familiar to me-I feel a sickening sense of déjà vu
It used to be the song I'd sing

Until you touched me with your hands
And you showed me your sweet face

I was a ghost before, a silent heart, unoccupied
Uncomfortable in my skin, a clumsy shell where I would hide
I barely cared to breathe; I didn't have a reason to
Now when I do, I breathe for you

Because you touched me with your hands
And you showed me your sweet face
And you changed me with your truth
And you saved me with your grace

I feel resurrected, I feel born again in perfect skin
What did I feel before you opened up and let me in?
I can't recall, anything at all

Until you touched me with your hands
And you showed me your sweet face
And you changed me with your truth
And you saved me with your grace",Grace
Red Delicious,"I want you starstruck, stuck knee deep
I want you seasick every time you look at me
I want you spellbound falling at my feet
I want you heavy and I want you sweet
But what this is dissolves 'ere long
It turns into another song
But it's sweet
I want them awestruck, dumb with disbelief
I want them swooning every time they look at me
I want them pleading begging on their knees
To kiss their children and cure their disease
But what I crave so badly now
Will soon go bitter in my mouth
But it's sweet
I want their worship and their stares
If it goes sour well who cares
It's sweet
I want you starstruck, stuck knee deep
I want you seasick everytime- you look at me
I want you spellbound falling at my feet
I want you heavy and I want you -sweet
I want you with me constantly
I cannot get you close enough to me
I smolder, silent until we meet
I want you heavy and I want you sweet
I want them struck with disbelief
I want them swooning everytime- they look at me

Is this who you want to be?
Have you got enough?
It makes no difference to me
I won't be happy, dear
Until you disappear

Why don't you just go away?
Come on now, it would make my day
Blow me a kiss and get on that train
And I'll never see you again

Everybody says
You're the one they want to touch
But they don't know me yet
So it doesn't mean all that much
They get a load of me, and you'll be history

Why don't you just go away?
Come on now, it would make my day
Blow me a kiss and get on that train
And I'll never see you again

Why don't you call it a day?
Pack it all up and throw it away
Wave goodbye and get in that car
So I can forget who you are

Too long I've waited in your shadow
Waiting for you to be over
I've started to hate you
Its making me wicked
So you've got to go now, go now, go

Nothing good can last, everything must end someday
Your work here is done; you've said all you have to say

Why don't you just go away?
Come on now, it would make my day
Blow me a kiss and get on that train

Giving you what you hadn't planned

I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

You'd better get out of there fast

We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

Red Foley,"When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep

And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right
But they all go native on Saturday Night
Oh, well the music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples looking for romance
Somebody takes a brogan and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on Saturday night
When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellow packs a gun
Everybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight

And she broke this heart of mine

How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss, I gave to you
(Made me a slave to you)
I'll never be free

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart

Red Garland,"Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

Tragedy just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start
You took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow, make a vow
No more to love's line will I bow
I cross my heart and feel it now
This is my last affair",My Last Affair
Red Garland,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Red Garland,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone
Red Garland,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how

Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day

Red Garland,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Red Garland,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed

The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew

Red Garland,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Red Garland,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Red Grammer,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Make you wonder somehow
How we did it before.

I wouldn't make it through another day,
I couldn't live without you.

Going back to how it used to be,
You've affected my reality,
And I need you like the air I breathe.
I can't go back,
Don't you know you hooked me up like that,
It'll hit me a heart attack,
If you ever should leave.

Lost inside your eyes,
Wondering how can I
Ever live without you,
Live without you beside my side.",Without You

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan

Let the beauty of the beat pump your pretty wet mound

Just drop your knees and come unbound

When they slither and slide on under your hood

Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good

I take to rubbin' her on the bum

The need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling
I got from you
The things I said to you were true

She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she's gone yes she's gone away

Turn feelings into words

Free spirits but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents we got together
And wrote on desks and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
And slipped through whatever cracks we can find minds altered 
We didn't falter in portraying hysterical and tragic characters
In a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city 
And the journeys away from it 
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spiral 
Leaving trail of irretrievable vital life juice behind
Still the brothers blood comrades partner family cuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental 'till death was upon us 
In our face mortality and lots of things seemed futile then 
But love and music can save us and did
While the giant grey monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us 
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side lovers living on the west end
Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings, I know your going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute I'm passing out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shocking
Than anything I ever knew
How about you?
Ten more reasons
Why I need somebody new just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for

Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Coming from space
To teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

Who fainted when she tucked you in 
Let's float away like zeppelins 
On stoic gusts of northern wind

Cry me a future 
Where the revelations run amok 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

Out on the farm we'll be 
Swimming with the mother duck 
Deep in the mitten where 
Lions and tigers come running 
Just to steal your luck 

Life is my friend 
Underwater violins 
Order now from ho chi min 
A porcelain that comes in twins 

Throw me in the looney bin 
'Cause I can take it on the chin (when I'm in Michigan)
The cleavage of your pillow skin 
Is moving like a violin

Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?

No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue

Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it

Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute

Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed

I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty chitty, baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas city
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?

Take my words and turn them into sounds

Just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme
You are the rise

It's your goodbye

You know I'm almost gone

He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

To ferry me away
To where we all belong

She recognized
Because you gave her a life of real love
It's no surprise

The night's are long, but the years are short
When you're alive
Way back when we'll never be again
It was a time
It's gonna catch you so glad I met you

Damn, I never shoulda hit you
They call me ""Chocolate Lover"" 10 inches of terror lovin'
I pull out my jimmy and bitches be like ""You buggin', you buggin'""

Said my name was ""Tone"" but you still sayin' ""Oh Jesus""

How I could hit the skins and wash my balls in your sink
I'm into freaky shit like women that inflate
My dick is insured 'cause I fucked in ""All-States""
I'll take a blind date, and she's a fine mate
Pull out a condom, so she don't complain that ""I'm late""
I'll be your ""Almond Joy"" if you feel like a nut
Mirros all around so I could watch my ass go up
And down and up and down, with sound
Ladies wet their panties whenever Red Hot's around
So come kiss the mister, it's the drifter
Who licks ya from your ass to your toe-jam, sister
When I'm erectness, check this
Let me cum on your neck and make a pearl sperm necklace
I'll lick your body if it's ashy, I'm nasty, ain't nothing to it

Behind them December's dark early morning sky

And a couple of dead trees
With their ornamental stars

Until now I thought I figured your body out
So please help me to understand
Because I love you more than anyone

You're chasing dragonflies at play

View of rain clouds from the window
Moving behind the pale of her face
A thousand circus mirrors cannot move a frown

And when it does, and when it does
And when it does, and when it does

There with you I fear the time, when air gets dark
You know I don't spend days like this
Caught up in lost times of youth that I miss

Can almost hear roller coasters, see sailboats in the sea
Hear noise and screaming
Weaving in and out of happy music box sounds
But here on the ground we're so far away from that
Time turned older now

We walked down the hill, I feel the coming on of the fading sun
And I know for sure that you'll never be the one
It's the forbidden moment that we live that fires our sad escape
And holds passion more than words can say

Tell me why are you like this? Are you the same with anyone?
Save me from my sickness and tell me why do you treat me like this?

You will be
Somewhere in London
Living with someone
You've got some kind of family
There to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you

A chance for calm
A hope for freedom
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
By the forest of our spring stay

Who else's hands have touched
Who I best understand
Held close the neck and waist
Of my adult orphan

This summer ends, the evenings we spent
Life under China dinner din
Wishes best to mystery address
I found deep in your occult key chest

On my suicide cloud
Left me in the pit of my morning pout

Your house with a view of purity
Overlooks a hillside of green, green as your eyes

And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me
?Cause a picture is all you are to me

At the twilight's last gleaming

An awful feeling of loss and of loneliness
The after late night television pain

I'm running out of strength
I'm running, running, running out of strength
And it feels so wonderful to swim in our fears
And divide inseparable, the awakening of life

Oh, Uncle Joe
Could you tell me about what you know?
Of being having mental problems
And their solutions too

I'll give anything a try once
I'll try anything three times
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care

But there's no company
That can stand to be with me
So my dependency on you grows
And I am not very well read

And consider I will lose my heart
And can you spare me of my pain?
Can't you spare me of my tears?

Oh, Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe

And suicide's intentional when I spin in your fear
I am over-influenced by movies
And you should've gone to the fear
To my hope, the darkest hope

That's all gone to the fear
To my hope, the darkest hope
Do you know? Lies become the sky

And the cool dark air cover me in my nearing bed
Where angels, men and mothers
Get to spend their Sundays and holidays
Where curtains hide the ugly scenes inside

Where the sun don't beat

Hover rooftops above
Light shine down into the tides
Over hillsides
See where the bridge and mountian meet
At the mouth of the sea
And where the sailboats live a day
And turn away
With the purple evening

Losing our loving hold
In the skies flourescent glow

Into the moonlit alley stairs
Still in my hand I feel the sting
The sound of bells ring
And the memory of the face
Never washes away
The current evening

And blue water turns to
A place that I can't get to
A place that I can't

Is the cold that you left

Through the air all I see
Is your face full of blame

Went for a swim in lover's beach
And there I met friends and I neared the bay
Until I felt sick

But you were my friend
Don't you know how I needed you then
I felt nervous when you shook and cried
The circles under your eyes
Made love till you reached the clouds
Through the ceilings and walls that surround

One time you drove through heat and hard rain
Three hundred miles in the roots of your pain
Things get so far back in your mind
That we don't connect

Avoiding strain that's running still alive

Since kicking in the womb
I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked

Like birthdays and old friends
We forget what is flesh blood and bone is human
Turning phone lines to airlines

In the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you
And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom
It's all in my head she read
In her girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself
Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries

And wants only to love you

Like some lost planet, never breathes any life
And barely moving, broken ears bend and crawl
Talk to where you're stuck in and I won't cease until dawn

Wake me up when you can hear
The sound of people getting near
Where what's dead come alive
And there's a long and lonely ride

Who can know there's so much life around us thins?
Life from heaven smiles down on this room

Coming over me like a storm
Used to feel so good beside her
There next to her my arm around her

She fell like flowers
Petals were carried out on my old wind
Landed down in the center
Of this lonely white grip of winter

She brought these gifts of love
I carried down in my pocket
I set them on my shelves
And on the nightstand by my bed

She sleeps and won't come back again
From pretty dreams that keep her
My baby won't come back again
I feel so lost without her

I hear your magic voice
On the analogue of this machine
I hear the smoothest talk
With the coolest transparent star field

Will there be any danger
If our talk is under this roof?
And can you know a stranger
So quickly under this moon?

So go away, come back again
I'll shut you out, I'll pull you in
Don't go away, come back again

She sleeps in royal blue
And room down past the big dry desert
The sense of music there
And hope reaches you

And gets you past the motions
Of goodbyes [Incomprehensible]
And pulls the deepest winter
Out of this lonely white crippled winter

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!

Red Norvo,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Red Norvo,"My gal and I, we had a fight 
And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too

All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean

No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way

But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

Tell me it's spring

Red Norvo,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Red Norvo,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Red Norvo,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die,

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team

Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Now I found out today
That all the words had slipped away, but I know
There's always a chance

Red Norvo,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
