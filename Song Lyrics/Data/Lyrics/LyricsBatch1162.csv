Sherwood,"


This is the easy life
This is the simple life baby
And you maybe just what I
Have always been searching for
A light through an open door darling
But you're guarding it all night

I will whisper a song in your ear
Of the things you've been missing my dear
If you remember the tune
It's all I can do
Just remember I wrote it for you

And I carry an open box
Of rusted and broken locks, slowly
Can you show me where to lie?
Cause I'm tired as I can be
My legs aren't a part of me darling
Let us go then, you and I, through the night

I will whisper a song in your ear
Of the things you've been missing my dear
If you remember the tune
It's all I can do
Just remember I wrote it for you

I will whisper a song in your ear
Of the things you've been missing my dear
If you remember the tune
It's all I can do
Just remember I wrote it for you
Just remember I wrote it for you






",The Simple Life
Sherwood,"Oh I don't believe it,
That I could be so deceiving
And bringing you down to feel this lack of loyalty.

You were a song in my head,
The warmth of the sheets in my bed.
A story forever told, but never old,
A warm arrival never left so cold.

Don't blink, don't close your eyes,
But most of all don't apologize.
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now.

Oh I don't believe it,
That I could be so deceiving
And bringing you down to feel this lack of loyalty.

'Cause you were a song in my head,
The warmth of the sheets in my bed.
A story forever told, but never old,
A warm arrival never left so cold.

Don't blink, don't close your eyes,
But most of all don't apologize.
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now.

There's a patch of blue in the stormy sky,
A memory of a brighter time.
When everything was new, and less watered down,
Before the summer turned to brown.

Don't say you can't believe it now,
That you're almost settled down,
'Cause you'll be right here,
When I come back around.

Don't blink, don't close your eyes,
But most of all don't apologize.
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now.

There's a patch of blue in the stormy sky,
A memory of a brighter time,
When everything was new, and less watered down,
Before the summer turned to brown.

Before the summer turned to brown
(don't blink, don't close your eyes)
Before the summer turned to brown
(don't blink, don't close your eyes)
Before the summer turned to brown
(don't blink, don't close your eyes)
",Song in My Head
Sheryfa Luna,"Un faux mouvement et tout s'efface
Comme un tourment qui nous dépasse
J'ai pris le temps pour te l'écrire
Si tu m'entends je peux te le dire

Tu me disais tout le temps que tout était ok pour toi
Oui mais l'amour passe, oui mais l'amour passe
Et sans te juger te sens-tu maintenant plus léger?
Je ne veux pas que ça passe comme ça...


Baby aime moi, aide moi, rêve moi, laisse moi
...espérer te voir regretter
Baby aime moi, aide moi, rêve moi, fais de moi
...la personne que tu pourras aimer

Nos désaccords semblent loin
Je me vois encore te tenir la main
Je prie que demain soit notre jour
que tu me dises cette fois c'est pour toujours

Et je continuerai de t'aimer même si ça me fait mal
car la douleur passe, la douleur passe
Et je resterai à attendre même si tu m'as fait mal
car les blessures s'effacent...


Baby aime moi, aide moi, rêve moi, laisse moi

les meilleurs et j'oublie les pires
Il me reste au moins la force d'y croire
Baby Aime Moi Encore!

you gotta love, you gotta love me...

car la douleur passe, la douleur passe
Et je resterai à attendre même si tu m'as fait mal

Sheryfa Luna,"Il était vraiment plus âgé que moi
Je suis tout bêtement tombée dans ses bras
Par lui j'ai découvert ce que je ne connaissais pas
Il semblait sincère, je l'aimais pour ça
Ce qui m'a toujours dérangé, est que rarement
Le soir je pouvais le capter
Mais dès qu'il me parlait, je la fermais

Il avait les mots
M'a rendue accro
Je voyais déjà l'avenir dans ses bras
Il avait les mots
M'a rendue accro
Je ne savais pas que je ne le connaissais pas
Il avait les mots

Je n'avais plus de vie
Je ne pensais qu'à lui
Même si j'ai cramé que souvent il mentait
Il se perdait dans ce qu'il me racontait
Se trompait de nom quand il disait qu'il m'aimait
Et je supportais, je pardonnais.

Dans sa caisse j'ai trouvé des jouets,
J'ai grillé que son ex continuait de l'appeler
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il cachait?
Je le découvrais.

Il avait les mots
M'a rendue accro
Je voyais déjà l'avenir dans ses bras
Il avait les mots
M'a rendue accro
Je ne savais pas que je ne le connaissais pas
Il avait les mots

Je l'ai suivi chez lui, bête de jardin et chien de compagnie
Putain de maison, on s'imagine tout de suite la vie de famille
Pendant tout ce temps
J'étais dans le faux, j'étais dans le faux

Sa femme m'a surprise
Elle est tout de suite venue m'avouer
Que je n’étais pas la première conne avec qui il s'amusait
Pendant tout ce temps
J'étais dans le faux, j'étais dans le faux

Ce qui m'a toujours dérangé est que rarement
Le soir je pouvais le capter
Mais je m'en doutais, mais je la fermais

Il avait les mots
M'a rendue accro
Je voyais déjà l'avenir dans ses bras

Sheryl,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Sheryl Crow,"Life springs eternal
On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all
I spent the best part of my losing streak

In an Army Jeep
For what I can't recall
Oh I'm banging on my TV set
And I check the odds

And I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blind
And I wonder what I'll find

[Chorus]
I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

Used to be I could drive up to
Barstow for the night
Find some crossroad trucker
To demonstrate his might

But these days it seems
Nowhere is far enough away
So I'm leaving Las Vegas today

[Chorus]

I'm standing in the middle of the desert
Waiting for my ship to come in
But now no joker, no jack, no king
Can take this loser hand
And make it win

[Chorus]

I quit my job as a dancer
At the Lido Des Girls
Dealing blackjack until one or two
Such a muddy line between
The things you want
And the things you have to do

[Chorus]

I'm leaving Las Vegas
And I won't be back
No I won't be back
Not this time",Leaving Las Vegas (Acoustic Version)
Sheryl Crow,"Took your car 
Drove to Texas 
Sorry  honey 
But I suspected we were through 

And I can't cry anymore 
Since I left 
Been feelin' better  cause that's 
What you get when you 

Stay together too long 
And I can't cry anymore 

[Chorus] 
Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere 
So long to this life 
So much for pretending 
Bad luck's never ending 
And now I know that 
Money comes is 
But the fact is 
There's not enough to 
Pay my taxes 

And I can't cry anymore 
Well, got a brother 
He's got real problems 
Heroin - no 

There's just no stopping him tonight 
And I won't cry anymore

It could be worse 
I could've missed my calling 
Sometimes it hurts 

But when you read the writing on the wall

With my heart in my hands 
Waiting for time to come and mend it

Sheryl Crow,"Downstairs they're playing Kenton 
The house set to swing 
I lay in my bed 
And listen to everything 

'Cause Leo's in rare form tonight 
His trombone sings so sweet 
This is the room 
Where they all come to meet 

He said 
I do what I can 
I live for the moment 
And that's who I am 
Yeah that's who I am 

And isn't it good 
If we could freeze moments in time 
We all would 
But I do what I can 
I do what I can 

Downstairs he's playing Kenton 
The Magnavox sighs 
But oh how the music has changed 
In all of our lives 

He says ""nobody listens 
To modern jazz"" 
And I'll never have what those guys have 

He says 
I do what I can 
I work for a living 
And that's who I am 
Yeah that's who I am 

And it's good to be alive 
But everything's different since Leo died 
I do what I can 

Is this the end of the modern world 
What could it mean for a young girl 
Who sees the pain on his face 
He does what he can 

The procession on the TV screen 
What could it possibly mean for a man 
who's come this far just to turn around 
Could there still be life in Kenton's swing 

With the Kennedys gone and everything 
Those sad rows of houses with their optimistic colors 
Democrat grandparents and draft-dodging brothers 
Riots down the street and discontented mothers 
We do what we can 

Downstairs it's quiet 
Less alive somehow 
Somehow he was everything that I am now 

And he says 
I do what I can 
I work for a living 
And that's who I am 
And that's who I am 

But it's good to be alive

We make to survive

In an over sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and

The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another

And show me your face tonight
I know it's true
No one heals me like you
And you hold the key

Never again
Would I turn away from you
I'm so heavy tonight
But your love is alright
And I do believe

That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be

It all comes down on me

You won't give up on me

We've been far, far away from here
I put on a poncho and played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between
Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now, everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?",If It Makes You Happy

Got witnesses to what the government denies

She likes lingerie but he prefers the sombrero

She wears teen perfume behind her knees

I sure hope you're happy

All day long she fills me up with dogma 
She's all magazines and benzedrine and vodka

But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing

It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate  to heaven's gate
And on the way  child and man
And woman wait  watch and wait
For redemption day

Fire rages in the streets
And swallow everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television

Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
Oh why we waited til so late
Was there no oil to excavate

No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells of night
It's everywhere a baby cries

Little superstar, oh honey that's what you are

I call you up been watching you for quite some time 
I beat around the streets like Bandini looking for Camilla 
I'll be satin and speed 
If you and I are still alive we'll get off these streets 
Well, there was a time I would've hung around just to be seen 
Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade 
Diamond rings and sparkily things won't make your shine stay

Put on mask 
Dance with my slowly
Is all that I ask
What is the hardest?
Falling in love
Knowing just where to begin or start

I will walk
I will walk with you
I will walk with you

Lay down beside me
Tell me your dreams
The view from inside
Is not what it seems
But no one will hurt you
Not like before
Your last thread of forgiveness
Won't reach the door no..

I will walk
I will walk with you
I will walk with you
I will walk
I will walk with you...yeah..

Pull up the curtains
Watch the night fall
Who has the answers
When no body calls?
Now the life fury
Blame the sunrise next
Because I was in love with you
But I can't change the past

I will walk
I will walk with you
I will walk with you.. 


",I Will Walk with You
Sheryl Crow,"The voices hanging in the air
The fingers running through my hair
You whisper in my ear, words I'm afraid to hear

You're sleeping on the wings of doves
Of melting in the heat of love
A voice that disappears, into the air

You said you found me, and never let me go, and until you do
No arms around me, to pull me away, away from you

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Like a moth to a flame, you're drawn to me with tender chains
You wrap me up so tight, and hold me all the night

Who's the stranger come and gone, statues crying in the lawn
The fountain's frozen tears, bring back those years

Did you think you loved me, and do you want me now like you did back then
No moon above me, could make me feel this way, feel this way again

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Where do the seasons go when you let them slip away
Now the winds have changed from hot to cold today
Indian summer, Indian summer, I remember you, where are you now

Ohhh, Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me, do you think of me too
Cause I remember you, Indian summer 


",Indian Summer
Sheryl Crow,"She walks the wire
Start to ending
But the wheeze is someone else inside her head
She swallowed fire
While pretending
That the flame has long been dead
And now love is just a stranger in her bed

She said this is the last time
I won't be back
I'll take a cab home
Before the second act
This is the last time
I'll turn that page
No more tomorrows
I'm full of empty yesterdays

Now cousin Sydney's such an outcast
Cause his parents ???????
An angry young man is on the warpath
There's so many things he'd change
If only he'd been better bet-all tell-all Hank

He said this is the last time
I won't be back
I'll take a cab home early
Before the second act
This is the last time
I'll change my ways
No more tomorrows
And the things I'd wished I'd always changed

In a shiny perfect world
Dashing boy gets girl
Are you one of the lonely ones
Seems I can't remember when
Or just how long it's been
Since I've been waiting for that train that never comes

And we said this is the last time
I won't be back
I'll take a cab home early
Before the second act
This is the last time
I'll turn that page
I left the opening rather early
Before they left the stage
This is the last time
I change my ways
No more tomorrows
I'm full of empty yesterdays

I only want you near me

Oh, I've been watching you from the corner of the sea
You are silent

You are silent

And I want them both on me
But in the quiet strain
The mention of your name
And I'm running from you
And running to you all the same

Sheryl Crow,"Baby, why do they say the things they say
Would it be easier to live the way they say we should
Maybe, cannot but wonder back this way
Yours are the only arms that make me feel like something can be good

I believe it's just a fact of life
Unless they wear our shoes to them it's black and white

Ooohhhh

Just what does it matter anyway
What side of the road we're standing on
And just what does it matter anyway
If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone
If nothing changes after we are gone

Baby, don't let them rob you of your pride
There's not a thing I wouldn't do to make this easier for you
Maybe, every now and then I laugh and cry
It's getting harder now for me to separate the two

Where does innocence turn in to make believe
Cause make believe there's no one here but me and you

Ohhh

Just what does it matter anyway
What side of the road we're standing on
And just what does it matter anyway
If you throw my love away because the world don't think it's right
And they may never understand
And you can't change the minds of those who are blind
Unless you give them sight
And the world lies in your hand

Tell me, and just what does it matter anyway
If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone
If nothing changes after we are gone
",What Does It Matter
Sheryl Crow,"I know I ask for nothing
And that's what I got from you tonight
I guess I thought you'd changed
Leaving becomes too easy
Easy by morning light
I still cannot explain

Is it enough to ask and not receive
Just one more kiss before you turn and leave
When love is over
Over it should be
But something still burns in me

A hundred solid reasons
The answers come in waves
But I'm all for calmer seas
You're only lost in the shuffle
But in your usual way
It's you who always comes to me

I've burned up pages
Hidden yesterdays
Here's one more glance before I turn away
When love is over
Over it should stay
But something won't go away

Hardly a moment passes
Hardly a single day goes by
I'm not remembering
Just to surrender slowly
Into a stranger's arms
But you stand watching in the wings

These must be days we've seen through tear-filled eyes
It all makes painful sense when I realize
When love is over
Something has to die
Cause you can say goodbye

Dangerously close to one another

Sheryl Crow,"I light your cigarettes 
I bring you apples from the vine 
How quickly you forget 
I run the bath and pour the wine 

I bring you everything that floats into your mind 
You don't bring me anything but down 
You don't bring me anything but down 
You don't bring me anything but down 

When you come 'round 
You are a raging sea 
I pull myself out everyday 
I plead insanity 

'Cause I can't leave  but I can't stay 
You say, ""Won't you come find me"" and ""Yes"" is what I say 
But you don't bring me anything but down 
No, you don't bring me anything but down 

Everything is crashing to the ground 
Maybe I'm not your perfect kind 
Maybe I'm not what you had in mind 
Maybe we're just killing time 

You with your silky words 
And your eyes of green and blue 
You with your steel beliefs 
That don't match anything you do 

It was so much easier before you became you 
Now you don't bring me anything but down 
No, you don't bring me anything but down 
Everything just crashes to the ground 

When you come around, when you come around 
No more playing seek and hide 
No more long and wasted nights 
Can't you make it easy on yourself 

I know you wish you were strong 
You wish you were never wrong 
Well, I got some wishes of my own",Anything But Down
Sheryl Crow,"I watched the sun come up on Portland 
I waved goodbye to all my friends 
I packed my car and headed to LA 
I gave away all my loose ends 

Somebody said you gotta get away 
To want to go back home again 
I left my universe standing there 
Holding the hand of my best friend 

And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you 
It's one more dusty rose about to turn 
I'll see you when I reach New Mexico 
If I'm in the mood to crash and burn 

I wrote a letter that I never mailed 
I rehearsed a dialogue in my head 
In case you ever wanted to track me down 
I'll take my cell phone to bed 

And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes 
And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn 
I call you up when my bottle's dry 
I'm on my way to crash and burn 

Antigone laid across the road 
And let a mack truck leave her there for dead 
Just because her lover split the scene 
Well love might be great but why lose your head 

Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you 
And my heart may break again before it learns 
And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again

I say I've gotten use to the crash and burn",Crash and Burn
Sheryl Crow,"I think I was wrong, I think you were right 
And all my angry words, will keep me up at night 
Through the old screen door I still hear you say  
""Oh, honey won't you stop treatin' me that way"" 

[Chorus]
If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
Then I'd no longer be in your mind the difficult kind 
'Cause babe I've changed 

Tell it to me slow, tell me with your eyes 
If anyone should know how to let it slide 
I swear I can see you, coming up the drive 
And there ain't nothing like regret, to remind you you're alive 

[Chorus]

I crossed the canyon a thousand times 
And never noticed what was mine 
What you'll remember of me tonight 
Well, it almost makes me cry 

Yeah, it almost makes me cry 
Oh,

Oh, ball-breaking moon and ridiculing stars 
Oh, the older I get, the closer you are 
Don't you got somewhere, that you need me 
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me 

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
Then I'd no longer be in your mind the difficult kind 
But you won't see the change in me, oh

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
But I'll forever be in your mind the difficult kind 
But you won't see 
No, you won't see the good in me

Yes babe, I've changed",The Difficult Kind
Sheryl Crow,"It don't hurt like it did 
I can sing my song again

Scraped the paper off the wall 
I put down carpet in the hall 
I left no trace of you at all 
And I can sing my song again 

I don't dream 'cause I don't sleep 
The moon is hanging like your hat 
The sun comes up  well  I don't see 
Curtains tied up like a bat 

The electric man looks good today 
Well, maybe not, well, I'm trying hard 
Trying hard to feel that way 
The electric man's a good place to start 

Took your paintings off the wall

I added on 'cause the house was feeling small 
Now I can sing my song again

Except for everyday or two 
I don't think of you no more

Bulldozed the house and watched it fall

Sheryl Crow,"We lay around just like gurus in borrowed robes 
And talk about nothing

You stretch out across a long long table 
Without hesitation you say  ""I'm willing and able"" 
Well  maybe that's something 
Maybe it's one thing more than I've seen 

That's something more than nothing 
You say good  I say you should 
Will you be there  yeah yeah yeah

Sheryl Crow,"Uncle Larry's hooked on ice again 
He seems to be stuck in the 80's 
He wears his ""members only"" jacket

I'll have mine in Martini glasses

Sheryl Crow,"Every stop of the way we walk the line 
Your days are numbered  so are mine 
Time is piling up  we struggle and we scrape 
All boxed in  nowhere to escape 

The city's just a jungle  more games to play 
All trapped in the heart of it trying to get away 
I was raised in the country  been working in the town 
I've been in trouble since I set my suitcase down 

I got nothing for you  had nothing before 
Don't even have anything for myself anymore 
Sky's full of fire and the rain is pouring down 
There's nothing you can sell me, so I'll see you around 

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime 
Could never do you justice, reason, or rhyme 
There's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

The devil's in the alley, the mule kicking in the stall 
Say anything you want to, I've heard it all 
I was thinking about the things that she said 
I was dreaming I was sleeping in your bed 

Walking through the leaves falling from the trees 
Feel like a stranger nobody sees 
So many things we never will undo 
I know you're sorry, well, I'm sorry too 

Some people will offer you their hand, and some won't 
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't 
I need something strong to distract my mind 
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind 

Well, I got here following the southern star 
I crossed that river just to be where you are 
There's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

Well, my ship's been split to splinter - it's sinking fast 
I'm drowning in the poison - got no future, got no past 
But my heart's not weary - it's light and it's free 
I've got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me 

Everybody's moving if they ain't already there 
Everybody's gotta move somewhere 
Well, stick with me baby, anyhow 
Things should start to get interesting right about now 

Well, my clothes are wet, they're tight on my skin 
Not tight as the corner I painted myself in 
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind 
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine 

The emptiness is endless - cold as clay 
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way 
Well, there's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

Yeah, the only thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 
The only thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Sheryl Crow,"I woke up and called this morning,
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore.

I made up the bed we sleep in.
I looked at the clock when you creep in.
It's 6 AM and I'm alone.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I was just beginning.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake.

Your friends are sorry for me.
They watch you pretend to adore me.
But I am no fool to this game.

Now here comes your secret lover,
She'll be unlike any other,
Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake.

Well maybe nothing lasts forever,
Even when you stay together.
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way.

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong.

Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?
Now you're my favorite mistake
Yeah you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake",My Favorite Mistake
Sheryl Crow,"I spent a year in the mouth of a whale with a flame and a book of signs 
You'll never know how hard I've failed trying to make up for lost time 
Once I believed in things unseen  I was blinded by the dark 
Out of the multitude to me he came and broke my heart 

When the dust in the fields has flown 
And the youngest of hearts has grown 
And you doubt you will ever be free 
Honey  don't bail on me 

River is wide and oh so deep and it winds and winds around 
I dream we're happy in my sleep, floating down and down and down 
And the tide rushes by where we stand 
And the earth underneath turns to sand 

And we're waiting for someone to see 
Honey, don't bail on me 
Tell Ma I loved a man even though I turned and ran 
Lovely and fine, I could've been, laying down in the palm of his hand 

Laying down in the palm of his hand 
Laying down in the palm of his hand 
Staying down in the palm of his hand 
In the morning you wait for the sun 

And secretly hope it won't come 
But time washes everything clean 
Honey, now don't bail on me 
Don't bail on me 

No, don't bail on me 
Ooh?",Riverwide
Sheryl Crow,"He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see his face
He takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Got a poke in the eye

Should we have the man impeached
Or should we shoot him in the foot

That we sit here watching sitcoms
That we have no clue to what is going on

The morning eggs will hit the wall
And everyone I know will call

Can I keep my scalp

Once it goes out

Open up the secret door
And now the truth is out
What are we gonna do about it

I'm not much on second hand information
Sycophantic recreations
Have been down with the smile
Now I rolled up my sleeves
And took off my good shoes

Without getting dirt in your eyes

Ooh, you go straight to the moon

And then watching them bloom
Ooh, isn't it strange
Once it goes up
It comes back down again

Ooh, it's too much too soon

Ooh, isn't it strange

Comes right back down again

Sheryl Crow,"Old James Dean Monroe,
Hands out flowers at the Shop-N-Go,
Hopes for money but all he gets is fear.
And the wind blows up his coat,
And this he scribbles on a perfume note,
""If I'm not here, then you're not here.""

And he says,
""Call me Miscreation,
I'm a walking celebration.""

And it's hard to make a stand,
And it's hard to make a stand,
Yeah, It's hard to make a stand

My friend, O' Lawdy,
Went to take care of her body,
And she got shot down in the road.
She looked up before she went,
Said, ""This isn't really what I meant.""
And the Daily News said, 'Two with one stone'

And I say,
""Hey there, Miscreation,
Bring a flower, time is wasting.""

And it's hard to make a stand.
And it's hard to make a stand.
Yeah, It's hard to make a stand.
Yeah, It's hard to make a stand.

Yes it is.

We got loud guitars and big suspicions,
Great big guns and small ambitions,
And we still argue over who is God.

And I say,

Bring a flower, time is wasting.""
I say,
""Hey there, Miscreation,

Let's get down
Let's turn the radio on

And cowboy Jim's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

[Chorus]
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Well there goes the neighborhood

The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Making a killing through the U.S. mail

This is the movie of the screenplay
Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie.
The messenger gets shot down
Just for carrying the message to a flunkie.

But the after-party's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your

Sheryl Crow,"I woke up and called this morning,
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore.

I made up the bed we sleep in.
I looked at the clock when you creep in.
It's 6 AM and I'm alone.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I was just beginning.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake.

Your friends are sorry for me.
They watch you pretend to adore me.
But I am no fool to this game.

Now here comes your secret lover,
She'll be unlike any other,
Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake.

Well maybe nothing lasts forever,
Even when you stay together.
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way.

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong.

Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?
Now you're my favorite mistake
Yeah you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake",My Favorite Mistake [Live at Central Park]
Sheryl Crow,"Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
And dig your grave
Heartless challenge

Pick your path and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise- loves- to go down
Lousy lovers- pick their prey

But they never cry out loud
Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love

Is it over now- do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home.
Rock on- ancient woman
Follow those who pale

In your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Did she make you cry

Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now- do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home.",Gold Dust Woman
Sheryl Crow,"Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
Always burned a hole in my pants
Never get to school mama happy baby
But always blew a second chance

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I never took candy from strangers
Never wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me happy
Come on baby, keep me happy

Never got a flash out of cocktails
Never had a flesh off the bone
I never got a lift out of Lear Jets baby
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, keep me happy
Won't you keep me happy

Happy
Ooh, happy baby

Sheryl Crow,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Sheryl Crow,"Ah, in a white room with black curtains, near the stations
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses, run down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Drawn light smiles on your leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
When I walked out, felt my own need just beginning 
I'll sleep in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation from the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tiggers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Wait here with you where the shadows run from themselves",White Room
Sheryl Crow,"He's got a smile
And it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky

And now and then when I see his face
It takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, ooh oh, sweet child 'o mine
Oh, oh oh oh sweet love of mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh, ooh oh sweet child o' mine
Ooh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Oh, oh oh oh sweet child o' mine
Ohh, sweet love of mine

In the middle of this blizzard
You stood and melted all the ice

You were master of so many
Savior to none
I waged all of my hopes so plenty on you
Now look what I've become

6 AM and I'm alone

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending
To the bad day, I was just beginning
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

Now your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

Now here comes your secret lover
She'll be unlike any other

To the bad day I've gotten used to spending
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

Maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter
Won't let me go so I'm holding on this way

Well did you know
Could you tell
You were the only one
That I ever loved

Sheryl Crow,"Feeling weak today 
Run the risk of tears 
Falling down your cheeks 
From all the lonely years 

Holding back your love 
While she races up the hill 
Chase what you dream of 
But always standing still 

All and all you see 
Everything is history 
Think of all that you've been missing 
And every now and then 
Shadows bring you back again 
To think of all the things you're missing 

Lay the pictures out 
Pull the curtains down 
Don't let us see you breathe 
Your happiness you fake 

Sending up a flare 
If anybody really cares 
To talk a little while 
The past to reconcile 

All in all you see 
Everything is history 
Think of all the things you're missing 
Every now and then 

I can almost picture him 
Think of all the things 
Of all the things

I do 
Hear the morning creeping in 
And the spirit sings again 
Well you will 

You will 
See the beauty in this moment 
Every time you're standing still 
Time you're standing still 

These times are tougher weathered 
Someday the wind will carry you home 
And you'll be free 
And you'll be free 

No one will pull you down 
You'll wake up and look around 
And never again

For something I could believe
So I turned on the TV
I was fed hypocrisy
Leading me towards a sea of confusion

I heard a voice
Ringing like music in the air
Breaking hearts most everywhere
All the people in despair
Cry out for justice to be fair to every people

Saying let's get free, let's get free
Don't just believe in what you hear
Don't just believe in what you see
Let's get free, let's get free
You've gotta open up your mind
'Cause truth is what you need
Oh, truth is what you need

All the love
Can prop you up and make you stand
Some are sinking in the sand
With all that silver in their hand
Take a message to that man
That wisdom is power

And tell me now
Do you have Allah on your side?
Or is it Jesus, or your pride?
Will it get you through the night?
Every man has to find something to believe in

Let's get free, let's get free
You gotta believe in what you feel
And feel what you believe
Let's get free, let's get free
You can open up your heart
'Cause love is all you need
Oh, love is all you need

Before the dawn
Comes the darkest hour of night
You either walk into the light
Or you turn and close your eyes
And fade into a dreamless sleep and hide

Well every human
Is gonna laugh and sometimes cry
But every tear that fills your eyes
Falls with the weight of sacrifice
Forgiveness is the pain of disappointment

Let's get free, let's get free
Don't just believe in what you hear
Don't just believe in what you see
Let's get free, let's get free

When I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

Consolation from the old wound now forgotten

When everything you want is straight ahead
And every thing I thought worth learning
Is forgotten when I see your face instead

Rolling round but when you go and let somebody in

Along the way, it can get too complicated to say

Free to fly

Burning faster than the cursed star
Falling back down to the Earth

Closer still
You will find me standing on the hill
Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide
Now, come inside

And every time you go it hurts me so

Sheryl Crow,"My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away
But every now and then you come to mind
'Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
But when your name was called, you found a place to hide
When you knew that I was always on your side

Well everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
But your demons and your angels reappeared
Leavin' all the traces of the man you thought you'd be
Leavin' me with no place left to go from here
Leavin' me so many questions all these years

But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally
This isn't how it's really meant to be
No it isn't how it's really meant to be

Well they say that love is in the air, but never is it clear,
How to pull it close and make it stay
Butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away
And I'm left to carry on and wonder why
Even through it all, I'm always on your side

But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are we left to wonder, all alone, eternally
But is this how it's really meant to be
No is it how it's really meant to be

Well if they say that love is in the air, never is it clear
How to pull it close and make it stay
If butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away
Leavin' me to carry on and wonder why
Was it you that kept me wondering through this life
When you know that I was always on your side",Always on Your Side
Sheryl Crow,"I was lost inside a daydream
Swimming through the saline

It all comes down to creating time
You don't always have to make it right
We'll all drive by in our hybrid lives
Chances are we'll make it back

I was doing time in the LA jail
My karma was living inside a failure
No matter how it don't matter now
Rest assured the rest is blurred

It all comes down to doing time
We don't always have to make it a crime
We'll all drive off in our hybrid lives

Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide

Sheryl Crow,"Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
A man who wasn't sad at all by what's going on
And even though I'm trying to smile
With everything I see it could take a while

I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?

Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
Along the way we got off track
Now if we turn around, can we ever get back?

I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
Where has all the love gone?
I know it was there when we were gone

Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
If it's true we'd lost our way
Then what have we got?

I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know

We walk the line
Your days are numbered
So are mine

Time is piling up
We struggle and we scrape
All boxed in
Nowhere to escape

The city's just a jungle
More games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it
Trying to get away

I was raised in the country
Been working in the town
I been in trouble since I
Set my suitcase down

I ain't got nothing for you
I had nothing before
Don't even have anything
For myself anymore

And the rain is pouring down

And thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice

I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

The mule kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna
I've heard it all
I was thinking about the things that she said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in you bed

Walking through the leaves
Falling from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, well I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind

Well I got here, following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters
I's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison
Got no future
Got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me

Everybody's moving if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Well stick with me baby anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet
Tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

The emptiness is endless
Cold as clay
You can always come back
But you can't come back all the way

Well there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah the only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The only thing that I did wrong

Sheryl Crow,"She was born in November 1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That every man could be free
So her mama got high, high, high
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places
That he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she's need to carry on
He taught her how to

Run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run

Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
so long
Baby loves to run

She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain
She's searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on

So run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run

From the old familiar faces and
Their old familiar ways
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long

Sheryl Crow,"Quiet hour
You have always been my wildflower
Showing up wherever beauty's lost its way
Your heart must break

I was free
Until I heard the song you sang me to me
Pulling me away from everything I knew
To be with you

And everything I know just fades away
And every time you go it hurts me so
I don't know why when I know we're free
Free to fly

Here we are
Burning faster than the cursed star
Falling back down to the Earth
I love you so it sometimes hurts

Closer still
You will find me standing on the hill
Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide
Now, come inside

And everything I know just fades away
And every time you go it hurts me so
I don't know why when I know we're free
Free to fly

And that's the way it is when nature plays its lovely hand

With a flame and a book of signs

And the youngest of hearts has grown

And it winds and winds around
I dream we're happy in my sleep
Floating down and down and down

And the tide rushes by where we stand
And the earth underneath turns to sand
And we're waiting for someone to see
Don't bail on me

Tell ma I loved a man
Even though I turned and ran
Lovely and fine I could have been
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Staying down in the palm of his hand

The morning eggs will hit the wall

And London suffered sweltering heat
And the gangs of Mini Coopers
Took the battle to the streets

For no more trucks and no more cars
They threw cans of petrol through the windows at Scotland Yard

And they yelled,

They held them up for ransom
Without disturbing their high tea

They stalled in the Riyadh streets

When your tank is on empty

The final can of gasoline was loaded on a truck
And driven through the streets of Agra to the palace aqua duct
You see, all the majesty of worship that once adorned these fatal halls
Was just a target for the angry

Standing guard on my front drive
Snipers on the roof poised at those

Even try?

Well I got a big car
And a flat screen TV
All my loser friends
And my boyfriend's family

Bring bags of food
And watch reality freak shows
Everybody's faking it
But nobody thinks so

Oh why
Even try?

[Chorus]
Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free
Got no reason to bitch
Ain't no parties I've missed
Got to have it that way
'Cause baby I got, motivation

Skinny young dude
In a hundred dollar tee shirt
In King James kicks
And a brand new manicure

Hotties doing pilates
With the snotties and the pleasers
Sneaking in the back door
At Coconut Teasers

Why
Even try?

Well, I dropped out of school
When I was seventeen
'Cause I didn't have time
To study my magazines

'Cause there's a lot to learn
From the privileged few
Like how to build a brand
Wearing high heeled shoes

Oh why
Even try?

Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free

I'm gonna own this town
I'm gonna own this town
I'm gonna own this town
Yeah, it's all mine

And, I'm afraid some long lonely road

There's a chain around your mind
When something is holding you tightly
What is real is so hard to find

Losing babies to genocide

Can't you see that we've really bought into
Every word they proclaimed and every lie, oh

If we could only get out of our heads, out of our heads
And into our hearts
If we could only get out of our heads, out of our heads
And into our hearts

Someone's feeding on your anger
Someone's been whispering in your ear
You've seen his face before
You've been played before

Tripping now on the smallest things
Trying to reach the light, trying to reach the light

Sheryl Crow,"I walked the heat of seven hills
Endless talk of losing wills
Great highways in a constant melt
Men and women and children all have overbuilt

Creatures of a waning sun
Teacher's hands are overrun
Clowns and gypsies all but gone

Shine over Babylon
(You make me wanna)
Shine over Babylon

Freedoms etched on Sacred pillars
Hollow stones of mindless filler
Can lead to madman oil drillers
Won't be long before we all are killers

Little boy lost way up the mountains
Cities drowning under boiling fountains
I dreamed of chilly, sunlit days
I was trembling in a golden haze

[Chorus]

We celebrate the golden cow
Praise the bloated bank account
If there's a God where is he now
The precipice is slipping further out

Sanskrit message from the mounts
Leave your possession, hope abounds
There's nothing here for you to cry about
We're all just followers from here on out

I take the stage, I walk the planks
I sing these songs with little thanks
I wait for shouts from crazy cranks
I stand amidst the brown shirt ranks

I found my way to Alexandria
Where gurus bubble up on ganga
Scavengers, they run up and hand ya
All the junk that should have damned ya

If everything in life was free
You'd float in your own reverie
The things that you could never see
Seal the gap between you and me

All through the night
Guardian angels God will send thee
All through the night

Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
Hill and dale in slumber sleeping
I, my loving vigil keeping
All through the night

While the moon, her watch is keeping
All through the night
While the weary world is sleeping
All through the night

O'er thy spirit gently stealing
Visions of delight revealing
Breathes a pure and holy feeling
All through the night

Though I roam a minstrel lonely
All through the night
My true harp shall praise sing only
All through the night

Love's young dream alas is over
Yet my strains of love shall hover
Near the presence of my lover
All through the night

Hark, a solemn bell is ringing
Clear through the night
And thou my love art heavenward winging
Home through the night

Earthly dust from off thee shaken
Soul immortal shalt thou awaken
With thy last dim journey taken
Home through the night
Home through the night
Home through the night

Put out the lawn chair and turn on the hose
We’ll play jack Johnson he’s the new don ho

Are the only things that didn’t get lost

But it ain’t doing us any good
Rolling through town and going too slow
What we need is an open road

400 horses need a little room to run
Well if you ain’t gonna do it let me show you how it’s done

Drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented
What’s the point of money if you ain’t gonna spend it?
There’s a reason roads go past the city limits
Do you wanna drive? Come on, you can ride shotgun
Shotgun

Traffic jam as I’m sitting by, old man holding that same old sign
Tell me that the end is near but they’ve been saying that 100 years
But what if he’s right, baby?
Maybe this time it’s true
And we got nothing to lose

Drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented
What’s the point of money if you ain’t gonna spend it?
There’s a reason roads go past the city limits
Do you wanna drive? Then baby you can ride shotgun
Shotgun

We gotta drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented
What good is your money if you ain’t gonna spend it?
There’s a reason roads go past the city limits
If you ain’t gonna drive then baby come on, ride shotgun

Sheryl Crow,"Riding in the backseat, sipping on a Pepsi
Looking out the window, driving to the bus stop together
I tell her only three sleeps and I'll be right back
And then we're gonna have a good time when I come together

And I call her every single night
I'll miss her every day
And if she kissed me and waved goodbye
I could hear her say

Stay at home, mother
Stay at home
Stay at home, mother
Stay at home

I've been working late nights making up for the times
That I wasn't in the crowd cheering out loud at our school plays
Tickets to a circus, maybe a new bike
I just want her to know that I love her more than working all day

But the price will never measure up
To what's inside a box
While I run all around the world
She tells me to stop

And stay at home, mother
Stay at home
Stay at home, mother
Stay at home

We could play house and pretend
That tomorrow you won't be gone
Stay at home, mother
Stay at home

Wishing things were different
Doesn't change one memory
My little girl grew up
While I was too busy to see
Now she's become the one thing
That I could never be

Stay at home, mother
Stay at home
Stay at home, mother
Stay at home

She could have a house and a couple of kids
And never have to be involved
As a stay at home mother
Stay at home mother

Sheryl Crow,"So he wants to know
Does Superman really need to wear his cape to fly?
Where does rain come from?
And can I play outside?
All my friends have daddies, mommy why don't I?

And so I wear waterproof mascara
There's things you shouldn't see when you're a kid
Thank God they make waterproof mascara
'Cause it won't run like his daddy did

So I'm dating again
Letting my guard down is just so hard to do
Never introduced my son to someone new
'Cause if I get my heart broke
I know he will too

And that's why I wear waterproof mascara
Some things you shouldn't see when you're a kid
Thank God they make waterproof mascara
'Cause it won't run like his daddy did

I can throw the ball out in the yard
Teach him how to fish
How to drive a car
But in my heart, it just wont be enough
We've always gotten by somehow
I may not need a man right now
But I know he does

Sheryl Crow,"It’s the middle of the week
I’m just driving home
The sun’s going down and nothing’s going on

They played Whiskey River, I turn it up
And suddenly it hit me how thirsty I was

It’s only Wednesday night, gotta get up early
And tell you the truth, I ain’t that worried
Bout that right now so I think I’m gonna hit downtown and get loud

Well it’s one of them nights, feels like we oughta be drinkin'
We gotta get a little rowdy like we’re living in a country song
But some nights are made for staying at home
Sitting on the couch, watching TV alone
But tonight it sure feels like we oughta be drinkin

I’ll be damned
I’m not the only one here
Looks like the whole damn town’s in the mood for a beer

It ain’t the weekend yet, even 2 for 1 night
‘Cause we’re just drawn to that heavy neon light

I’m glad I hate my job
What’s your excuse?
You got a broken heart or are you just thirsty too?

Could be anything
But whatever the case
I think we’re all planning on getting shit-faced

But it’s one of them nights, feels like we oughta be drinkin
We gotta get a little rowdy like we’re living in a country song
But some nights are made for staying at home
Sitting on the couch and watching TV alone
But tonight it sure feels like we oughta be drinkin

But some nights are made for staying at home
And roll a big fat blunt and watching Nashville alone
But tonight it sure feels like we oughta be drinkin
Honey tonight it sure feels like we oughta be drinkin
Yeah tonight it sure feels like we oughta be drinkin",We Oughta Be Drinkin'

How do we undo what we've done?
