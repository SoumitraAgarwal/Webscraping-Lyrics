Azucar Moreno,"Molino de agua, molino de viento 
Por ti me duele la sangre 
Que va regando mi cuerpo 

Molino de viento, molino de agua 
Necesito de tu aliento 
Porque sin ti no soy nada 

En el molino del amor contigo 
Quisiera ser grano de trigo 

Tu cuerpo de espiga verde 
Quiero sentirlo muy cerca 
Pero me lo estas negando 
Y a mi me mata la pena 

En el molino del amor 
Mi corazón por ti suspira 

Molino de agua, molino de viento 
Por ti me duele la sangre 
Que va regando mi cuerpo 

Molino de viento, molino de agua 
Necesito de tu aliento 
Porque sin ti no soy nada 

En el molino del amor contigo 
Quisiera ser grano de trigo 

Te voy siguiendo los pasos 
Como si fuera tu sombra 
Por un camino difícil 
Donde mis besos se ahogan 

En el molino del amor 
Se muere mi corazón 
Por ti se muere 

Molino de agua, molino de viento 
Por ti me duele la sangre 
Que va regando mi cuerpo 

Molino de viento, molino de agua 
Necesito de tu aliento 
Porque sin ti no soy nada",El Molino de Amor
Azucar Moreno,"No quiero que me quieras que luego te vas 
No quiero que me uses como a las demás 
No quiero que me digas que ya me avisaste 
Que lo tuyo es un juego y tiene un final 

No quiero que me quieras según tu moral 
No quiero si te cansas pasarlo fatal 
No quiero que me obligues a seguir tus reglas 
Que lo tuyo es un juego y a mi no va 

No quiero que me quieras si acabaré odiándote 
Búscate otra mas tonta a quién hacer daño 
Prefiero estar a solas tranquila en mi cuarto 
Y no en tu compañía llorando y llorando 

No quiero verte mas 
Oh no oh no 
Intenta o liarme 
No, no, no 
No puedo soportar 
Oh no, oh no 
Tu gusto por coleccionar amantes 

No quiero que me quieras que luego te vas 
No quiero que me pises no soy una mas 
No quiero que me cuentes batallas y tachingas 
Que lo tuyo es un juego y lo juegas mal 

No quiero que me quieras según tu moral 
No quiero si te cansas pasarlo fatal 
No quiero que me obligues a seguir tus reglas 
Que lo tuyo es un juego y a mi no va 

No quiero que me quieras si acabaré odiándote 
Búscate otra mas tonta a quién hacer daño 
Prefiero estar a solas tranquila en mi cuarto 
Y no en tu compañía llorando y llorando 

No quiero verte mas

Intenta o liarme 
No, no, no 
No puedo soportar 
Oh no, oh no 
Tu gusto por coleccionar amantes",No Quiero Que Me Quieras
Azucar Moreno,"En el bar del camino 
Donde un día nos sentamos, 
Un día recuerdo las amapolas 
Que entre tu y yo cortamos 

Yo caminaba en silencio 
Y tu me dabas la mano 
Después de largo camino 
Tus ojos se me apartaron 

Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 

Siempre que cierro los ojos 
Tu persona me aparece 
Y un hondo beso en la boca 
Yo por ti llevo presente 

Dame , dame un beso mas 
Yo ya no tengo alegrías 
Porque te llevo muy dentro 
Vida mía, vida mía 

Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero 
Porque te quiero",Porque Te Quiero
Azucar Moreno,"Ese amor que tu me brindas 
Ese no lo quiero yo 
Ese amor que tu me brindas 
Ese no lo quiero yo 

Que muchas veces 
Y en tus ojos leo traición 
Que si, que no 
En tus leo traición 
Que si, que no 
En tus ojos leo traición 

No quiera equivocarme 
Te lo pido por favor 
No quiera equivocarme 
Te lo pido por favor 
Se sincero con tus besos 
Que en tu boca muero yo 
Que si, que no 
En tu boca muero yo 
Que si, que no 
En tu boca muero yo 

Cuando vengas a mis brazos 
Entrégate con amor 
Cuando vengas a mis brazos 
Entrégate con amor 
Que sientan como tus labios 
Que me abracen de pasión 
Que si, que no 
Que me abracen de pasión 
Que si, que no 
Que me abracen de pasión 

En el negro de tus besos 
Yo ubico mi perdición 
En el negro de tus besos 
Yo ubico mi perdición 
Yo en tus besos me muero

Azucar Moreno,"Ayer noche en la calle 
Yo no se lo que había, no, no 
Todo el mundo bailaba, si 
No se porque y fui a ver 
A la reina de la noche 

Allí estaba sonando 
Alegría y color 
Y ese humo fresquito 
Que te hace bailar 
Y sin pensar 
Ves como tus pies se mueven 

Rumba en el barrio 
Rumba pa ti 
Rumba en el barrio 
Rumba pa ti 

Ven conmigo a la plaza 
No podrás resistir el compás 
Esta rumba que manda, si 
Ya lo veras que tu y yo 
Terminamos en tu casa 

Rumba en el barrio 
Rumba pa ti 
Rumba en el barrio 
Rumba pa ti 

Solo tienes que bailar 
No lo tienes que pensar 
Y la rumba ya lo hará por ti

Azucar Moreno,"Tu me pides una cosa que yo 
Yo no puedo darte 
Ay amor mío tu me pides una cosa que yo 
Yo no puedo darte 
Ay tu me pides que cierre mis ojos 
Que me eche en tus brazos 
Como en una cárcel 

Aprieta mi boca, átame con tu mirada 
Aprieta mi mano no me dejes que me vaya 
Yo quiero sentirme libremente aprisionada 
Pero dejo siempre abierta aquella puerta 
Por si mañana 

Tu me pides una cosa que yo 
Yo no puedo darte 
Ay amor mío tu me pides una cosa que yo 
Yo no puedo darte 
Ay tu me pides que cierre mis ojos 
Que me eche en tus brazos 
Como en una cárcel 

Porque no me besas mientras yo sueño contigo 
Yo quiero besarte mientras tu sueñas conmigo 
Y quiero sentirte respirar en mis oídos 
Y que el tiempo se detenga a nuestros pasos 
Sin el mañana 

Tu me pides una cosa que yo

Azucar Moreno,"Ves en mis ojos una extraña expresión 
Un vacío infinito 
Y un profundo temor 

Entre dos lunas veo mi mente girar 
Una luna es la vida 
Y una luna es la paz 

Ilusiones nada mas

Que me llevan lejos de ti 

Y Hazme el amor, acaríciame

Azucar Moreno,"La Luna me ronda tus ojos cansa'os de mí
Tendiendo sus redes en mi corazón
La Luna en lo alto me lleva derecho a tí
Su influjo me haré perder la razón
La noche fue imán que nos unió
No pienso mirar atrás
Llévame hasta el final
Hechizo de luna que sobre mí
y embrujando mi corazón
Mi piel ardiendo contra tu piel

Solos la Luna, tú y yo
La noche nos cubre con mantos de oro y marfil
Estrellas vestidos de nuestra pasión
Estréchame fuerte que hoy todo puede ocurrir
La noche es eterna, eclipse de Sol
Mañana, lo sé, tú partirás

Azucar Moreno,"Cuando la tarde languidece renacen las sombras
En las que tu los cafetales vuelves a sentir
Escucharas esta canción de la vieja molienda
Que en el letargo de la noche parece decir
Cuando la tarde languidece renacen las sombras
En las que tu los cafetales vuelves a sentir
Escucharas esta canción de la vieja molienda

Que en el letargo de la noche parece decir

Azucar Moreno,"Viene oculto en su disfraz 
Y te puede sorprender 
Cuando menos tu lo crees 
Es enigma a descifrar 

Argumento accidental 
Que se cuela en el sabor 
De tu boca y tu razón 
Y sin saber 
Te atraviesa de revés 

Y te pone a alucinar 
Es un sorbo de coñac 
Con veneno de emoción 
Que te sube al corazón 
Que golpea donde es 
Y disfruta al poseer 

El amor, que se para en una esquina 
Nos asalta y nos derriba 
Cuando atrapa nos domina 
Y en el alma se amotina 
Nos eleva tan violento 
Que tocamos firmamento 
Y vivimos en un sueño 
El amor, el que no se falsifica 
El que siempre está optimista 
De que venga cada día 
El amor, dulce esencia de la vida 
Que se hace llama infinita 
Que nos lleva hasta la cima 

Déjate llevar cuando llegue a ti 
Déjalo quedar cuando venga a ti 
Déjate llevar cuando llegue a ti 
Déjalo quedar cuando venga a ti 

Cuando viene por ahí 
Es difícil eludir 
El se mete entre tu piel 
Con esa ansiedad de sed 

El te inspira lo mejor 
Te encierra en su callejón 
Donde no hay más que abordar 
En su viaje para amar 
Y sin saber 
Te atraviesa de revés 

Y te pone a alucinar 
En un sorbo de coñac 
Con veneno de emoción 
Que te sube al corazón 
Que golpea donde es 
Y disfruta al poseer 

El amor, que se para en una esquina 
Nos asalta y nos derriba 
Cuando atrapa nos domina 
Y en el alma se amotina 
Nos eleva tan violento 
Que tocamos firmamento 
Y vivimos en un sueño 
El amor, el que no se falsifica 
El que siempre está optimista 
De que venga cada día 
El amor, que se para en una esquina 
Nos asalta y nos derriba 
Cuando atrapa nos domina 
Y en el alma se amotina 
Nos eleva tan violento 
Que tocamos firmamento 
Y vivimos en un sueño 
El amor, el que no se falsifica 
El que siempre está optimista 
De que venga cada día 

Déjate llevar cuando llegue a ti 
Déjalo quedar cuando venga a ti 
Déjate llevar cuando llegue a ti 
Déjalo quedar cuando venga a ti 

El amor, que se para en una esquina 
Nos asalta y nos derriba 
Cuando atrapa nos domina

Azucar Moreno,"Hay que saber perder 
El corazón nunca miente 
Nunca podré odiar 
Lo que tanto he querido 

Ciencia, misterio y amor 
Combinación muy extraña 
Viene del corazón 
Y el corazón nunca engaña 

Triqui, chiqui, chiqui,chi 
Si viene a ti un sentimiento 
No lo dejes nunca ir 
Escucha bien tu pensamiento 

Triqui,chiqui, chiqui,chi 
De frenesí grita tu pecho 
Cuando vuela un colibrí 
Dentro del alma satisfecho 

Hay que saber perder 
Con el dolor que se tenga 
De todo se puede aprender 
No hay mal que por bien no venga 

Espíritu sobre razón 
Combinación muy extraña

De amor y pasión 
Águila que vuela 
Ave de candela

Azucar Moreno,"Tengo dos sueños, dulce aroma 
Ladrón de amores que me roba a oscuras 
Una mirada siempre enamorada 
Que mira a tus ojos mientras me amas

Tengo un silencio que se hace palabras 
De un recuerdo tuyo que me quiebra el alma 
Siendo una sombra combatiendo el alba 
Por sacarle al día la noche mas larga 

Ladrón de amores atrapado en la pasión 
Por despojarme te enredo mi corazón 
Como una tela te enmarañas en mi habitación 
Perdiendo la cordura en mis caderas el control

Ladrón de amores una trampa de carmín 
Tejen mis labios para no dejarte huir 
Quemándome en tus manos no parezco tener fin 
Y es que tu naciste sin saberlo para mi

Tengo un romance que a la luz del día 
Se escapa contigo y con mis fantasías 
Una espera larga que se hace pequeña 
Cuando regresas y yo soy tu dueña

Tengo en mi cuerpo mil y una delicias 
Que dejan tus manos cuando me acarician 
Hacemos una tu piel y la mía 
Y el calor no rompe la noche mas fría 

Ladrón de amores atrapado en la pasión

Que no fue más que verte y perder
La fe, el coraje, el ansia'e guapear
No me has dejado ni el pucho en la oreja
De aquel pasao malevo y feroz
Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

Ayer, de miedo a matar
En vez de pelear
Me puse a correr
Me vi en la sombra o finao
Pensé en no verte y temblé
Si yo, que nunca aflojé
De noche angustiao
Me encierro a llorar
¡Decí por Dios qué me has da'o
Que estoy tan cambiao
¡No sé más quién soy!",Malevaje

Mataron la confianza

Abre las puertas, déjame entrar
Que nuestra historia se repita una why otra vez
Por que herirnos? si nos amamos tanto
Abre tus puertas a este amor

Maybe we'll go for a ride

You said you'd take me nowhere
I said that suits me just fine
I know you've always been near
Whispering secrets I know 

I'm not supposed to hear
Hold your heart with two hands
Give it to me only to disappear
Look how low I've sunk

Don't ask me to rise
I'll only lose you when I'm high

Love survives only when we are apart

I can't sleep I can't speak to you
And so I'm reaching out for the one

And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes 
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light 
As it tints the shade of you

Nobody's lost but nobody wins",Sleep

With my family that I chose
You're my family
And on the pavement still gripping the phone
You came and wrapped your arms around my soul
And we were shaking 
And you're so much a part of me
And so this is why I'm here
When we called you
You came so fast
And sat beside me while hours and days past
I'll always thank you for that

And there you were
With your heart made of gold
So strong, the only thing holding us up
And we knew you would always be so close
And so this is why I'm here
And then there was you
You always made us laugh
And you would help us to find the right path
And there is no one as full of life

That keep me hovered above the ground
And nights just blend into the morning

If I were to stay here between us 
I might forget where I'm bound
So I can't stay in between us
I guess I'll walk away

And here to read the future
But forced to breathe out the past
And too many conversations 
To uncover what was purposefully lost

Ah
Ah

And we all look so desperate
Showing the guidance that we lack
And we used to be so wistful
I guess we feel it's safer holding back

Azure Ray,"So I'm waiting for this test to end 
So these lighter days can soon begin 
I'll be alone by maybe more carefree 
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly 
I was afraid to be alone 
Now I'm scared that's how I'd like to be 
All the faces none the same 
How can there be so many personalities 
So many lifeless empty hands 
So many hearts in great demand 
And now my sorrow seems to far away
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain 
But I turn them off and tuck them away 
Till these rainy days that make them stay 
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs 
And the words still ring, once here now gone
And they echo through my head everyday 
And I don't think they'll ever go away 
Just like tihnking of your childhood home 
But we can't go back were on our own 
Oh, 
Why does she sing these sad songs for me, 
I'm not the one
To tenderly bring her soft sympathy I've just begun
To see my way clear it's plain, if I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear for her pain, 
A tear and that's all.

What does she want me to do?
She says that she that knows moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
And on she goes to say I don't care 
When she knows that I do.

Well, maybe she just has to sing, 
For the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am 
To decide that she's wrong.

She'd like to think I was cruel,
She knows that's a lie for I would be
No more than a tool
If I allowed her to cry all over me.

Oh my sorrow is real even though 
I can't change my plans
If she could see how I feel then 
I know she'd understand

Does she actually think I'm to blame?
Does she really believe that some word of mine 
Could relieve all her pain?
Can't she see that she grieves just because 
She's been blindly deceived
By her shame?

Well, maybe she just has to sing, 
For the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am 
To decide that she's wrong.

I know nothings what it seems, 
Maybe one day she'll start to realize
That if she abandons her dreams 
Then all the words she can say are only lies
When will she see that the gain is only to lose?
All that she offers me are her chains, 
And I got to refuse.

But it's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend it's something 
That she should defend, with her pride
And I don't intend to stand here and be 
The friend from whom she must hide.

Well, maybe she just has to sing, 
For the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide 
That she's wrong.
Well, maybe she just has to sing, 
For the sake of the song",For the Sake of the Song

B and the Buzz,"Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold 
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met 
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

B and the Buzz,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

The rhythm and the bass makes you want to dance

Everybody in the place it's time to take it

B'Four,"Midnight, on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave's chicane
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebbtide
Morning, don't get here tonight
Searching for her silver light

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Bank job in the city
Robin Hood and William Tell
And Ivanhoe and Lancelot
They don't envy me
Sitting 'til the sun goes down
In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head",Can't Get It Out of My Head

Drifting far away
But she can't see through

Don't lose your ground
Remember how you felt before
And if you care about her
Show her that you're sure

If I were you
My prized possessions
Would be the ones I'd hold so close
'Cause when you lose your love
You lose what means the most
If I were you
I'd hold affection

Higher than any star in sight
Take this to heart
And you'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I were you

Simple pleasures
The hardest to be found
Can't be measured
'Till they're not around
Maybe she'll go
Maybe she'll stay
But she'd rather go than fade away
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow
Is the saddest fate

If I were you
My prized possessions
Would be the ones I'd hold so close
'Cause when you lose your love
You lose what means the most
If I were you

If you want to survive in these motherfuckin' streets

I got kind in my mackin', I started to stackin' in the Valle'
You see I sent that bitch named, Sally
To the track with a big fat sack of the crack
And told her don't come back, until she did that
Cause shit was gettin' funky out in the Bay
You couldn't find a good plug, from here to L.A.
Cause niggaz get sheisty and sell you bunk
And no scratch, but these gats, gon' equal funk
You can't be no punk, get slabbed in yo' truck
And roll around town with the beat on pump
Have yo' eardrums leakin' from the beatin' of the series 2's

Who said he knew this fool, said this fool was cool
Said that his daddy was a mason with a major supply
And I can get some thangs as long as I buy 5
I really wasn't trippin' cause I had the cash
But if it goes down funky I'ma smoke yo' ass
Hung up the phone and I was up, put the mill' on the tuck
The speaker-box in the Chevy truck
I'm at the spot a hundred G's, and my strap
I done beeped this fool twice and he ain't call back
Now where he at, schemin' on Legit the Savage
Wanna wrap me up and ride away with the cabbage
Everybody startin' to look like the FBI
I'm hella paranoid dude, but now I'm hella high
It ain't fly for this nigga from the H-I-double-L
With no motherfuckin' dope to sell

I got my mask, whippin' up some dope fast
Or a little mag 57 is a rag
Hydronic ash shit is known to keep the fiends blastin'
Mix together, cook it up on a Bronson burner
Cause that fire have you higher than that Ike Turner
Hours later, it's lookin' good for this player
Oil formed and I just got my third layer
And if it's cool, yo' nigga yellin' fuck the collar
Fo' times my mail, with the sales an hour
Jackin' off my cash, buyin' up hella toys
And all I'm fuckin' with is rich-ass white boys
Took him out the glass but he lookin' dirty white
Washed him off with the acetone to get him right
Who got a light, and when yo' nigga lit the flame
He'll bam-boof with the roof, and e'rythang
Am I to blame, fo' niggaz havin' bad luck?
Too much dirt, is that stoppin' me from comin' up?
Well I don't know, but I'm po' and I need a few

Grew up in the slums wouldn't trade it for shit

Is now on blow and comin' through buyin fat 2-0

Semi-automatic with extended clips 
A chopper every nigga down with my click 
Neighborhood funkin' 
Mail's on slow 
It's barely comin' through 
And all I'm sellin is O's 
I ride high performance when it gets like this 
Electric everything, racing cam and kits 
I'm livin' on the edge but I'm lovin' the high 
I'm either goin' down or I'm goin' die 
Hot ones echo through the geto limp 
Put the tip out the window let the AK spit 
They just caught my homey with a pound of crack 
Plus the other day they said he robbed a bank 
A million dollar bail in his Uncle's own 
All charges got dropped 'cause it's oh so long

The only homey in the hood ridin' on thangs 
And as I peep it thangs have got a little deeper 
And everybody and their Momma done bought a beeper 
And then they post on the lake gettin' loose and wild 
You know the scene it's the ghetto smile 
At 18 I graduated and now I'm grown 
About time for the dog to get his own bone 
I left home got a condo out on Quailridge 
And like a king is how this young playa live 
Swimmin' parties in the pool with my dope to roll 
Wasn't trippin' off nathin' we was all folks 
Hillside in the house and we gettin' perved 
Freestylin' gettin' on my neighbor's nerves 
I love the hood so everyday I'm back to visit 
And swoop the young so that they can come through and kick it 
And peep the game just as I did as a kid 
And watch the savage get his cabbage and place his bid 
And even though we fight we still remain game tight 
Handle business and always open for forgiveness 
It ain't nothin' like a homey you ain't seen in awhile 
So when you meet him greet him with that ghetto smile",Ghetto Smile

We might uh, shoot some pool, play a little dominoes 
Call a few tenders over

You know where I stay 
The V A to the Double L 
The homey flossin in the V-12 
So when you comin' to kick with it 
With the Sick Wid It 
You bring the whole team 
When you hit magazine 
Like the other day a car low from E-P-A 
Came through with some Hennesey and Alize 
I'm on the corner gettin' burnt with the chili mac 
They hit the block in a dark blue ville 'lac 
Wassup wit y'all? 
Nuthin, tryin' to get it jumpin' 
And it's the first can we go to the mall or sumthin'? 
I got to laughin' but now I was pimp the baby(?) 
Lookin' like she want to tongue kiss my Mercedes 
I got a spot where we all can go kick it at 
We got the bomb and y'all got the Cognac 
Don't even trip I got a click and I want you to meet 'em 
Once we make this left we to the Hemp Museum

You ladies help y'all self and pour the do it fluid 
While I break down the pound and manicure it

Tryin to get her out here Donna Karan 
Uh...I'm callin all top notches 
Homies with the rolex 
Watches slide through 
Like the thing to do 
We're all players 
No square be allowed in the house of hemp 
We campaigns like the President 
I got four or five dank rooms 
Big screens with playstations 
Wet bar, perculation 
A vacation? 
No, more like the Mardi Gras 
With hurricanes and thangs that you ain't ever saw

And we can meet at the Denny's up at ???ville 
But as for now your playa patna gettin' hot

Two niggas stuck and we start to sit
Case hella weak, got to dismiss shit
I threw the words with the fish like swiiiss
I only dealt on y'all 'cause i had some warrants
Tell you to a player on some tickets and toys
I never had a bad case, check my fat on that

Then I let a nigga out on house arrest
I break from the game, got a nigga change

B-Legit,"Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters, now I see

I'm in the house, about six, twist the lit
I park my V Hic, feedin' my bitch
They wonder if I switched since I signed my deal
I'm legit, I'm deep up in this game for real

The bars of steel, I got the black gate
Twin 38s just to keep things straight
I'm late for everything, money is joy
I run the rap game like a ol' D boy

I can rock gator boots an' wear K Swiss
Put the diamonds on my pinky, watch on my wrist
I'll tell you like this, the G's gon' sag
Wit some real freem in my bag
An' it goes like this, like this

Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

I'm in the wind, 600 Benz up in the traffic
My rims, reals girls in, it's like magic, it's drastic
Tryin' to live the life that I live
I rap P.I. an' stay high as I need

I'm a factor, brought in a rapper, I'm from the game
Legit is the name, the mo' skrilla the fame
In the train, all in Seattle where it rains
You can buy my slang, I'm from the Bay, mayne

A rap star piece, I'm a beast on the mic
It's ten, I'll creep up in by midnight
You can check my rap site, B-Legit.com
An' it tell you that, “Yo boy, he the bomb”

Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

Make way, a brand new day, so peep the boss
It's true when I come through, so tear it off
It cost, so we all kick it an' ball
An' talk about the platinum an' gold on the wall

I'm a savage, ain't nobody bad like me
Got people from the Bay all the way to D.C.
Ask the boy R P an' K R E D
About a hog, out the valley named Legitimate B

I'm a mac, I rap on special request
Call me Superman without the cape an' the 'S'
I'm from the hillside an' plan to hold that down
So let me know when you fools hit the westbound

I'm feelin' like I got the whole world in my hands
Gator boots on the feet for the limpin'
Sophisticated, high classy
If you gonna have it, have it lavish

Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

Into my destiny, now I see

Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me

In and out of ports keep secret files
First peep the smile, then flash the wrist
Diamonds get them pissy when it's stashed like this
On a flash like this, according to the script
Hoes do the choosin', a boss he flipped
I skipped from Peru, went straight to the map
Them boys from the Bay and all day we be at it

Yea, we fly first class, touch down like pimps
What's the next event, tell me what town it's in
I'll see ya there man, I always do
I had some good weed, some hoes too
What the feinin' for, give it too'em
All around the world we get to do'em
When I'm on vacation everyday I fuck
Bad bitches see a player, wanna lay up

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

I run into my folks, nothin's too far
Got a few breezies, gettin' drunk at the bar
I don't care where I'm at, I'll make ya girl share that
I step in the room she recognize a player mack
Known for my raps, gettin' blown in the back
Gimme 10 G's a microphone and some 'Yak
And don't forget my Kahlua and Baliey's
Look and learn, don't ask me what I'll do to ya lady

Now what I'll do to ya lady, I'll do to ya life
Come through, break you, get out with my stripes
Pipe down big dog, ain't no need to be soar
'Cuz I'll I'm comin' for is the Christian Dior
Catch ya boy off shore, candy bars in the store
Forever papered up but they handed me more
Did Twins in Minnesota at the All-Star Break
Bounced all accross state on them concert dates

Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

Handcuff'em now, you know we comin' to town
No, we don't smoke brown but we do shoot rounds
Green 16's over Rick Rock sounds
Call me flip flop now, mix yellow and brown
Korean, European, know they all get down
Muslims get the money, man, I'll see you in Guam
I'm there 2 weeks need freaks and bomb

We knocked these grey girls from Oregon
They had a flight to catch early in the mornin' to Portland
It doesn't matter where ya from, baby
It's the last line, we can have some fun, maybe
Me and B-La, yea, we got jungle fever
But it's all about the money with us
We don't want ya people to think we discrimanatin'
Can't make the pimpin' wait
I spit a lil' game then I listen to what women say

Benehmen uns oft daneben wenn wir bloß einen drehen,

G.B.Z. und A.G.G.R.O Berlin,

raucht das dickste Gras und werd' alles überfliegen.
Deine Chick du Spast ist das, wo alle drauf liegen,
Frauen mit dickem Arsch, ist das, was echte Kerle Lieben,

Aggro Berlin Mutterficker, represent den Shit,
hier kommt die Posses der Posses für den Neger Bobby Dick.
Ihr seid Pussys, Pussys ihr seid so niedlich,
ihr geht 8 Tage in den Knast und denkt ihr seid wie ich.
Ich bin Kontrovers, kontro Vers
ich komm' mach ein Kind, was mein Konto erbt.
Ich wieg' 100 Kilo ich spuck' wie ein Panzer,
der Index abonniert meine Hits wie Landser.
Ihr macht alle Schwulenpop, keiner pumpt den Schrott im Block.
Ghetto Kiddies rasten aus und feiern MOK den Hip-Hop Schock.

Meine Stahlhand zerschlägt deinen Kopf,
die Parkbank ist für mich nur ein Stock.
Deine Schrankwand zerreiß' ich wie einen Katalog,
Tony Damager schreit dich an und du bist 
Vorsicht du, ich hab mein Ohr nicht eine Sekunde weg von dir,
ich krieg' alles mit.
Ich weiß du redest Shit soviel wie wenn es regnet,
du gehst jetzt anschaffen soviel wie ein Mercedes.
Mein Rap ist Hardcore und nichts Edles,
doch mein Geschmack ist das teuerste ich nehm' es.
Tony D zerstört jedes Ziel
ohne ihn,
wär' Berlin (nein), nicht so aggressiv.

Mein Penis, mein Penis ist dick,
komm' wenn du willst dann wirst du gefickt. 
Ganz Deutschland findet mich zu strange,
meine Tapes haben Strassenfame.
Rap top, Laptop, My Space.com,
schreib' mich an und kauf' 'nen Song.
E-Mail, mein Geschäft das boomt,
warum chillen, es gibt viel zu tun.
Fotzen ficken und Scheine zählen,
daraus besteht mein ganzes Leben.
A.doppel G.R.O Berlin und Berlin Crime, sind ein Team.

Ich bin der Rapper im Spiel,
vor dem ihr Optik kriegt.
jetzt wird dein Kopf gefickt,
G-Hot und Bobby Dick.
Ich krieg' jetzt tausende Anrufe, weil ich viel Geld mache,
mein Handy klingelt jetzt öfters als Bill Gates Kasse.
Die Frauen lieben mich wie Kobe Bryant.
Jetzt ist jeder nett jeder will mein Homie sein.
Dich fässt keine Bitch an dich findet jede Ranz,
du hast kein Sex du hast nur ein Spinnwebenschwanz.
Mit mir will jede Ficken,
wegen meinen bösen Blicken
Sie sind krank nach mir und kriegen wie Vögelgrippe.
Sie wollen morgens meine Eier und mittags meine Wurst,
ich bin ein Star und heb' ab wie ein heisser Furz.

Ich hab kein Geld, doch dafür ein paar Anzeigen,
Papa hat gesagt, wenn ich was will, dann soll ich dran bleiben.
Ich rapp' für viel Kohle für viele Hoes und dicke Ketten,
ich will 'ne Villa mit 10 Zimmern und 10 Toiletten.
Ich habe oft getickt, den Bitches auf 'n Bauch gespritzt,
ich war so schlau und hab' sogar die Kripo ausgetrickst.
Ich bin ein Gehttokind und muss ab und zu untertauchen,
ihr könnt mich unterschätzen doch niemals für dumm verkaufen.
Ich bin einer der dran bleibt,
mit Kampfgeist,
präsentiere Sektenmuzik und dazu die besten Punchlines.
Während ich texte, lass' ich mir gern' auch einen blazen,
Alpa Gun für B-Tight auf dem Beat von Tai Jason.

Bogy der Atzenkeeper der erste rappende Dealer,
Berlin Crime, Aggro Berlin wir sind eine Famillia.
Ich habe 46 Fieber und die Temperatur steigt,
es liegt in meiner Natur ich bin extrem Gewaltbereit.
Atzen kommen mit B-Tight und der Rest vom Team Mok,
das is der Abschaum-City-Rock für den Kiez und den Block.
Ich hab' kein Bock auf 'nen Job,
Husteln ist meine Ambition,
ich will ein Haus und 'ne Million wie der Atze Dieter Bohlen.
In der Stadt, wo ich wohne da sind Dämonen zu hause,
sie bedrohen mein Leben kleben an mir ohne Pause.
Atze ich fluche und rauche und haue meine Bitch,
das ist hart aber Standard,
wir sind Abschaum City Kids.

Ich bin der Rapper den deine Freundin gern hätte,
doch ich poppe keine Grotte aber bomb' dich wie 'ne Flotte.
Wenn ich kiffe dann kiff' ich die Killermatte,
ich bin der Killer, der Killer,
du hälst die Backen.
Guck' ich bin ein Deutscher mit Schwarzkopf,
wenn du denkst du bist besser dann leck' mein Arschloch.
Jeden der kommt um zu batteln man den, den zerfetz' ich.

Sie brauchen Instrumente zum blasen.
Sie leckt an mir rum, als wär' ich ein Chupa Chups.
Sie macht immer weiter, sie will meinen Zuckerguss.
Wie wechseln ab, mal bin ich und mal ist sie der Boss.
Am Ende ext sie meinen Saft wie Tequila Shots.
Egal ob Lack und Leder, Fessel -oder Rollenspiele.
Ich stoß in ihre Höhle als wär' es 'ne Goldmine.
Ich bin jetzt geil, liebe ihren Sex-Style.
Ich soll den Tanga zerreißen, er soll zerfetzt sein.

Ich mach den Martini auf.
Ich gib's ihr wie sie 's brauch,
aber sie mir auch.
Sie ist eine die mein Herz sein kann,
und ihr Arsch ist so prall das man Berg steigen kann.

Sie will erst die Fleischflöte spielen, da sag ich nicht nein!
Es macht Ding-Dong ich lass ihre Glocken läuten.
Vom Regen in die Traufe. Sie wird nicht mehr trocken heute!
Und es geht: rein, raus.Rein, raus.Rein, raus!
Und die Nachbarn hören es laut!

Erst wenn sie auf mir sitzt, dann beweg' ich mich!
Sie fässt mich an, genau da wo ich's gern hab. 
Sie küsst ihn, frisst ihn auf, sie will immer mehr Saft.
Sie steht auf den harten Style und softes Vorspiel.
Ist egal was sie braucht, ich besorg's ihr!
Es bleibt zwischen uns, ich werd es bestimmt nicht sagen.
Sie fühlt sich frei, nur bei mir wird sie zur Nymphomanin!
Sie zerreißt mein T-Shirt, sie ist verrückt nach mir.
Sie interessiert nur mein bestes Stück.
Ist OK, es ist das was sie braucht, sie ist das was ich brauch'.

Es ist Bobby Dick
Die Szene kriegt ein Bodycheck
Alle halten ihre Fresse
Solange wie Bobby rappt
Leute haben viel zu fragen
Doch ich hab nicht viel zu sagen
Geh mir auf'n Sack und du landest tot
In 'nem Lieferwagen
Halt die Fresse
Rapp ist mein Gebiet
Mein Kietz
Kein Bief
Hat mich je gefickt und wird es auch nie
Ich mache Geld wie ein Ticker
Du wie ein Stricher
Ich bin ein Ficker
Ein Schicker
Und manchmal auch ein Zücker
Ich hab Viel
Doch ich brauch Viel Viel mehr
Kauf meine Platte ich brauch deine Patte
Ich kriege viele Geschenke von Leuten die denken
Sie müssten meine Freunde sein
Alles klar hauste rein

Ich bin's
Der Junge aus'm Keller der jetzt endlich mal nach oben will
Bobby Dick
Ah!
Der Junky aus der Gosse der jetzt noch mehr Drogen will
Ich bin's
Der coolste Ficker der coolste halb Neger digger
Bobby Dick
Haa ich bin's
Ah!

Es geht alles um Timing
Und mein Ding
Mit dem ich tief in deine Kehle eindring'
Bobby Dick is' königlich
Außergewöhnlich schön
Und ich vögel' dich aber nur wenn deine Muschi edel ist
Ich regel' mein Leben ohne nach Regeln zu leben
Ich bin umgeben von toten,
Elenden Idioten
Rap ist ein Marathon keiner bleibt an mir dran
Ich bin einer von wenigen Rappern den keiner ficken kann
Vom Junky zum Rapper
Vom Rapper zum Boss
Und bald Millionär alta
Was will man mehr alta
Lange Nächte lange Tage
Was ich will das kann ich haben
Was ich will das nehm' ich mir das hab ich aus der Gegend hier
Rapper können nichts gegen mich sagen
Aber versuchen es
Blamieren sich
Und verfluchen mich
Es wird peinlich für dich wenn du mein Feind bist
Kein Witz ich seh' schon wie du dich vor mir einpisst
Ich bin arrogant mache was keiner kann
Guck mich an
Hirn verbrannt
Mich feiert das ganze Land
Sie tragen mich auf Händen
Wenn ich Stage-Dive

Bounce, come on

Doch sie schreien laut,
Wer hat das Gras weg geraucht

Du siehst hart aus doch,
In deinem Loch sind mehr schwänze,
Als Autos im Parkhaus
Viele wollen mich dissen,
Wollen ein Stück von mir,
Doch alles was sie kriegen ist mein Dicken, hier
Viele können kaum rappen, aber tun so
Für diese Wichser hab ich einfach nur ein Hurensohn
Alle machen Hektik
Ich gehe es ruhig an
Ich nehm' wir was vor
Und das tu ich dann
Hater werden Fans
Spießer wollen Ghetto sein
Bräute wollen ihre Muschi an meiner Kette reiben

Du hast Probleme wenn du mir sagen willst das geht nicht. 
Andere Rapper wünschten sich, dass der Neger in Ketten wäre 
Doch ich hol' mein Schwanz raus und erweise dir die letzte Ehre, 
Nicht so hastig diss mich hass mich, doch mein Rap ist Fantastisch, 
Du denkst du kannst mich aufhalten, man verpiss dich ist nicht lass mich. 
Du fragst dich was das ist (Hä) Die Rapper mit schmackes ,
Ich sag wir sind Nummer eins ihr wisst das es Fakt ist, 
Ich hab kein Problem, alles läuft wie geschmiert ich hab Deutsch im Visier. 
Du hältst dich für das Perfekte und schwebst auf Wolke 7 
Hast dich so reingesteigert, dass du denkst du könntest fliegen. 
Das ist die Realität finde dich damit ab, 
Wärst du nur besser gewesen hätt' es vielleicht geklappt. 
Ich hab es satt mich die ganze Zeit beruhigen zu müssen 
Wegen Neidern die dissen und letztendlich meinen Arsch küssen. 
Rap ist ein Rondel, egal wohin du gehst 
Bleibst du auf der selben stelle bis du völlig untergehst. 
Ich sehe keine Probleme dich einfach auszulöschen, 
Dafür zu sorgen dass die Menschen deinen Namen vergessen, 
Ich bin von Rap besessen kann ihm nicht widerstehen, 
Für mich bist du kein Problem also auf wiedersehen.

Es ist der Neger der jetzt doppelt so viel Welle schiebt,
Es ist der Neger wenn du aus dem dunkel links 'ne Schelle kriegst,
Es ist er den die meisten andren Neger hassen,
Doch wegen ihm stehen die Bräute jetzt auf Negerlatten,
Er wird gefeiert wie kein zweiter,
Er feiert sich am meisten,
Sobald er Titten sieht kriegt er ein' steifen,
Er steht auf große Mädchen mit blondierten Strähnchen,
Doch nichts geht über frittiertes Hähnchen,
Leute fragen ihn ständig ob er noch Gras habe,
Er sagt „nein"", doch zieht hinter sich 'ne Grasfahne,
Er hat große Muskeln, er sieht gut aus,
Er ist intelligenter als man ihm zutraut,

Es ist der Neger der mit seinem Aussehen Kohle scheffelt,
Der auf dem Thron sitzt und seine Krone festhält,
Er hat viele Schwarze Brüder, Weiße und auch Schwarze Gegner,
Doch ist egal, im Enddefekt ist er der Wahre Neger,
Ob Dreadlocks oder Glatze, Bitches halten ihre Pussy hin wie eine Katze,
Man sieht ein blitzen in den Augen wenn sie ihn sehen,
Und ihre Herzen hämmern und der Raum wird dann zum Chiemsee,
Er hat die Nase voll, er hat die Lunge voll,
Er dreht und dreht, das passiert ganz ungewollt,
Er ist extrem chillig doch mach kein Stress mit ihm,
Sein zweites Gesicht bring alles zum eskalieren,

Es war der Neger wenn dein Ticker plötzlich nichts mehr hat,
Früher waren es Zehner teile, heut' kauft er den ganzen Sack,
Es ist der Neger der Buchstaben mit den Fingern macht,
„AGGRO"", japp das ist er immer noch,
Gib ihm höchstens Zehn Minuten mit 'ner Braut und sie kaut,
Während er ein baut und ihre Matten klaut,
Seine Augen sind immer Rot wie ein Laserpointer,
Er fickt jede Braut auch wenn sie ein „Zwei Meter Freund"" hat,
Man sagt er hätte Zehn Kinder mit verschiedenen Frauen,
Und egal was er sagt, man darf ihm nie vertrauen,
Doch alle wollt Tanzen wie er,
Crunken wie er,
Ihr wisst von wem ich rede,
Es ist der „Neger"",

Rap mir was vor doch ich hör mir nicht dein Scheiß an
Denn jedes Mal kommst du mir mit dem selben Scheiß an

Stehst du hinter mir wie ein Mann, 
Renn' ich ins Messer dich fässt niemand an.
Entscheide denkst du wie ich, 
Oder verkaufst du mich für den Banger einer Bitch. (Uh)
Für Lügen hab ich kein Verständnis, ich verfüge über Menschenkenntnis.
Ich schenke immer reinen Wein ein, ich hab ein großes Herz es kann hart wie Stein sein.
Ich verkaufe meine Seele an den Teufel, 
Wenn es ein Freund will, wenn es ein Freund will.

Ich geb' mein bestes für dich, wenn ich weiß es ist für dich.
Fang ich 'ne Kugel für dich, glaub mir ich tu es für dich.
Riskier' mein Leben für dich, vergieße Tränen für dich,
Kannst du ein Opfer nicht bringen, halte ich mein Kopf für dich hin.

Ich weiß noch wie es war, schule machte viel Spaß
Dann fing ich zu kiffen an, und alles war für'n Arsch
Zu hause lief es meistens schlecht, der Tisch von dem ich aß war selten reich gedeckt
Für Spielzeuge hab ich Pfennige zusammen gekratzt
Ich kannte es nicht anders, es hat mich nicht angekotzt
Es war für mich normal, ich hatte ja auch nicht die Wahl
Ab und zu konnte Mama die Stromrechnung nicht bezahlen
Wir hatten nur Kerzenlicht, doch ich hab's einfach hingenommen
Die Familie hielt zusammen, zusammen haben wir es hinbekommen
Doch ab und zu verloren wir unseren halt
Mama an der Flasche, alles droht zu zerfallen
Das Jugendamt machte immer Stress
Ich habe es gehasst, es nahm mich immer weg
Weit weg von Mama, in irgend so ein Kinderheim
Auch wenn da viel los war, ich fühlte mich immer allein

Ein zimmer, Ofenheizung, Außenklo und keine dusche
Ich hab mit Mäusen gehaust, Scheiße gebaut, war fast immer scheiße drauf
Ich hab mir die Wohnung mit Sido geteilt, das reine Chaos, wir waren übelst verpeilt
Doch eins haben wir geschafft, wir verkauften Kassetten
Zuerst Stück für Stück und dann ganze Paletten
Die Sekte war im Untergrund die Nummer eins
Die Sekte, bis heute noch unerreicht
Wir haben Beats auf der Playstation produziert
Wir haben ganz Rapdeutschland provoziert
Endlich floß Geld, das war Grund einen zu heben
Ein paar hundert Mark waren für uns ein vermögen
Dann kam Specter mit großen Visionen, er wollte mit uns bis ganz nach oben

Und alle wollten uns als gebe es ein Kopfgeld
Und auf einmal hatte ich nur noch Stars um mich
Auf Aftershowparties lief „Neger bums mich""
Ich lernte alle kennen, von Otto bis 50Cent
Und wer nicht weiß wer ich bin, der lernt mich jetzt kennen
Mein erstes Video kannte jeder, alle Plattenbosse im Land schrien „Der Neger""
Und dann wurde es Aggro Berlin zeit, hunderttausend Verkäufe zu meiner Zufriedenheit
Komisch, damals war ich ein niemand, für den sich niemand interessiert hat
Heute gibt es so viele kleine Gerüchte, scheiß' drauf, denn ich schreibe Geschichte

Sie begleitet mich auf all´ mein Wegen.
So wird es immer sein,

Als wär' sie eine fette Sau.

Sie hat den besten Sound.
Sie hat die beste Kick, die besten Sner,
Die besten Streicher.

Ein Teil von mir.

Ich kleide sie, feile sie,
Geb' ihr die richtige Atmosphäre.
Ich brauch keine Luft, ich brauch kein Rauch,
Sie füllt meine Atemwege.

Sie gibt mir was ich brauch.

Ich kenne diese Braut. Sie liebt diesen Kerl,
Doch der Kerl ist vergeben hat Kinder und führt 'ne Ehe
Er lebt wie im Paradies, er ist der Herr des Hauses
Und das stinkt dieser Braut wie ein Pferdehaufen.
Sie will ihn ganz für sich, sie ärgert sich.
Für ihn wars 'n Fick, für sie Liebe auf 'n ersten Blick.
Er hat ihr tausendmal gesagt, dass er sie nicht liebt.
Sie ist 'n bisschen verrückt, sie glaubt, dass er sie belügt.
Sie beobachtet ihn, sie ist eifersüchtig.
Und seine Schlampe von Frau die ist zweigesichtig.
Sie hat ihn gar nicht verdient und die Kinder,
Das sind Bastarde. Die sind noch viel schlimmer!
Eines nachts kommt sie unbemerkt ins Haus rein,
Sie tötet alle, denn sie will seine Frau sein.
Nur ihn streichelt sie genüsslich,
Sie flüstert pscht, ab heute sind wir glücklich.

Dieses Leid zu begreifen war schwer, denn er war noch klein.
Er konnte nicht verstehen weswegen seine Mama weint,
Doch er weinte mit, denn er spürte sie von ganz allein,
Immer wenn sein Vater nachts nach Haus kam um sie anzuschreien.
Am nächsten Tag war Mama grün und blau,
Sie hat nichts gesagt doch sie sah übel aus.
Einfach so zu gehen hätt' sie sich nie getraut,
Arm wie sie war für ihren Sohn nahm sie den Typ in kauf.
Er hatte Geld aber schlug gerne zu.
OB besoffen oder nicht, denn es war Blut an seinen Schuhen.
Sein Junge wurde älter, aus der Angst wurde Hass
Und die tränen sind getrocknet nein er bangt nicht mehr nachts
Er liegt jetzt wach in seinen Bett mit der Brechstange.
Und wartet bis sein Alter brüllt, dauerte lange,
Dann rennt er auf Ihn zu und schreit du ehlendiges Schwein
Holt aus, „Und schlägt ihm die Schädeldecke ein.""

Er war ein ordentlicher Junge, er war ein Junge aus der Kleinstadt,
Doch Mama musste ackern in Berlin, was er geil fand.
Also zog er hinterher mit Papa kam er nicht so klar,
Mama war ihm wichtiger es sollte sein wie es mal war,
Schon am ersten Tag in Berlin auf den Straßen,
Sah er aggressive Blicke und hörte eine menge Sprachen
Die ihm fremd waren, er lernte schnell was das heißt,
Als Deutscher in der Minderheit hier zu leben ist nicht leicht.
Keiner hat ihn akzeptiert, er war nur das deutsche Opfer.
Und schnell hat er nicht reagiert, also kamen die Leute nochmal.
Und noch mal, immer wieder und wieder.
Mama konnte ihm nicht helfen, sie war nie da, wenn es ihm zu viel war
Hmmmm, sein Hass hat sich aufgestaut.
Er nimmt Papas Jagdgewehr und rennt im Wahn aus dem Haus
Bis an die Ecke in einem Trip von Sekunden.
Er brachte alle zur Strecke „Ja, wer hat sein Glück gefunden""

Pausenlos Junge haben Shit verkaufen es auf'm Hof
Ich wollte leben wie die große Fische
Doch wie es aussieht hatte mich der Sensemann schon auf der Todesliste
Ich war berauscht von der grüne Medizin
Gestopft in einer Bong und ich liebte's es sie zu ziehen
Es fing schon früh an, hier kriegst du's in jeder Ecke
Doch ich wär' nicht ich wenn mein Viertel keine Fehler hätte
Ich hab gelernt auszuteilen und auch einzustecken
Und das es feige ist jemand in's Bein zu stechen
Ich hab nie eingesessen, man hat mich nicht erwischt
Ich kann auch hart sein doch Knast wäre nicht's für mich
Mein Weg bis hierher war schwer doch es stärkt mich
Dank ihm werd' ich, mit fast alles fertig
Meine Gegend die ist hart aber herzlich
Merk' ich das Viertel ist darum mein Herzes

Könnt' ich mein Leben von vorne leben dann würd' ich
Es genau so machen auch wenn ich weiß es ist hart
Auch wenn man zwischendurch mal abgestürzt ist
Alles was dich nicht umbringt macht dich stark

Könnt' ich mein Leben von vorne leben dann würd' ich

Man kann hier leben nur leider nich jeden Tag geniessen
Musst du öfters kämpfen doch ich bin bis heute stark geblieben
Bist du ein niemand lassen sie dich auf der Straße liegen
Hier gibt es zu viele Jugendliche die ein harten schieben
Wollen sie dein Handy haben, dann leiste Widerstand
Tust du das was sie dir sagen kommen sie immer wieder an
Ich mein du musst dich wären das hier ist nur eine Lehre
Statt ein Hund zu sein kassiere lieber wie ein Mann die Schläge Canim
Es war nicht leicht bis heute, jetzt kenn' ich reiche Leute
Ich mach' hier mein Ding und verwirkliche nur meine Träume
Ich steh' auf kleine Bräute, rap' nicht nur für große Scheine
Jeder weiß, dass ich bescheiden bin und auf'm Boden bleibe
Ich hab gelernt dankbar zu sein und ohne Furcht zu kämpfen
Menschen haben verlernt sich zu bedanken und sich durchzusetzen
Die Straße ist nichts für Kinder und nichts für schwache Nerven
So lebe ich hier und werde irgendwann als Kanacke sterben

Es ist hart im Block, jeden Tag im Block
Das Leben, was ich führte was schwierig
Aber ich bereu' nichts von dem was passiert ist
Das Leben ist eben eins des härtestens
Zu viele Opfer scheißen drauf und werfen es hin
Ich hab' mich angestrengt, ich hab die Kurve gekriegt
Ich hab gekämpft und rutschte so in mein Glück

Was mich auf den Beinen hält ist meine Heimatliebe
Du hältst es hier nicht lange durch wie eine Eintagsfliege
Nenn' mich dein Vater Junge nein du bist kein harte Bursche
Deswegen kann es sein, dass ich auf dich und dein Partner furze

Ich will meine Frau umarmen und immer wieder Sex,
Ich will meine Karriere noch weiter ausbauen,
Tausend Alben raushauen und davon ein Haus bauen,
Ich will meine Eltern noch mal sagen ich Liebe euch,
Ich hoffe ihr wart nicht so oft von mir enttäuscht,
Ich will Siggi noch sagen das er mein bester Freund ist,
Das kein Wort beschreiben kann was er für mich bedeutet,
Oh Gott ich will noch so vieles im Leben sehen,
Du kannst mir nicht dieses Leben nehmen,

Ich geh was essen oder Klopapier kaufen, dann kommen die Leute laufend an
Stören und wollen ein Autogramm.
Und die Medien reden schlecht über mich,
Der Paparazzi sitzt versteckt im Gebüsch.
All die dicken Bonzen chillen in ihren großen Häusern
Und hassen mich weil ich Erfolg hab so ist Deutschland.
Wenn du berühmt bist will jeder bald ein Stück von dir,
Deshalb wünsch' ich mir mein Schaukelpferd zurück zu mir.
Ich würd' so gern so naiv und blind wie ein Kind sein.
Ich such ein Grund erwachsen zu sein doch ich find' kein.

Seit dem ich ein Star bin sieht die Welt für mich anders aus
Ich muss genau gucken wen ich was anvertrau'.
Alle lächeln viel, doch das ist nur schlecht gespielt
Und die fragen mich warum ich so 'ne Fresse zieh?
Man, ich stumpfe immer mehr ab
Mein lachen ist schon lange nicht mehr herzhaft.
Ich hab gelernt wie hinterlistig Menschen sein können,
Wie sie dir Erfolg wünschen obwohl sie dir keinen gönnen.
Manchmal denk ich über alles nach und glaub ich werd' verrückt
Und dann wünsch' ich mir mein Schaukelpferd zurück.
Ich will die Welt wieder in Ordnung sehen,
Ich möchte ein Tag lang ohne Sorgen leben.

Manchmal seh' ich so gern meine Welt durch Kinderaugen
Und wünschte ich könnt euch glauben, wie ein Kind.
Und manchmal hätt' ich auch gern,
Jemand der mein kaltes Herz wieder aufwärmt
Und den Druck von mein Schultern nimmt, wie ein Kind.

Als Kind ist alles leichter, das Leben war so einfach
Als man noch nicht gemerkt hat
Das Mama nachts geweint hat
Man hat nur Spaß gehabt
Hat so in den Tag gelebt.
Ich fand's nicht schlimm das der Mann da auf der Straße schläft.
Als Kind geht's immer aufwärts, man muss noch lernen zu fallen.
Mama hat versucht das schlechte immer von mir fernzuhalten.
Ich hatte schöne Träume, hatte einen festen Schlaf
Auch wenn's kein Strom gab war immer was zu essen da.
Ich hab die Schule gehasst, ich war nur selten da,
Dann gab's von Mama immer Kellen nach dem Elterntag.
Doch mach mir das nicht nach, lern' was, ich rat's dir
Das bisschen Mathe ist ein Witz gegen Hartz IV.

Als Kind ist alles leichter,
Auch wenn wir nicht grade reich waren.
Mama gab ihr bestes doch ist auch mal gescheitert.
Aber sie war sehr geschickt, denn ich merkte nicht,
Das ihr Herz Tag für Tag immer mehr zerbricht.
Sie passte auf das meine Welt immer heil blieb,
Das ihr Sohn immer sorgenfrei einschlief.
Als Kind brauch man wenig zum Glücklich sein,
Hauptsache die Eltern lassen einen nicht allein.
Für meine Kinder werd' ich einfach alles tun,
Ich gebe ihnen wärme das Leben ist schon kalt genug.
Wenn meine Kinder fallen helfe ich ihnen aufzustehen,
Dank ihnen kann ich wieder wie aus Kinderaugen sehen.

Manchmal seh' ich so gern meine Welt durch Kinderaugen
Und wünschte ich könnt euch glauben, wie ein Kind.
Und manchmal hätt' ich auch gern
Jemand der mein kaltes Herz wieder aufwärmt
Und den Druck von mein Schultern nimmt, wie ein Kind.

Manchmal seh' ich so gern meine Welt durch Kinderaugen
Und wünschte ich könnt euch glauben, wie ein Kind.
Und manchmal hätt' ich auch gern

Manchmal wär' ich wieder gern ein Kind,

Manchmal wär' ich wieder gern ein Kind,

Du hast dein Shirt zerfetzt und du willst noch mehr vor Wut zerreißen,

Denn du willst mir sagen wie ich zu leben habe,
Dann komm worauf warten?
Zeig mir aus welcher Welt du bist?
Ich spuck auf sie, deine Gesetze gelten nicht.

B-Tight,"Ich hörte ihn das erste mal auf Westberliner Kassetten
Er und sido, die Sekte, mir gefiel wie sie rappten
'nen ziemlich verdreckten Sound, doch sie gaben keinen Fick, Nein
Brachten in den Laden frischen Wind rein
Wurd' grad so entdeckt, bei Royal Bunker
Aber als ich ankam, war er schon weg
Es war Schade für Ek, denn ich feierte den B-Tight
Doch ich war bei Optik, wo ich erstmal 'ne EP schreib
Es war ein Geniestreich - KvD
Und Aggro war mir damals viel zu hart drauf, ey
Ich weiß noch, ich saß grad bei Viva und machte mir nen Lenz
Da kamen die Jungs rein und ich dachte, Scheiße, harte Konkurrenz

Damals hab ich ihn gefeiert, für den König von Deutschland
Endlich mal was freshes, was echtes unter den Heuchlern
Für mich ging's immer weiter, Aggro ging durch die Decke
Mein Ego ist gewachsen, mein Gewissen blieb auf der Strecke
Ich steckte mein ganzes Geld in Weiber und Drogen
Meine Realität hat sich reichlich verbogen
Ich dachte es war mein Turn, als ich die Abrechnung hörte
Ek macht jetzt Gangsterrap. Es passt nicht, es störte
Es war wie Krieg, ich verteidigte mein Gebiet, alles auf Sieg
Es war logisch, dass ich eine Antwort schrieb
Statements auf MTV, so nahm der Beef seinen Lauf
Ein persönliches Gespräch, blieb leider aus

Ey yo, Ek Ey yo, B-Tight
Ist der ganze Scheiß, wirklich schon so lange her
Ey yo, B-Tight Ey yo, Ek
Beef ist in, doch wir laufen nicht der Mode hinterher

Ey yo, Ek Ey yo, B-Tight
Auch wenn's manche Leute, einfach nicht verkraften
Ey yo, B-Tight Ey yo, Ek
Früher waren wir Feinde, heute sind wir Atzen

Es war das Ziel, was du brauchst, alle hauten auf mich ein
Außer B-Tight, aber trotzdem baute ich ihn ein
In die Abrechnung. Damals war der Teufel los
Er nannt' mich Eule, den Shit bin ich bis heut' nicht los
Dabei hatten wir nicht wirklich ein Problem
Auch Billy meinte, du und Bobby würdet euch verstehen
Auf dem falschen Weg, wollte mit paar Gangster Homies Angst verbreiten
Auf dem Comet, wollt mir Tony seine Hand nicht reichen
Ich war sauer, auf Aggro und die ganze Welt
Warum war mein Hype vorbei? Doch das lag nur an mir selbst
Jahre später, lernten wir uns doch mal kennen
Der ist ja garnicht so, mitten auf der Wok WM

Ich wusste, er wird da sein, aber nicht wie es sein wird
Hat der ganze Beef von damals, überhaupt noch einen Wert (Nö)
Die Zeiten sind vorbei, genug Stress gehabt
Eine ruhige Kugel schieben, ist was man am besten macht
Es war ein versöhnliches Gespräch, aber distanziert
Doch aus den Augen, wollte man sich auch nicht verlieren
Ich holte mir 'ne Band, ich war raus aus dem Hiphop-Film
Und so kamen wir für ein paar Jahre, wieder nicht zum chillen
Ich bahnte mir den Weg durch die Medien
Heutzutage macht man sich Gedanken um den Lebensfilm
Und im Grunde wollen wir alle doch das Gleiche
Auf irgendeine Weise, raus aus der Scheiße

Früher waren wir Feinde, heute sind wir Atzen

Was ein chilliger Dude, das hier tut mir gut
Bobby brach das Eis, zwischen mir und der Juice
Irgendwie ist zwischen uns 'ne große Sympathie
Und er machte Peace, zwischen mir und Tony D
Unser nächstes Treffen war direkt sehr vertraut
Und jetzt werden Freundschaften, nicht mehr verbaut
Was die Zukunft bringt, dass weiß keiner genau
Aber wir steigen auf, so wie ein Astronaut
Der Türke in mir, ist wie der Neger in mir
B-Tight und Ek, wer hat schon ein Leben wie wir
Wir sind erwachsen jetzt, ihr Kiddies, das ist so
Übelste Revival. Siggie, wo bist du?
So schließt sich der Kreislauf, viele sind heiß auf
Beef. Aber Peace, ist mir weitaus lieber
Für mein heutiges Leben, weitaus realer
Ich seh nur nach vorne, also scheiß mal auf früher
Jeder, der das hatet, ist ein riesen Faggot
Deshalb holen wir den dick raus - Evil Jared
Ihr müsst mal über euer Ego spring'
Berlin und Köln, feiern jetzt das Retro Ding

Wieder was neues von den zwei alten Säcken
Wir rappen seit den glorreichen Zeiten der Kassetten
Damals vertickten wir die Dinger auf der Straße
Da habt ihr noch gespielt, mit dem Finger in der Nase
Wir haben die Texte noch mit Stiften auf Papier geschrieben
Die ganzen Jahre sind wir hier geblieben, fest gewachsen
Und ihr seid mit uns aufgewachsen
Ihr wart zwölf, als wir die erste Platte draußen hatten
Ihr wolltet es auch so machen
Aufdrehen, auf die Welt 'n Haufen kacken
Schwanz raus holen und einfach laufen lassen
Doch dann sieht man mit der Zeit
Ihr werdet niemals sein wie Sido und B-Tight
Halleluja, Amen

Weißte noch, wie du die ersten Tapes gekauft hast?
Play gedrückt, mitgerappt, du dachtest, dass du's drauf hast
Schauplatz war dein Kinderzimmer vor dem großen Spiegel
Du wolltest dich so cool wie deine Idole fühlen
Reden wie ein Asi, bloß nicht auf die Eltern hören
Du wolltest zerficken, deine perfekte Welt zerstören
Du wärst so gern ein Ghettokind, dann hättest du was zu erzählen
Rappen wie A.i.d.S. Und ein paar schlechte Rapper quälen
Denn bei uns sieht das alles so leicht aus
Nimm einfach alles, was dir wichtig ist und scheiß drauf
Aber was dahinter steckt, wirst du leider nie peilen
Geh mal weiter spielen, weil ,wie wir wirst du nie sein

Heutzutage tust du so, als wenn wir krasse Feinde wären
Wir zerbröseln dich, als wenn du Gras in unser'm Grinder wärst
Dich nimmt keiner Ernst, keiner, der was zu sagen hat
Wir lachen dich aus, wenn dir der Kragen platzt
Alles easy, alles locker, bei uns sieht alles so chillig aus
Du siehst, was wir haben und sagst will ich, will ich, will ich auch
Aber unseren Weg nach oben hättest du nie durchgehalten
A.i.d.S., du hast Recht, wenn du sagst, dass wir durchgeknallt sind
Vom cracksüchtigen zum geschäftstüchtigen Mann
Guck dir mal jetzt unser fettes Grinsen an
Und schieb Hass oder Neid oder was auch immer
Fakt ist, dass du uns bewunderst seit dei'm ersten Klassenzimmer

B-Tight,"Ich sehe wie ein Rapper, rede wie ein Rapper
Ich stehe und ich gehe und ich lebe und ich lebe

Wie ein Oldschooler, graue Haare, Falten im Gesicht
Ich bin aus einer anderen Zeit, Rapper galten nicht als hipp
Eher lächerlich, solange, bis dann einer in die Fresse kriegt
Die meisten dachten, dass meine Freundlichkeit eine Schwäche ist
Doch Zeiten ändern sich, so wie der Slang, den man spricht
Wie die Sachen, die man trägt, so wie die Fans, die man trifft
Und die meisten Rapper kommen nicht mal raus aus ihren Käffern
Aber denken, sie wären Stars, weil ein paar Leute sie entdeckt haben
Jeder kann nach oben steigen, aber oben bleiben
Ist 'ne Kunst ohnegleichen in dem Sumpf voller Leichen
Schick die Egos mal beiseite, gebt der Sicht 'n bisschen Weite
Keiner schafft es ganz alleine, denn die Last bricht dir die Beine
Viele dachten, HipHop wäre nur eine Modeerscheinung
Aber für die Musikszene eher 'ne große Befreiung
Und wir machen's klar (Ha!)
Ihr seid geschockt wie nach 'nem Attentat
Man zieht an einem Strang, wenn man das Mikrofon als Waffe hat

Alte Schule (Hey!), Neue Schule (Ho!)
Wir spucken Wörter als wären es Feuerkugeln (Ha!)
Keine Feindschaft, eine Gemeinschaft
Alles brennt lichterloh, weil keiner so geile Lines hat

Die Szene war noch echt und es gab auch viel freshere Flows
Es gab Baggypants und du warst nicht cool, wenn du 'nen Heavy kennst
Lächeln war so lächerlich, als wenn du mit 'nem Teddy pennst
Verschränkte Arme, Mütze im Gesicht
Im CLub wurd' nicht getanzt, nein, im Club wurd' nur genickt
Klos volltaggen, alle Besitzer ärgern sich
So viel kiffen, bis das Paradies auf Erden ist
Sonnenbrille, Silberketten, irgendetwas wildes rappen
Keine Angst zeigen und ans Mikro wie ein Killer steppen
Damals stand alles im Zeichen des Beef
Auf alles scheißen wie Krieg, zu viel Leichen im Kiez
Ich sehe gern zurück, aber ich bin nicht hängen geblieben
Die Szene ändert sich, doch ich bin Rap-Fan geblieben
Zwischen der ganzen Scheiße findet man auch Goldklumpen

Denn die Straße brennt, guckt mal, wie sie aus dem Haus geiern
Alle kommen sie raus, alle bouncen splitterfasernackt

Aber mache gute Laune wie Sonne bei 30 Grad.
Nenn mich Bobby Sommer
Denn sie strahlen wenn ich n Song mach,
Aber geh mir bitte nich auf die Nerven, alta, sonst donnerts
Der König tanzt, mach mal Platz, sonst Uppercut,
Ich mach mich nackt und Bräute brauchen wieder mal ein Sabberlatz,
Ich lach mich schlapp
Ja,es geht immer nur ums Eine,
Viele bunte Scheine und dafür machen Viele, dumme Scheiße
Ich bin Denker und Dichter,Richter und Henker 
Und vieles mehr,doch sicher kein(Gangster)

Ich bin kein Aussenseiter mehr,
Jetz hab ich tausend Neider mehr.
Ihr wollt Aufmerksamkeit, dis is' mir keiner von euch wert
Ein König geht auf Rosenblättern,
Aber ich auf toten Rappern, 
Welche ihre Ziele offensichtlich viel zu hoch gesteckt haben
Meine Texte bohren sich in dein Kopf,
Wie Black&Decker, Bobby Dick, der Inbegriff von fetter Rapper
Zehntausende kommen als Traube zum King hingelaufen,
Ich hänge ab und rauche mein Ding
Egal wie faul ich noch bin,
Ich mach der Frau noch n Kind,
Denn ich denke an mein Königreich,
Ich brauch noch 'n Prinz
Wie der Vater so der Sohn,der Pate auf'n Thron,
Blaues Blut in den Adern, flowe (hart am Mikrofon)",König der Rapper

Krasse Männer packen Tenner in den Joint und paffen länger
Cabrio im Winter fahren, denn Männern ist immer warm
Mit dem Auto dann direkt ins Wohnzimmer fahren
Und dann parken vor der Flimmerkiste, lächerlich wie Killerwitze
Doch so cool, als wär' man bei zwanzig Topmodels in der Mitte
Beef innerlich, tief einatmen
Und dann aus, Ellenbogen raus, breit machen
Frauen sprühen Parfum, Männer vor Testosteron

Halten Opfer auf Distanz mit einer Eisenstange
Und helfen deiner kleinen Schlampe bei 'ner Reifenpanne
Mit dem Schwanz als Wagenheber, ja, wir tanken abends Jäger
Bitch, beleidige uns jetzt und hol dir'n Krankenwagen später
Wir legen los, erledigen den Drecksjob
Wir schreiben Ehre groß und das nicht nur mit Capslock
Wir spucken Kautabak, wir lassen Hinterwäldler filmen
Sieh, wie wir im Sommer ganze Rinderhälften grillen
Haben Kraft, um jeden, der uns für ein' Spinner hält, zu killen
Machen Babies, investieren dann das Kindergeld in Villen
Jäger und Sammler, Emanzen schau'n verdutzt

Sieh mal her, jeder weiß, keiner fickt mit dem Berliner Bär
Du passt dich an wie ein Opfer, ich stelle mich lieber quer
Wer von euch hat die Eier mit Zweieinhalb-Salto von sieben Metern zu springen?
Und wer von euch Rappern findet vor vier Millionen Leuten den Weg in den Ring
Pussys, fast keiner von euch, dein Image hat 'n Stock im Arsch
Ich hab Untergrundlegendenstatus und ich rock es hard

Ich hatte 'ne kurze Pause und auf einmal sind alle King of Rap
(Ha!) dann bin ich ein Gott, ich fick dein' Kopf, das ist mein Job
Du kriegst ein' Schock, dein Herz springt raus und da wo es war, ist ein Loch
Alte Gewohnheiten kommen an den Tag, Nase Koks ich [?] hart
Alles was du sagst, hab ich schon über zehn Jahre vor dir getan
Der mann aus'm Viertel zeigt wieder mal seine Dreckslache

Ich seh' da Weiber, die sich nebenbei 'ne Spur legen
Wenn ihre Muschi juckt regeln wir das
Steck' ich das Pfund in ihren Mund, gibt es kein' Redebedarf
Viele halten nicht die Backen und Philosophien
Gehen sie mir auf'n Sack betäub' ich sie wie Chlorophyll
Hab' ich die Schnauze voll, geh' ich in's Wohnmobil
Und dann knusper ich den Joint, dass ich mich wohler fühl'
Und so geht es jeden Tag ab, gleiches Schema
Du willst Wettsaufen, hack's ab Eisenleber
Sind die Chaoten unterwegs, dann ist Abriss
Fakt ist, alles wird zerschmettert bis es Matsch ist

Aus Langeweile hab' ich angefangen zu kiffen auf der Tour
Party, Hip-Hop, Jägermeister pur
Die Bühne ist bereit und wir ha'm richtig geilen Merch
Kein' Bock den Scheiß zu schleppen also kauf mal noch 'n Shirt
Kurbel kurz die Scheibe runter, Bullen machen Stress
Ich piss' in den Becher, Dicka, negativer Test
Eine Frage hat er noch „Was macht ihr für Musik?“
Doch anstatt 'ner Antwort, hat er Fickfinger gekriegt
Geiles Gefühl, wenn mich das Publikum erkennt

Alle gehen ab, das geht runter wie Öl
Jägerrunden, Jägershots
Ja darauf hat jeder Bock
Vielleicht geht ja heute auch die Leber hops, scheißegal
Nach der Show, frischmachen
Eddings auf den Tisch packen
Bisschen mit den Fans chillen und mit ihren Kids lachen
Autogrammstunde lachend in den Blitz starren
Manche Ladys wollen, dass ich sie heute zu 'ner Bitch mache

?, ich mache den Abpfiff klar
Baue am Tag gefühlte achzig mal
Brauchst du etwa Ott
Heck geht klar
Rufst du durch, Nachbar kommt, Heckticker
Versteck' dein Gras, ich frag „Wie, Zoll?“
Und vor zehn Jahren, fand jeder unsere Beats toll

Während der Beat rollt
Schiff' ich in den Becher hinter'm DJ Pult
Das Bier ist schuld
Seit zwanzig Jahren Mucke machen
Anderen in die Suppe kacken
Hier und da mal gold'ne Platten
Platin haben wir auch ihr Affen

Er war krumm, er brannte schief
Aber immerhin meine Mischung passte
Habs noch ein paar mal versucht
Aber da war nix zu machen
Ich besorgte ne Bong
Ist zwar bequemer aber Unterwegs
Stellte sie dann immer ein Problem dar
Rauchen auf mein' Nacken ist OK
Aber sauber machen - Nö!
Hab ich gar kein Bock, ab in Müll damit (ey)
Siggi, bring mal Blättchen und paar Filter mit

Bunte Bilder kriegt

Natürlich übt man weiter
Über nacht den Bübel paffen, Flügel wachsen - 1A (hey)
Dann ging alles, vom Sticky bis zum Meterblunt
Alle wollten bauen wie Bob
Doch das kann nicht Jedermann
Gäb es eine Meisterschaft, hätt ich wahrscheinlich schon Gold
Ich kann die Zukunft sehen, es wird heiter und wolkig
Schneller als man denkt, ist der komplette Joint ausgeraucht
Bauen wie am Fließband, aber ist OK

Um einmal rumzupissen! Alle haben uns verglichen
Und geäußert das du bitest! Wenn Irie high ist
Und rappen dabei so trip bist du zwar noch im Cockpit
Doch auf dem Weg nach unten! Ich könnte Stunden rappen
Auch im Schlaf wenn ich im Bett bin! Yo! Yo! Was wäre wenn

Ich war direkt verrückt, bin nicht auf deinen Geruch klar gekommen
Ich wusste noch nicht wie du aussiehst
Doch ich war verknallt, ich war mir sicher, dass du mich irgendwann auch liebst
Auf der Straße machte mich dein Duft oft nervös
Ich hab gesucht, doch du hast dich in Luft aufgelöst
Zeit ist relativ, lass' sie gemeinsam verschwenden
Bestimmt bist du chillig, wir haben keine Differenzen
Du und ich auf der Couch, ich mal' es mir schon aus
PS4, Knabberzeug, alles was man so braucht
Das erste mal sind wir uns an einem Ort begegnet, der fremd für mich war
Du hast kein Wort geredet
Ich habe dich berührt, du warst ziemlich klebrig
Du hast mich verzaubert, ich war wie benebelt
Der erste Kuss wie ein Schuss ins Gehirn
Seit dem bist du drin und ich muss auf dich hören

Man sieht sich immer zweimal im Leben ich find dich immer noch scheiße
Ich brauch was reines dagegen, ich ignoriere deine Reize
Doch je mehr ich mich entferne desto mehr ziehst du mich an
Auch wenn deine Küsse Gift für mein Herz sind, ich liebe dich ein Leben lang

Auf einam war alles nicht mehr so traumhaft
Aufgewacht und wie weggewischt war der Zauber (Shit)
Die Realität war ernüchternd, erdrückend, sie hat mich eingeschüchtert
Du hast gesagt alle hätten mich im Auge
Versuchen mir zu schaden
Soll den Hexen nicht mehr glauben
Jeder, der mich nicht vergöttert ist gleich ein Hater
Höhenflug und ich verliere dabei meine Feder
Ich hab immer deine Stimme im Ohr
Horrortrip und immer kommen die Kinder drin vor
Ich bin zerissen, ich will nichts mit dir zu tun haben
Aber hab dich viel zu gern in meiner Blutbahn
Du hast viel zu oft mein Leben bestimmt
Doch dich los zu werden ist wie Pissen gegen den Wind
Du bist ein Dolch in meinem Herzen

Ist nur einer von hunderten Dealer
Jeder will seinen Schnapp abhaben
Paar Pappnasen in den Parka blasen
Auf der Suche nach dem Bunker und wenn sie ihn gefunden haben, das Geld dann knallhart verbraten
Andere versuchen den veganen Weg, aber werden vom Staat brutal zerlegt
Zu wenig um zu leben, zu viel um zu sterben
Langsam aber sicher wird die Lage schräg
Alle träumen vom großen Glück, aber denken es kommt in den Schoß gehüpft
Die Trägheit macht dich krank als wenn du die falsche Möse fickst

Wenn man so was sieht wünscht man sich sie wären implodiert
Es kommt eine auf mich zu und sagt „Sowas schon probiert?“
Ich bin nicht interessiert, doch die Bitch kapiert's nicht
Sie schwabbelt um mich rum bis sie Schellen einkassiert
Unermüdlich schmeißt sich das Ding an mich ran
Komm um die Ecke

Dumm wie sie ist, wird sie jetzt für immer vermisst

Deine Sonnenmilch macht mir auch Kraft! Klar! Schau! Ich brauch das
Denn dann sieht jeder klar wie Rauchglas wer der King ist am Strand!

Kurz gesagt es ist dope wie Koks ab fünfundzwanzig Grad Celsius!
Bei wolkenlosem Himmel trag ich Socken, Schuhe und Shorts!
Proportional zu Sonnenstrahlen fallen Hüllen im wahrsten Sinne des Worts!
Jungs werden forsch und auch die Bräute werden rallig!
Nackte Haut, Muskeln, Titten, Ärsche! Im Sommer sieht man alles!
Weil ich mich an frischer Luft von der Sonne gern braten lasse
Ist es klar das ich meinen Arsch zur Poolparty im Garten schaffe!
Ich hasse es wenn sich im Sommer Gemüter erhitzen!

Ich brauch keine Starallüren
Die hatte ich schon, voll abgehoben
Stripperin mit krassen Kurven, die mir das Geld aus der Tasche zogen
Ein riesen Batzen Drogen, führten oft zu Katastrophen
Arrogant hielt ich Silberschmuck und die Waffe oben
Deine Freundin hatet, ey was fällt ihr denn ein
Immerhin gehörte doch die ganze Welt mir allein
Ich sollte meine Zunge zügeln
Doch hat nen Laberflash auf Grund der Haze gepumpten Lungenflügel
Viele ham sich schon gebückt
Für den Traum vom großen Glück
Am Ende stehn sie da mit nichts
Merken dann wie tot es ist
Duckmäuse Schluckspechte Hauptsache nen Majordeal
Hunderttausend Follower mit neunzigtausend Fakeprofilen
Ich bin ein Sturkopf, versinke im Purloch
Wieder zu Hause gibt es ein Feierabend Purkopf
Du kannst von mir halten was du willst, am liebsten meinen Schwanz
Saug mal dran so schmeckt die Arroganz

Von morgens bis abends, vierundzwanzig-sieben
Denke ich immer an Musik, weil ich sie liebe
Leute fragen mich wann ich es endlich aufgebe
An dem Tag an dem ich draufgehe

Ich bin ein ganz normaler Typ so wie du
Mit viel Liebe zur Musik so wie du
Zünd die Lunte an und flieg so wie du
So wie du, so wie du, so wie du

Auch wenn ihr sagt es schadet mir
Ab und zu brauch ich Starallüren
Ich versuche mein Leben normal zu führen
Doch viele kenn die Grenzen nicht
Dann wird es ungemütlich
Ich bin von Grund auf friedlich
Lächeln ist keine Schwäche
Aber die meisten kennen den Unterschied nicht
Wenn man ein Kumpeltyp ist führt es oft zu Missverständniss
Ich bleibe ruhig doch meistens endet's in
„Verpiss dich endlich“
Ich brauch keinen Benz, keine Ketten, keine Uhren mehr
Rapper tun auf Pimp, aber leben als wenn sie Huren wären
Mir reicht ein voller Magen
Dach überm Kopf
Mein Familienglück
Doch will nie wieder Hass in nem Block
Ich spiele meine Rolle ohne sie zu übertreiben
Aggroberlin war geil
Doch ich würde nie wieder unterschreiben
Fremde werden Freunde, Freunde werden Feinde
Doch die besten Freunde einer Plattenfirma bleiben Scheine
Ich bleib geerdet, realistisch wie möglich
Und ganz ehrlich
Dieses Business ist tödlich

B. Reith,"I'm back by popular demand
Well not really, but my optimism's grand
A little success has got me in a jam
I never thought I'd say I got too many fans
You can thank my face for that, I mean wait
Myspace, Facebook, lets face the facts
I'm at the bottom of the charts, but we aiming high
Kinda hard when they still can't say your name right
Took some time away from the game
Came back same thing though times have changed
I'm no longer that dude from that 70's show
Now I'm the guy who's video is in American Eagle
I stay fly like seagulls got hair like the Beatles
Spit truth for the people just call this a sequel

We get knocked down but we get right back up
Keep on comin back we k-k-keep on comin' back for more
There is a fire burns deep inside us
We're the comeback kids kids we're the comeback kids

Round 2, they're askin' what's new
How you gonna comeback B what you gonna do?
Took a couple shots to the face from some critics
Can't imagine what they gonna say when they hear this
I'm done tryin' to fit in, thought about quittin'
Can't stop now we can't afford to give in
Learned my lesson through facin' opposition
If life doesn't hurt then we're not really livin'
So we take punch after punch like
Cassius Clay or Sugar Ray you see
This hard knock life might make my heart break
But you ain't gonna make no quitter out of me
Keep fightin' til' the war is won

We're the comeback kids kids we're the comeback kids

I'm back, I gotta manager now
He's 6'4 black and his name is Cal
If you got a problem yo he'll solve it
I got a style they still don't know what to call it
I've been on the grind since L.J. was a Hornet
Way before the days of Chris Paul in New Orleans
Back in the days of M. Jackson and Jordan
I was on that 8-track reel to reel recordin'
And I still gotta pay to get on
Paid my dues yet I still can't pay my loans
Couldn't find a hot beat so I made my own
Couldn't find a hot street so we paved a road
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin my song
While you're at it could you please stop sayin' my name wrong
Keep fightin' to the break-break of dawn

Won't you please come rescue me as quickly as you can

It's crazy how far we go
Just to put a little gas in our ego
That's what happens when your self esteem is low
We'll do anything to get people to notice us I know
It's tough but hey, imagine us throwin' our lives away
Because we're listenin' to the voice inside that chants
Says we'll never be significant if we can't
Fit in so we get into all kinds of trouble tryin' to be somebody we're not
Since in the beginning we've been givin' into the lie that says that we got
To keep up with the Jones's or get left behind
So we end up in debt tryin' to catch up it's messed up
'Cause ten years from now we can't press rewind

I keep on tryin to write but songs ain't comin out
Plus now I'm getting older and time is runnin out I know,
Growth's a process but I can't see my progress
And I'm startin' to feel that my labor's in vain
So I hold on to the promise instead of my problems
Otherwise this stress is gonna drive me insane
Yes there's more to life than workin' 9 to 5
Buyin' things that make you feel fuzzy inside
I tried it and it worked at first for five minutes
But left me in the cold to hang like icicles oh!
Now I'm froze like a popsicle
Feel's like my mission's impossible
I'm stuck up in a maze full of obstacles
Keep on ending where I'm not supposed to go

Won't you please come rescue me as quickly as you can

I just want to be okay with who I am, not have to run away
I'm so tired of trends I can't keep pretending
Playing these foolish games

Tell them they can stuff it, I'm not about to rough it

Talk like a vicar when they get a little tickle
And they get a little sick when they get a little flop.

We stay and praise Malvolio

Original general, quite like a girdle
Representin Jesus the eternal life colonel
I'm over like a hurdle, harder than the turdle
Lyrics healthier than herbal
B.B. Jays sturdy, never profane
Never x-rated or dirty, never ashamed
(Holy hustler) Practice sold faithful
I'm on some holy holy, emcees be grateful

Hook: [B.B. Jay]

I hate to say I told you so, but didn't I?
Tell you I was gonna blow-up and be the bomb
Everybody had mad jokes when I was strugglin
Now I'm fat like that, what, word to God
I hate to say I told you so, but didn't I?
Tell you I was gonna blow-up and be the bomb
Everybody had mad jokes when I was strugglin
Now I'm fat like that, what, word to God

[B.B. Jay]
Check it
It all started way back when I was a chap in grade school
Used to write songs an' poems in the day room
Every music award show, yo I stayed tuned
Word to God, as true as I grew, kids made room
No doubt, rejection was a sho' thing
Never get love until you doing yo' thang
You know how it is, around ghetto kids
Hype, do you sign ???
Made a lot of rap fears when I drops mines
Lotta cats did all they could to stop mines
Recognize yo, you can't stop the shine
Or the glow, ice on ice, I make livin look pro
Show ya right, the son of abraham I am
Born American, culture African
A lotta of imposters I peeped your chief-tan
I'm a holy hustler, backwards buster

Hook

[B.B. Jay]
I used to rock a lot, back in the day, back of the class
In back of the school, battlin for cash in back of tha cab
I used jack up a lotta (Rap dummies)
I used to stak up a lotta (Lunch money)
Dough fo' sho' my flow was a number one
Yo, I told you cats since day number one
B.B. Jay ain't nothin but a plan and a man
But little did you know I had the power of I Am
All day from the getty up
Even back when I was leaving cats belly up
With they skull cracked, uh huh
I ain't always where I be at
Used to get buzzed with cous' like ""where the tree at?""
Life of sin, had to flee that, palm was icy
On my way to hell, believe that, on some shiesty
Now I see clearly, holy life the nicest
Fat pastor, loungin with the righteous

Last night I felt lucky but my luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces and the police broke down the door

Seems like all the bad breaks come to you

Got home this morning, she was looking kind-a funny
She said, ""Don't come in here daddy, unless you got some money""
I said, ""Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?""
It's tough when you can't make no money,

I asked my woman for some dinner, she looked at me like a fool
She said, ""I'm playing checkers, daddy, and I think it's your time to move""

B.B. King,"The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?

And throw him in the jail for a crime
I got the blues
Mm, I'm singing my blues
I've been around a long time
Mm, I've really paid some dues

Can we do just one more?

Oh I thought I'd go down to the welfare
To get myself some grits and stuff
But a lady stand up and she said
""You haven't been around long enough""
That's why I got the blues
Mm, the blues
I say, I've been around a long time
I've really, really paid my dues

Fellows, tell them one more time.

Ha, ha, ha. That's all right, fellows.
Yeah!",Why I Sing the Blues
B.B. King,"The sound that you're listening to 
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille, Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say, brought me fame
I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille
Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help me call my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this 
Was the thing that I wanted to do 
But somehow or other When I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and started the singing blues

Well, now when I'm paying my dues, 
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always, you know like, depend on Lucille

Sort of hard to talk to you myself
I guess I'll let Lucille say a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through,
Like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she misuses me,
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely 
Well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille
And it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to me, you know?
Sometime I get to the place where I can't even say nothing
Look out

Sometime I think it's crying

You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra or, 
Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do it, 
'Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
'Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille
Sing, Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings, 
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, 
A little Ray Charles, in fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there

One more, Lucille!

Take it easy now, ah!

You know, I imagine a lot of you wanna know, 
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille 
Lucille has practically saved my life two or three times 
No kidding, it really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and
When the car stopped turning over, it fell over on Lucille, 
And it held it up off me, really, it held it up off me 
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, 
I was Over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of that one, have you? 
And one night the guys started a ball over there, you know, started brawling, you know what I mean
And the guy that was mad with his old lady, 
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burning for heat, 
The gas ran all over the floor

And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building
Caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save Lucille
Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started that brawl that night was named Lucille

And that's been Lucille ever since to me
One more now, Lucille

Sounds pretty good to me. Can I do one more?

Look out, Lucille

Sounds pretty good. I think I'll try one more 
All right",Lucille

To know when I've finally have won
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

Well, I've cried enough tears
To recognize this feeling called a smile
I've been bottom rung long enough
To know when I'm doin' it in style

I've been runnin' so long enough
To know when there's no more need to run

And I'm sailin' on a ship that's overdue

B.B. King,"The sound that you're listening to is from my guitar
That's named Lucille. I'm very crazy about Lucille.
Lucille took me from the plantation. Oh you might say,
Brought me fame.
I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille.
Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help
Me call my name.

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this was
The thing that I wanted to do. But somehow or other
When I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and
Started singing blues.

Well, now when I'm paying my dues, maybe you don't
Know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when
Things are bad with me. I can always, I can always,
You know like, depend on Lucille.

Sort of hard to talk to you myself. I guess I'll let
Lucille say a few words and then.

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do. But
When I think about the things that I've gone through,
Like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and
She misuses me, and I go home at night, maybe I'm
Lonely, well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille
And it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to
Me, you know. Sometime I get to the place where I
Can't even say nothing.

Look out.

Sometime I think it's crying.

You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra
Or Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do
It, 'cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the
Blues. I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about
That. Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille.
Sing, Lucille.

Well, I'll put it like this. Take it easy, Lucille. I
Like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank
Sings, but I can get a little Frank, Sammy, a little
Ray Charles, in fact all the people with soul in
This.

A little Mahalia Jackson in there.

One more, Lucille!

Take it easy now.

You know, I imagine a lot of you wanna know, a lot of
You wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille. Lucille
Has practically saved my life two or three times. No
Kidding, it really has.

I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and
When the car stopped turning over, it fell over on
Lucille, and it held it up off me, really, it held it
Up off me. So that's one time it saved my life.

The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, I was
Over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of
That one, have you? And one night the guys started a
Ball over there, you know, they started brawling, you
Know what I mean. And the guy that was mad with his
Old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was
Burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor.

And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building
Caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save
Lucille. Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I
Call it Lucille, the lady that started that brawl that
Night was named Lucille.

And that's been Lucille ever since to me. One more
Now, Lucille.

Sounds pretty good to me. Can I do one more?

Look out, Lucille.

Sounds pretty good. I think I'll try one more. All

B.B. King,"If your whole life somehow
Wasn't much 'til now
And you've almost lost
Your will to live
No matter what you've been through
Long as there's breath in you
There is always one more time

And if your dreams go bad
Every one that you've had
That don't mean that some dreams
Can't come true
'Cause it's funny about dreams
As strange as it seems
There is always one more time

Oh turnin' corners
Is only a state of mind
Keeping your eyes closed
Is worse than being blind

If there's a heart out there
Looking for someone to share
I don't care if it's been
Turned down time and time again
And if we meet one day
Please don't walk away
'Cause there is always one more time
There is always one more time",There Is Always One More Time

They brought me over on a ship
Men were standing over me
And a lot more with a whip
And everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues
Well, I've been around a long time

And every people, all the people
Got the same trouble as mine
I got the blues, huh huh
I say I've been around a long time
I've really paid some dues

I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.

B.E.F.,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night

You can't survive in this game 'cause you niggas lame
I'm ready to take it to some ""G"" shit, street shit
Where caps get peeled, and wigs bound to get split
I'm off Valence, ain't no doubt this B.G. ain't real
I'm bout to *hic* hiccup some bullets out my fuckin' steel
Peel, make niggas kneel, bow down
From this clown that's gonna put you six in the ground.
It's time a nigga put Big Boy where the fuck they belong
Rollin' wit Tec-9 best believe it's on
Raise up, raise up, raise up, raise up, raise up

",Down for My Stacks
B.G.,"Verse 1: (B.G.)
Money makin' is my thing
A mill is what I'm tryin' to reach
Good shit to my peeps is what the fuck I preach
Baby Gangsta is my title
Al Kapone is my idile
To protect and serve 
I roll with my assault rifle
Jack niggaz for nothin' less than a quarter key 
Take hits on buster niggas..... startin' at five G's
Oh, I'm the young nigga dressed in black on black
With glocks to mack in the hoop in 'dis black on black
Spillin' brains ain't nothin but a thang to me
Sellin cane and fame ain't nothin but a thang to me
When you see the B.G. 
I run wit' all real niggas
Valence and Magnolias
It list nothing but trill niggas
And we get ill, tryin' pay the bills, nigga
Use the skills to hustlin to make a mill nigga
For information w'ere beachin' to make you squeel nigga
Don't spill, we use the index finger to kill nigga
How you feel gettin caught up in my paper chase 
Ya' feel the deal gettin caught up in my paper chase 
Go out the way 'for my pockets to be nice and fat
I tote that K 'for my pockets to be nice and fat 
Picture a nigga from uptown wit' a million
Actin' bad, buyin' motherfuckin' buildins
Get out the way or give your cash to me
You see, I bring heat backed up by B.G.
Young niggas gettin busy
Totin' K's like it ain't nothin' 
Uptown niggas buckin' like it ain't nothin'
Baby given coke to the young soldiers 
I told ya we takin' over
Knockin' heads off shoulders
Think you boulder 'cause you older, but I'm colder
With the trigger I'll run all over ya'
Niggas talkin' yat and stuff
Wan' be rough, but I'ma see if you can back it up
Wan' be tough 
Let's take to a triller level
Let's get iller like a guerilla 
On the killer level
Just fuck wit' me that's all I'm wishin'
I'ma dust ya' 
Because I know you're softer than whoopie cushion
I be dishin' clips in and out like a ??? cat 
Come from the back in black 
Ready t-t-to attack-tack 
I'll leave 'ya flat, nigga

(Chorus)
1,2,3

You best rush home
'For you get bust on....skip

Verse 2: (Turk)
I'm tryin' to be cool in this game
This shits nothin' nice 
Play wit' niggas 'dese days
They'll leave yo' body cold as ice
But I say fuck 'em all
My ball never fall
Five feet eight inches tall
My back against the wall
All I do is fuck hoes 
I got dreams to make a mill
Like them niggas in the nolia
The hustlin' skills pays my bills 
But still keep my hand on my glock just in case
Niggas try'na plot seventeen shots gonna stop 
The many tracks and that's a fact
Leavin' niggas on they back 
Bitches play goin' get smacked
Espicially if I don't disrespect you
And you disrespect me
I'ma have to show 'ya 
That I'm out that fuckin' M-a-g(Magnolia)
I'm keepin' it real wit' my click, 226
Smoke weed, hit P, get a lil' dizzy

Ridin' five-hundreds Benz across town

Actin' wild, three young niggas
Don't mind pullin' the fuckin trigger

Baby:That's the return of the trill ass niggas

It's time to graduate, bags ain't doin the job no mo'
Now a needle and some dope, tap dat green vein
Smoke blunts sometime, it's all about that bank
My heart don't pump lemonade, it pump battery juice
Make me pump the trigga finga up when I'm after you

Pop the cop or go down, cause we ain't down with that crew
Get caught up in the crossfire, best believe It's All On you
+Ohh, it ain't my fault+, I done what I had to do
Give a fuck about no nigga, that nigga don't give a fuck about me
Any chance he get he gon' take it, try to sweep me off my feet
That's why I keep my eyes wide, nigga cross that line they gon' die

I'ma top knot shot caller, from the clique CMB Ballers
Fuckin' niggaz daughters, got my shit sittin' on Brawlers
I'm mad boy, with this clique I'ma act a ass boy
It's cash boy, I don't think you could last boy
I'm bout to pull some out the hall type shit
Some Steven Seagal type shit
Some *cgghh* knife shit
Don't think you niggaz feelin' that 226
Behind me the crucifix, chop or get chopped, split or get split
Doogie, Lil Wayne, Lil Turk, Lil Terius, better tell 'em
These niggaz are felons, ""HOT BOY"" be which we yellin'
Right know you close to the devil, and your lip gon' get you hurt
Picture this, three ways gon' tear up your turf

B.G.,"Aw.....I'm comin' through the fog,
Dressed in black
Knock Yo muthafuckin' head off
Bitch nigga stop playin' wit me

First Verse:

Spark it up make it happen, grab your piece
You deceased, fuckin' with me, oh it's pure beef
Tragedy, homicide, battle me out there,
Nothin' in between but air, bitch I don't play fair
I come through like an Amtrak, what'cha gone do?
Got a strap but it's on safety, mine ready to let loose,
I hit'cha spot, niggas scatter,
I ratta-tatta, whatever it don't matter,
Hollows come out like blat-blatta
I gotta shop across town, applied it so they doomed,
Soon as it hit Noon I'm blastin' off in the room,
First thing flinch I go boom,
With the sweeper I sweep like a broom,
Creep like the Grim Reaper leavin' everything wound
When the Moon come out, that's when the snakes come out,
The fakes go in, you got it, hide out in the drought,
You leave a gat open I'm squeezin' it 'cause I'm scopin', hopin'
I can catch a nigga with some birds just locin',
So I can uh-abuse the bitch,
Misuse the bitch, refuse me then his family gone lose the bitch
I'm colder than ice, I'm smoother than sand,
Baby Gangsta headbusta just a clean up man

Chorus:

On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand,
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man,
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand,
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man,
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand,
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man

Second Verse:

B.G., Hot Boy, leave ya dick in the dirt,
Ride with Juvey, Lil' Wayne, and Turk,
Puttin' faces on shirts,
You know tuh-uh-together, we acts a ass,
Fifty shots, out each clip we blast,
Full of that trash, out the St. T,
We mash on the gas,
Hangin' out the window, hit the heat
Apply pressure to yo head nigga,
And little bullets take red from yo head nigga,
Should have watched your mouth and not said what you said nigga,
But uhn-uhn-uhn, now that nigga's dead, nigga
It's All On you,
If you got beef, would you freeze, ha nigga?
Grab the ass kicker and hit the enemy block nigga?
If you got beef would you squash it and eat it?
Make a nigga bleed, or think it's cool and now you eatin' it?
If you got beef would you try to sleep on it?
If it's with me you ain't thinkin' 'cause I'll creep homie,
If you got beef  better squeeze trigga nigga,
Kill it no matter what even if it takes four beats nigga

Chorus

Third Verse:

I come hard enough, ya feelin' me?
Fa shiggedy,
Bitch niggas gone get they wiggadys splitti, splitti
You done pissed these niggas off from Chopper City,
In each and every K we tote, they got fifty,
So bring it on however you want to bring it on,
Yo block explode like a bomb,
I'm dangerous and armed,
The B.G. did it, I live til' I'm gone,
I'ma H.B., and gotta get my shine on,
So when the gangsta situation's starin' at you,
Nigga look the other way or do what'cha gotta do,
I'm quick to leave all the choices on you,
Gotta trigga happy clique ask questions after they shoot,
The people in blue can't even take the scene I leave,
If ten niggas on the block, then ten niggas I leave,
Now Frank Mignon got work for three weeks,
That's how the U.P.T. play it if we got beef,
I'm stompin' on dangerous grounds, K in my hand,
I ain't bout playin', call me the clean up man,
Call me the clean up man, on dangerous grounds with the K off in my hand.",Clean Up Man
B.G.,"Yeah, we gon' go old school, ya know what I'm sayin'
If you from where I'm from, ya know what I'm talkin' 'bout

And every time that I slide, you know I'm platinum plus
Make the hood understand that we trying to come up

Tell Lil' One be cool, everybody coming up
'Cause everybody wanna ride, everybody wanna shine
So how ya love that people? Everybody on the grind

And these projects cuts ya, ya hood rich livin' lavish
Those 14s, you know we had to have it
Once upon a time it was nothing but magic
Hustling right in front of my mama, Ms. Gladys

I'm from the south streets of beast like Lil' Weez
E, F baby for the team I rep daily
I come to the defense like Jeff Bailey, I'm gone wit it

A chrome kitted, a foam pit in the back of it
Phony *** *** come home with me, get the business
I made bling bling, I'm like a lighthouse
So shut that ice in 'cause he ain't iced out

Pay attention closely, you *** can never roast me

Come through the neighborhood with my homeboy price
Lets get it understood, pimpin' that's my price
Come through the neck of the woods, you be alright

And they spinnin', they spinnin', spinnin', them sprewells pimpin'

B.G.,"I ain't nothin,' but seventeen years old 
Want to fulfill my dream have a million records sold 
But niggas hatin on me everyday and that's cold 
I keep my four-four and I ain't gon' let it go 
My money can't fold no more it's in stacks 
My nose is close now I see that ain't where it's at 
My hoes done elevated I'm on another level 
My wrist done elevated to rolex with the bezel 
I'm young but bout nice things off top 
Don't fuck wit' what I worked hard for cause I'll hit yo' block 
I ride in big bodies 
I sleep in big beds 
Always wear boks (reeboks) and bauds always gon' bust a head 
I'm a well-known lil' nigga 
On my cell phone talkin' bout six figures 
You get yo' dome bust on in a split second 
'Cause I'm gonna keep my rep as a livin' legend, a livin legend 

[Chorus] 

What make niggas think they fuck wit raps I spit 
What make 'em think they can touch beats from Fresh I get 
What make 'em think they can compete with this hot boy clique 
This haterism goin on and the world makin' me sick 
I'ma top notch baller all bout' my cheese 
I'm the one got yo' bitch and her girls talkin' bout me 
B.G. name rating like a Thompson fall 
Cruisin' in my truck on the lake bazookas crumpin', dog 
Fresh behind me in the burb twenties blind y'all 
Niggas that broke lookin for hustle so they ridin fall 
But I got my pistol for the busters got they eye on my gucci 
Man I refuse to let these jackers gain a stripe off lil' duga 
Since twelve I been thuggin keep a frog in my mouth 
I had a dream off top but this rap game no doubt 
Don't get mad you ask yo' boo who the man and she confesson 
'Dat 'Dat lil' nigga off VL is a living legend 

[Chorus]

I know with my skills I'll rule the south 
Out bitch niggas mouth I'm sh-shoot about 
Niggas don't even know me want to leave BGeezy smellin' 
It ain't my fault my tape stopped yo' shit from selling 
I'm tellin' you fuck wit' me you'll learn yo' lesson 
I'm tellin' you I'm all about dome checking 
I'm like the eclipse close yo' eye's I'll blind ya 
Quick to out shine ya

B.G.,"[Talking]
Picture, I'm always plannin kaperz tryin to come up on cheese
But my kaperz goin sour for the Lil' B.G., peep me

[Verse One]
I was born a loser, a stank pussy abuser
Murders I'm accused 'cause I'm a AK user
Struggle for my stat to be phattest on knots
Pack Glocks wit 17, keep a nigga off my block, it's hot
'Cause it's bumpin, got nothin but dope traffic
Six figgas what I'm after, can't be play'n and laugh'n
Young wit good sense, bent behind the tents
In front of this baller house that I'm 'bout to go in
I got it mapped up, it's planned all out
I demand you denied, them lights goin all out
I done scoped for 3 weeks, been broke for 3 weeks
Hope inside they got a bird of coke and 10 G
The niggas in the project come in black like always
Invisible wit the mack, it's dark in the hallways
Creepin so slow, 'cause it's on the second flo'
I gets up there, they got a crack in the front do'
I push it wit ease
Nigga freeze
Get on yo knees
No keys, no G's
I find dead bodies
Two wit head shots, one nigga still breathin, he bleedin heavily
I'm leavin a made G
Get back to the car, tryin to get far as I can
Nigga planned what I planned, my gun shakin in my hand
It's one way goin gettin money and the power
Gotta think again 'cause my plan went sour

[Chorus]2x
That's cold, I'm tryin to hold money and the power
Everything I do goes sour, hour after hour
I don't want to sale flour, I want a office in a tower
Sittin on G's wit 30 keys of powder

[Verse Two]
I lay back and think again, tryin to come up on cheese
Do what I gotta do, nigga it's all on me
Just like it's all on you to chose right from wrong
Might be a power move to go in this nigga home
I'ma handle my biz, plan it out and shit
ain't killin no kids, but I'ma split his wig
If I have to spank his bitch, I'ma spank the ho
Get off the motherfuckin flo' and take me to the coke
Now where the stash at, where the cash at, where the grass at
Look at this chopper in my hand, I'ma blast that, pass that
Green shit wit Ben Franklin on it
I'll spill you nigga, ain't no need for thankin on it
I gots to have it, up it busta, real fast
Fo' I get to the point, fuck it buster, and I'll blast
You play with fire get burned, fuck wit B.G. get burnt
I'ma hustla 'til death, be trill to my last brat
I let my nuts hang, I'm bout money and the power
Thinkin again 'cause my plan went sour
That's cold, man that's cold
My plan went sour

[Chorus]2x

[Verse Three]
I planned this and I done planned that
But every time it go sour, I can't stand that
I want money and the power in my hand black
I'ma end up leavin the game, what the fuck is that?
I done kidnapped, I done jacked, I done slung the mack
And everytime the kaper over, I bring nothin back
I have no paper and I'm sober I ain't havin that
Any high-roller got what I want, then I'm grabbin that
All I got is my rap folder tryin to make a mill
But they got niggas even colder tryin to make a mill
I just be real and hope B.G. hit the jack pot
Put on the spot, every tape we drop, hit the store hot
We got a plan and we clique tight on the rise, I come out Juvey ride
Hot Boyz come out, we all ride
I'm 'bout mine and ya know to progress, gotta struggle
Do what I gotta do, gotta rap hustle
Ya playa hate, I pluck ya, fuck ya, hoes jock ya mail
You know I gotta duck, but I'm tryin to bring up tape sales
'Cause I got a plan, I got a plan to go platinum
Holdin my dick, G's and a strap in my hand

[Chorus] 3x

[Talking]
Nigga, respect that
All these niggas puttin on they black mask
Dressin up to get dey cash, ya heard me
Don't go in that kaper if it ain't planned right
'Cause it ain't gon' come out right
You ain't gon' come out wit no mail
Make sure you got it down pat
I done been through it
And I ain't bring nothin back
But I'm bringin this shit to the fuckin distribution people
And they sendin some shit back, ya heard me

Get in my way and your shit get split nigga
Uptown is a cage for monkeys and killers
Got to be realah around all these guerrillas
But it's cool I'm a young thug nigga
Rough like a rug nigga ain't scared to plug nigga
I was turned out at an early age
On V.L. not afraid the rocks and the twelth gauge
Raised like a slave caught up in that thirteenth cage
On that dust ready bust
Plus blunts got a nigga don't give a fuck
I hope you got your vest on
If you don't when the K blast you won't have your chest on
Nigga now you get your rest on
Brains blown gettin' a yellow tape zone

Is the silver packs? Is it the twenty sacks?

Verse 2
All I wanted was to be comfortable with a lot of mil

And I'm risking going to jail and gettin' left stale
I'm gettin' tired of this all day block shit 
Cock glock with this rock after rock shit
Could it be me servin' for twenty, 
2-5, 11-5, or the muthafuckin' even 5
And I'm servin' 4 and a half to 28
And I might front it if you come straight it and not late
Try to play me I'm gonna bust your muthafuckin' grape
I ain't gonna be stingy with the yah because I ain't fake
But now all I got is the nikel piece now
Struggling with it tryin' to get on my feet now
I'm on a hunt for some A-K funk 
Double barrel pump full of that skunk ready to pop the trunk
Over this nigga they got a contract
I gots to have that give me the mad mask in the all black

Verse 3
My pockets empty and I'm loaded that just don't match
Two and two together that's why where the fuck I'm at
On my ass tryin' to make a power move 
Servin niggaz two birds of flour it's sour but it's a come up fool
I'm on that dope it ain't no secret but that shit ain't shive 
How am I stay high stay shive and get mine
I can't do it so I gotta try to kick the habit
Or that million I want I might not never have it
So I got to try to keep my muthafuckin' nose close
Or I'm gonna end up drove with no hoes 
It's all about the fuckin' feddy, the mil
The eight, and the seven grams that sale on the scale
I can not fail to hit the top of the charts
Young with heart I survive off street smarts
Play with me clips slide in the K
Play whit me I'll spin your bin every day
I refuse to lose I paid dues to jump
I'm on a come up I I got the twelth gauge on pump
Busted heads clips thrown my way 
Bustin' heads to let you know I don' t play 
I'm out to have things I spit rhymes to get down
Hands clap when I get down doing bad Uptown

(Chorus)
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the silver packs?

First Verse [Baby]
I need me a lick, to come up on a hundred G's
(How be?)
Movin' these fuckin' kees
(Where be?)
Run em' in that U.P.T.
(And who gone run em?)
Tha brotha and my B.G.

[B.G.]
You gotta beat em
(That nigga is my lady)
Four golds and I'm out there baby

[Baby]
I hit my safe for a hundred and fifty G's
(Why nigga?)
Orderin' for 20 kees
(Street value?)
Two hundred and fifty G's
(And what's yo profit?)
A lick for a hundred G's

[B.G.]
My people, Baby, bout to bring us some heavy Snow white
Mama told me I'ma have to go on that all night flight
Fuck breakin' two hundred I'm breakin' Q.B's
Ziploc'em up and send em to that U.P.T.
Never seen a triple beam and so much yay
On his porch stairs, nothin' but mail
One hundred G's with ease now that's no big drama
I keep packin' shit to keep icin' lil' Mama
Too many kees bringin' rats and gats and cadillacs
But through thick and thin, V.L. got my back

Chorus

Second Verse: [Baby]
Fuckin' break these kees down to quarter kees
Let Vamp run em all in the Third Ward U.P.T.
K.C. drop this load on my B.G.
(Tear da kee)
Bring me back nigga a hundred G's
Nigga get yo shit
(Nigga I got my shit)
Ready to cock yo shit?
(I'm ready to pop my shit)

[B.G.]
I'ma take yo breath, introduce you to death

Tired of flippin' these hustlas, I wanna flip some G's
So what's up wit Baby?
(Graduated from kees)
We gone make this shit happen, we gone flood em out Uptown
And we gone bring and sprinkle a bit downtown
We ride Lexus with interos, MoMos or Cameros
Slim got the coke in a wayside barrel for 22-5
(Got the kees for 11-5)
Come to the B.G. I might do it for a even 5
Nigga I ball and people don't know it, 'cause I don't show it
The only way to find out is if you come and score it
'cause I don't stop with no hoe or no show
I wear my polo, and get a bucket and keep it on the downlow

Chorus

Third Verse [Manny]:
Never out her, money and the powder
Nigga move the shit from Uptown to Crowder
Who got the sprinkle to make yo ass wrinkle?
Dope fiends and O.G's bout to take a tango
Chickens in a bucket supreme, young hoes dream
Cash rules everything in town, know what I mean?
Snowin' like Alaska, wanted in Nebraska
Bitch tryed to testify I straight blast her
K's and the ammo, modern-day Rambo
Got a glock some woks and a gram hoe
Got a Mazerati bumpin' like Jon Gotti
Red beams on the scene leave a bloody body
I got this shit locked up
Manny Fresh the special man a.k.a. Big Nutts

Chorus
",Niggas Don't Understand
B.G.,"[B.G.]
Fuck all that asshole and papers on my mind
Trying to come up I need every single dime
5, 9, 6, 51, 09
Look out for me, give me something properly, 100g
Drop it on Ivana street to protect it
I'm up by 2:23 and some ozzies
I got a gang of B.G. to work the shit for me
A team with a little Terrance and a little g
Alfred, Onry and Billy
Crazy phat, and my nigga Tyree
So when my nigga come home I can put him on his feet
'cause I'm straight till the one put the drop on me
Run it through the one and only staller
It's a young G, nuthin else than a young baller
4 and a half, for you, 4 and a half for you
And an ounce for you, I got coc for the whole crew
I'mma roll and show the rest of my niggas
Everybody I pay got the finger on the trigger
I just busted be	 on his 200 g's
He called DC and order 20 more keys
I got K-see and Sam running on his brother
In pewee running in the U.P.T.
3 showed up, and the roofed came down on BFD
We got it all, so show us the 17
The B.G. is on top of Shacollars
Dream came true by becoming a young baller

Chorus:
Baby order 20 keys, hand em over to me

[B.G.]
Shits getting fleded, I got mine

It's the dumbest shit, I'mma take it bust your shit
Now some rookies trying to show me up
Ain't that a shame now I gotta bring out the beast in me
I'm a jack so I gotta bring out the kid in me
Act to flack of the 3 OD
Clowns should've done what they did to me
Bust hollow tips slugs
And they nasty ass
Digging dirty from behind my stash and cash
100 g's, wit ease, nigga please
What I do for my years, and what I'ma do for my cheese
I learned from the best, had to pass the test
Ain't nuttin but a left hole in the left side of my chest
Fuck wit me and you gonna learn
And you gonna get snuck, motherfucker what's up
Ballers walk me out all night
And kibblers dogs with silly ass falls
I'm slippin, how you figure nigga
It takes street smarts to be a young baller

Chorus

[B.G.]
Now I'm bout my grip, gotta get my cheese
Gotta bout be my skrees, bustin niggas to they knees
I'm coming through your house with the glocs
Do whatcha got, I got a chopper
I gotta trunk full of funk for the haters
I'm always in the paper, me and my niggas are cappers
I'm hustler, bitch bustla, body disgusta
I'm the nigga you can't trust, I'm a fuck ya
Seein niggas comin down from Cali
They say ""yay"" it's 4:00 friday
They come and serve some people a couple of keys
I gotta hits it, I don't know, they gotta leave
Fix the sleeve, meet me in the medigree
At the tele, they gonna get buried
I already got it, straight down flat
Run in and out, click clack of packs
4 niggas 4 keys, 4 tryin to play
I gotta correct it, split it 4 ways
I'm about having things, that's all I've been hoping
It's open, so lets bust the town open

I done done it all from jackin' and slangin' nigga trust that
Stealin' cars snortin' dope gettin' bust at
Never goin' ta school all kinda bull-shit
They callin' my moma in I got her lookin' unfit
But look it ain't Cint fault I turned out this way
Its my fault she told me right from wrong everyday
When my daddy got killed I think that's when I went a stray
Mark Nell L.T. and me made niggas lay on they face
We was about that gunplay and on the grind
We was on a paper chase we wanted ta shine
Gotta get it how you live where the fuck I'm from
Gotta keep it on the real where the fuck I'm from
Growin' up in the streets best believe its dangerous
They lock us up but the jail ain't changin' us
You'll make it how i live if you don't mind dyin'
Growin' up in my shoes best believe was hard times nigga

(Chorus) 2x
Hard times got a nigga in all black
I'm goin' jack for that silver pack where its at
Hard times got the B.G. drove nigga
Hard times got me duckin' them white folks nigga

Its a hard time comin' up where I'm from like a twister spinnin'
Don't get caught in it
Its drastic drama its everyday life whoa
Jackin' is a way of livin 'if you ain't on the right road
I move fast my people say I need ta slow down
Close ya nose or ya gonna go down
I'm beefin' with different sets I'm duckin' them white folks
Playin' my hoes close
They tied up like a rope
I'm slangin' tryin' ta make a million and chill
Buy a ten story buildin' and a football field
Diamonds round my neck and wrist plenty golds in my grill
Niggas gone get holes in they head if they don't keep it real
My mama cryin' 'cause she think I'ma get my head bust
But I tell her growin' up with no daddy is rough
Welfare ain't enough
And I want to shine
So I'm goin get mine nigga and get out these hard times whoa

(Chorus) 2x

Me and my niggas buyin' cars don't give a fuck what its costin'
Neighborhood superstar Hot Boy$ bout flossin'
Crossin any of us get that put in a coffin
You don't hear we loss a shoot-out very often
We ballin' 
Shot callin'
Walkin' to the top
And when we get there believe we closin' shop
I'm lettin' my law down makin' Gs nigga
I done been through them hard times I'm makin' chesse nigga
Me and Fresh can hook up and make a hit with ease nigga
Fade me the B.G. pretty please nigga

Money go-getter
Drivin' expedition
Bet a bitch quick and put another hoe in her position
Riches is what I'm chasin' everyday nigga
Killin' bustas bringin that bitch in my way nigga

You were on the front row wearing that black gown
These rookies reppin' I done saw more, what ya'll den seen
Don't let me catch ya down bad, from the 3 to the 13

",Intro (Big Tymers)
B.G.,"Ah ha, look
You'll never see me hangin' from no tree
You would see me hoppin' out a new Bentley
You'll never catch me broke on my ass
You would catch me gettin' head in a Jag
Won't see me jockin' a hoodrat ho
Would see me browsin' on a Benz show floor
Never no more see me on a block with rocks
Stuffed in my 'Bauds: see two plastic glocks
You won't see me with this ride I rented or stole
Only when I'm in it if it's a two-triple-o
That's the new life for lil' B.G.
Bubbles and Hummers, Burbans with TV's
Beamers and 'Lacs, bikes, Tahoe's and Volvo's
Prowlers and PT Cruisers for lo-lo's
Change the paint on Excursions - drop her when we swervin'
Change the letter from Ford to Hot Boy, ya heard me

[Chorus x2]
Ah ha - I'm shinin', I'm blingin', I'm iced out
Ah ha - so hot, hoes can't keep my name out they mouth
Ah ha - I ride Benz, Jags, and fly jets
Ah ha - gotcha wonderin' what Geezy gon' do next

You'd see me pimpin' a Bentley, blunted out
In a Benz on my way to the line, stunted out
Hoes see me comin', they runnin' out
To the street to hop in the passenger seat to give me mouth
You know it's very often you'd see
Out in the streets, nigga flossin' like B.G.
When I do it, I do it like no one else
Chain fuck their vision up - got 'em hollerin' ""help""
So you know it gotta be nice, gotta be bright
Nothin' less than ten karats 'll stop blue ice
Baguettes 'round the end - all in the middle: flooded
It's princess-cutted - can't do nothin' but love it
That's a example for ""Hater, don't give me my props""
Can't be 'round that type 'cause he'll baller block
Fuck with me, your head missin' - the bitch gone
Body alone
Nigga, I'm tryin' to get my shine on

[Chorus x2]

Neck worth twenty, wrists worth forty, ears worth ten
But to me that ain't nothin' to spend
Car worth eighty, inside worth 'bout thirty
Can't put it on the street 'til buttons on her feet
But the gear don't change: still wear Ree's, still wear 'Bauds
Still wear T's - you know how it go
Now check this out: crib plushed out, worth about a mill
One on the water, one on the hill
Game don't change - still hustle to maintain
Ten stacks a month of bills to contain
Now, I'm ""Bling Bling Slim"" - you know him
Keep work stashed in all four of my rims
Two pearl glocks: one in my hand, one taped to the dash
'cause I gotta ride like that
Stay schemin' on paper, and more paper
'cause I want to be - gotta be - number-one bling-blinger

[Chorus]

Ah ha - I'm shinin', I'm blingin', I'm iced out
Ah ha - so hot, hoes can't keep my name out they mouth
Ah ha - I ride Benz, Jags, and fly jets
Ah ha - gotcha wonderin' what Geezy gon' do next

Ah ha - I'm shinin', I'm blingin', I'm iced out
Ah ha - so hot, hoes can't keep my name out they mouth

Ah ha - I'm shinin', I'm blingin', I'm iced out

Ah ha - I ride Benz, Jags, and timed Vettes
Uh-oh - gotcha wonderin' what Geezy gon' do next

My lil' nigga, Geezy, say he needed a stack (For sure)
Fronted my lil' wodie a ounce of crack
The bricks look the same, but them youngsters be strapped
From snortin' dope smokin' momo's, and jackin'

Word got around that a nigga was paid (Yeah?)
Supplied the whole uptown - word was said (Yeah?)
With quarters and halves (Yeah?), chickens and bricks (Yeah?)

'Cause bitches be catchin' conversation inspectin'
And fuck up and give them people some bad information

Now point the nigga out if he wan' do it with me
Step to the front of the line, let me see who you be
Air and opportunity that ain't nothin' to me
Look, I got somethin' I'm totin' that'll cut you in three
(One, two, three, kick it)

You're a certified clown in my eyes
That's the reason why half of your hood got shit bags on your side
You talk a good game but you a ho when they ride
Nigga don't have to look for you, they know you inside

You probly got your tail in your ass, your thumb in your mouth
Protected custody so you don't come in your house
Motherfucker, where all the shit you said you was 'bout?
Let you tell it, you been 'bout bustin' heads in the south

Can't be fuckin' with no lame, fake
Ain't even gon' watch your back, nigga
Get popped, can't handle the pressure and rat, nigga
Take the whole clique down runnin' his lips
Can't come back in the bricks now, he'll get flipped

It's a cold game but I don't give a fuck, my nigga
I feel threatened by anybody, I'ma bust that nigga up my nigga
Then go get a mill, fuck my bitch
I take this game to heart, unless niggas disagree

Now point the nigga out if he wan' do it with me
Step to the front of the line, let me see who you be
Air and opportunity that ain't nothin' to me
Look, I got somethin' I'm totin' that'll cut you in three
(One, two, three, kick it)

I'm a lil' man, stand my ground no matter what
Glock glued to my hand, there's no one you can trust
Niggas turned on they own nigga behind Geez
If I think they won't turn on me, I'm outta luck

So I roll first, cock and shoot first
Gotta stay over the head to duck a T-shirt
You want beef? You want war? You want me?
Nothin' between us but air and opportunity

Don't talk 'bout what you gon' do, do it, nigga
'Cause you're wastin' your breath, go 'head, prove it, nigga
Shit's real, I ain't got time to fake
Time's money, I ain't got time to waste

But on the straight with me bein' real
To let others' niggas know I don't fake, ya gotta get killed
Oh, bitch-nigga playin' with a rich nigga like me
Ya wind up six feet, clown

Now point the nigga out if he wan' do it with me
Step to the front of the line, let me see who you be
Air and opportunity that ain't nothin' to me
Look, I got somethin' I'm totin' that'll cut you in three

Step up, wherever the fuck you is, nigga
Don't throw a motherfuckin' brick
And hide your hand like a ol' pussy-ass, nigga

Come out to the light, nigga, let me see who you is?
You wan' do me somethin' or harm my kids, nigga, show your face
Make it known you're beefin' with me, know wh'I'm sayin'?

But you know I'm a soldier - nigga try me, I'll spank him

And when I touch down, me and her gonna get us some powder
Shorty, I've been hearin' that you've been wilin' out
Everyday of the week, until the club close down
What's happenin' with you, wodie? You doin' that 'cause we bound?
You doin' that 'cause for this lil' time I'm not around?
Don't get the game twisted - girl, better not try your luck

Over, she tried to pull 1 on quick
I'm paperchasing, trying to get rich
On a 68 tour with my clique
She hit me while I'm on the floor and was like
Ain't shit bad cause moms finna unite
I say bad, when its cool
But now, check what this hoe do
Slickly moving momma in my house

Break lamps, wasting food and leaving stains

Kids jamming tapes in my VCR
Flipping my TV like a light switch
God can only stop me from killing this bitch

I'm pissed off, mad and disgusted
Bitch tryna give me a excuse

You ask the mind state, to do the bad
You ain't said nothing bout cha whole fam
Look at my shit, it's fucked up

So why he down visiting, he staying wit me
I put him under surveilence longer than a week
He don't put 100% in his hygenes
He lied and stopped bout what he doing be in the streetz
He eating, he shitting, he sleeping, all for free
He ain't cleaning behind his self, he think it's the double tree
I'm almost to the point to ask him
what's happening? But I know, he get smart, I'ma slap him
Now I gotta leave him by his self for the weekend
I gotta fly to handle business in Cleaveland
I jet and this nigga go through my phone numbers
Call em', tell him I got him a surprise party, come over
So happen that I'm finished a day early
And decide to fly back home and check on this bitch

I ain't scared at all - my nuts hang low, wodie
Try sizin me up, that ass gotta go, wodie
Six under the dirt
Is where you'll be fuckin' with this nigga: Turk
I'll knock your head off, put your back in your chest
Play the same twitch straight to the project
Just chill - sit back and lay low
Stay on my p's and q's - keep the four-four
You know how it go: give bitch-niggas hell
And I'll make sure they'll never get well

(Hook [Turk & B.G.])

I got bad nerves - don't make me click if I do
What happen after I finish with you is on you
I warned you - you can't never say I didn't
Brains painted on the ground when I stop spittin'
""To society I'm a menace"" is what the judge said to me
Trippin' 'cause I keep a automatic that's fully
Finger stay on the trigger - see my enemy, I'm pullin'
Bitch-nigga say he feel me, laughed at me, say I wouldn't
You know Geezy couldn't let that slide by
I do walk-up's, never drive-by's
Grab a nigga by his head, whisper to him 'fore I do him
""Why,"" I said, ""you're here, wodie?"" - execute him
That there raw, huh - I know, nigga
Geezy ain't no ho, nigga
Been cutthroat, been playin' the game how it go, nigga
So if you like livin', mind your own business
Or you gonna be traced in white chalk, ya here me

We taking care of the whole section, with liquor
Marijuana smoke in the back, where Gar be at
Big trucks on 22's, loud sounds with screens
Who up in there, that got them chickens fixing they hair
And getting naked full of Cristal, that's the lifestyle
So I hit the club, with a pocket full of Lifestyles
Ooh shorty getting wild, now put your hands in the air
While you do that dance, and let me get behind you
While you in front of my man, in front of your man
Chill gun on my waist, with a blunt in my hand
We spending a grand on Bubbly, round for round
That's how the Chopper City mob, get down
Hydro in the bottle, with the yellow wrapper
And you players better, hold your broads
Cause these boys, will snatch her

Get your ass on the dance floor
And let Moet, and Cristal flow

I hold it down full of Mo' and Crown, it make the kid move
Quick, too much Vodka make me nervous bad
I'm popping bottles every hour, making Erkles mad
I left the scene, swerved past in a purple Jag
You heard of trap, ladies love me you perverted fags
I rock the house like it's church, yeah I love the Lord
Play with my team, Chopper City it's goin' be murder mass you heard me
Know you love the way that gangstas play it, we drank and blazing
Till ancient ages, this ain't for babies
So ease your nerves, play your girl like she easing surf
Cause chill what's beneath my shirt, have you bleeding syrup
I ain't tripping if you need that work, Sniper pull up in a Viper
With a rifle, that'll mean your smirk

And you know, where I'm found in here
Last week they had a body, left found in here
And with the drank getting smoked, the bottles is popping
We ain't even make it to the party, and girls jocking
It's Hakizzle, you know the name girl
Just write your number down, and I'll give you a ring girl
I don't mean, to snatch your chicks player
But the bar need chips player, look at my wrist player
The hood call me, Young Neno
Cause I'm quick to snatch your senorita, or hit the block with a kilo
Calm down homeboy, you messing up my groove

Wassup man
Look, this for my people
You heard me my dog
Man I miss my dog
My dog know I miss him to
But I feel it man
I feel them all in my heart
I know you right here, right with me
Man just riding on with his niggas
You heard me, I miss a lot of people
They know I miss them to
Look

[Verse One]
Nigga took care for my heart
When they killed my dog
Ruined every last dream that we had to ball
Me and this nigga was like brothers
Since we was small
I needed anything he was the first I'd call
He was down the road with me
If I got in beef
By fucking them hoes with me
He was H-O-T
Kept it real and representing
Via-13 got a little girl
I treat like it's for me
and a lot of hoes conversation
It's B.G and L.T.
Never had a friend like him
He never had a friend like me
Snorted half a grand of dope
On the flight together
Broke trying to make all night together
Now Lil' Ten gon' be a part
Of my life forever
Wish Lord wouldn't of took you to rest you
Look me and my dog broke bread together
Hot, fucking hoes in the same bed together

[Chorus]
Of top, it's all gravy, you in six feet
Just remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left out here solo
I'm doing the damn thing for me and you both
Off top, it's all gravy, you in six fett
But remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left me out here solo
But I'm fucking hoes for me and you both

[Verse Two]
1997, November I had bad days in my life
It looked like that was the worst
Niggas shot my round like a dog
Left him for dead
Chest bust wide open
Non-stop he blead
Just the day before we talked about gettin sober
In the blink of an eye
My whodi life is over
I know there's a good reason
Why the good Lord chose you
I know when your at your real
Cause down here you was a soldier
Always said ""Do it, it can't be faded""
Always said ""Do it you gon' make it""
And I made It
I wish you were here to see
It's all gravy, I know you want me to let that be
Man I hate it
I know you don't want me to be weak
So when I sheine, you shine
It's off the T-O-P
You was the Livin' Legend in the UPT
Do me a favor you and my daddy look down on me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You should see I'm balling out of control
I just got a deal with Cotsh for six zeros
And I had to be heavenly baby and niggas was hoes
They wasn't playin the game
Hot Gold, it's over, it's cool
I'm a gangsta in the game I know the street rules
And I miss all my people that's resting in peace
And I miss all my people that's six feet deep
You heard me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Believe that
You know I'm holding it down ya heard me
Man I miss you with a passion dog
But I know where you at
You know what I'm sayin, that you holding down
And I know you got a place for me
And I know you done met my daddy ya heard me
And y'all done got the fahotion y'all know what I'm sayin
Ya'll just looking down and sayin
""Man that little nigga doing hid thing""
'Cause I am doing my thing
And kiss my grandma for me ya heard me
Man do that for me dog
Kiss both of them for me ya heard me
I'm sayin man I'll see you when I get there
And I got to say Rest In Peace to all my dogs uptown ya heard me

I know you trying to feel where I've been
Laid back, ducked off, paper chasing
Ducking, dodging the pen
On the road trying to make it shake
Rap hustlin' from state to state
I got cheddar to make
Also got cash for days
Pies to push, blocks to move
Coke to sell 36 ounces for 22
And I still got the block in me
Glock with me, feds post up watching me
Me and my clique got a shop
Bust the game wide open
Once it was down man you know we had to hold it
All of the sudden niggaz head's start swelling
Money, fame, and power turn niggaz heads to melons
Mo money, mo feddy, mo niggaz got greedy

How you gone not break bread with B. Geezy?
Break bread with B. Geezy
You don't want me to shine nigga

You pushed me to this point nigga
Now you bout to get burnt nigga

You know Geezy was the G'est in the clique nigga
Remember I used to come and getcha
You remember begging Miss Cita to let me baby sit ya
Dog your under me
Your whole life you studied me
Tryin to be one of me
You ain't ready Dwayne Carter
You let Baby put cables on you

B.G.,"I was born 1980 September 3rd
That's the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made be	's n see's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's 'cause I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hair
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
I´m a cut this boy short 'cause my moms was involved

You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Nah cakes to be baked but she had cakes in the owen
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now I would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round that's when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
That's when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
That's when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habbit and markie was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog

Dawg I'm realer, just cooler, so smoother than you ever could be
I always put the hood in my rap
Cause I ride through the trap, no strap, hoe face in my lap
I'm a man I be holdin my own
Disrespect me if you want and I could promise you a whole in ya dome
I'm off the block when they play for keeps
And I was taught don't ride wit a nigga who ain't solid wit me
You got somethin to say then say it to me
Don't talk behind my back, be a man homie brang it to me
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin, start paper chasin and get ya game up

[Chorus: B.G]
Get ya game up
Nigga get ya game up
If it cost less than 10 then put that chain up
Get ya game up
Nigga get ya game up
If it cost less than 10 then put ya chain up
Get ya weight up
Nigga get ya weight up
You see me comin, you stuntin man pick ya face up
Get ya weight up
Nigga get ya weight up
You see me comin, you stuntin man pick ya face up

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Look, I went from broke to rich
Rich to back do'
Broke then back to gettin 20 thousand a show
I went from weed to dope
Dope to speed ballin'
Cleaned myself for me I'm a fuckin moneyholic
Hoes just love how I carry myself
I look in the mirror sometimes and wanna marry myself
I be lookin when a nine got this swag to myself
Most of it came from my daddy, a lil' Slim left
I'm a fool from the UPT
When I ask Hot Girls, What it do
They say do it to me
I'm official anywhere on the globe
I could travel around the world in 30 days with 30 different hoes
Man, I'm back and I'm outta control
Man, I'm floodin the bank until they see they can't hold no mo'
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin, start paper chasin and get ya game up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I ain't a mobbster, but Gizzle is made
I'm a tell ya, real niggas respect the game
Bustas feel played
Real niggas can go in hood
Cause real niggas do what they want, bustas do what they could
On the real, I'm like the law of the streets
I could pull up, hop out, and leave my keys in the car on the streets
Nigga know what come behind fuckin wit me
Mo' murder, mo' kill, mo' headbussin' fuckin wit me
So I advise you to stay on your level
Niggas stay in your place
Be smart just stay out the way
Dawg, just stay in your league
Cause its a lot of lions, tigers, and bears
Runnin through these trees
And believe, I'm the king of the jungle
I'm the coach of the team
I can't mess wit the scope and a beam
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin', start paper chasin' and get ya game up

[Chorus]
",Get Ya Game Up
B.G.,"Oh no, no, oh no, no
Cut the music please
Oh no, no, oh no, no, oh no, no

I play the bulls*** from the backseat champ
Yea I'm in the backseat still got the seat back
Feet back stay from where the fake be at
N****s snitch for the shine where the patience at
N**** make his own brother face his back
Give love and take it back
Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats
Face the facts you can't change him can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him if he kill you then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya
Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on a wet pavement
Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take 'em
Hollygrove Hollygrove was his last statement
So n**** get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me w-e-e crooked letter ""Y"" I'm so high
I skeet skeet in any n**** dime like she's mine
Street sweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in ya speakers from the chopper blast
Like, ha ha
That's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hopping back
It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back
No c***ing back silly motherf***er you ain't heard bout this
The clips ain't down to the dick
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you b****es from by me
When I hit every piece of ya visible body he leakin'
Mortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'
While you p**** n****s is sleeping he thinking
Deep in thought the boy ain't even winkin'
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came
Though I bear a name only one call live with
Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it
I'm sicker with it
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo' about dough
Nothing! man the four wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank-top pocket fan
No pocket knife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat boom!
Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price
Cause to each its own and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house big momma's house
She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out
And he ain't getting up after them shots 
If you hit him in the right spot
Hold up the beat might drop

Oh no, no, oh no, no",Roll with Me

It's get it how you live with me
Busters don't know how to deal with me, it's all real with me
All the street niggas scared of me
All the hot girls love me they say ""boy put that drill in me""

How could you react, if your brains are blown
I guess that fat bitch is singin' her song, that bitch is singin' her song
You busted wide, little boys ain't grown
Your mouth is heavy but your back ain't strong, and once again it's on
You must be smokin' on that cheech and chong
Think you can handle with somethin' this wrong, with somethin' this wrong
Just write it in blood, or carve it in stone
Otherwise you don't want no problems with homes, don't want no problems with homes

B.J. The Chicago Kid,"For someone start with my nigga out Mack
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Whenever that he see it's chains swang
But that's that Jesus 2 slots
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of raze braided by his girl Lucy
With the semi on, make the head game kinda cold
Never kill the soul, so we never had a problem with thinking this [?]
Living life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dying like life really going full circle
Thought we was gonna live to see it all
Till that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle

It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner bur shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
Watching for some yellow diamonds
Yes I'm on the phone you losers
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
When I know when the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her [?]
He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they're both in my pants
I'm a gangster I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on tell you I love you baby
Caz tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series when a crown went crack nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They hate a black nigga with getting money's involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the axillae
If Q said it then you know that shit's real
Pistol grip up on my lap all times
I used to drive a Hyundai with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the lost that kill bay base kids
So the gun is who my role model is, the illest crip in the biz
Look, I'm never half of my steppin', I never not with my weapon
So you'll get got in a second like

Cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

And you feel like you really got a guardian angel right now

B.J. Thomas,"Roads
Nameless roads
Where you takin' me to
Now we're movin' into country
These boots ain't traveled through
And I'm losing all my heart 
By going on
But the point of no returning
Is long gone

Roads
Hungry roads
Something feels mighty wrong
First you came to own my body
Now you're out to get my soul
And I can't tell which is you
And which is me
And I only have the hope of feeling free

Everybody's calling out directions
Telling me which way I oughta go
Now I never had a mind 
That took too kindly to direction
But lately I don't know
I just don't know

Roads
Lonesome roads
Are you anywhere bound
Does a man have to admit he's lost
Before he can be found
When the miles keep rolling by
And he's scared and he don't know why
Does he come right out and shout
I need a friend

Or does he let his roads
Just take him to the end",Roads
B.J. Thomas,"When I wake up in the morning feeling like
The night before
And the day comes crashing down around about the time my feet hit the floor
There ain´t nothing I know
Can fix me up fine
Like a little taste of lovin
Laced with sweet cherry wine

When I need a friend
And I recall that I ain't got a one
And I fell so doggone bored
Lord that dying sounds like it could be fun
There ain´t nothing I know
Can get me in line
Like a little taste of lovin´
Laced with sweet cherry wine

I said hey 
Hey
Nothing I know
Makes a body set up 
Get up and go
I said hmmmmm
So sweet and so fine
When I´m going to pot
I don´t need a lot 
Just give me a shot of sweet cherry wine

I just can´t do without it
Sweet cherry wine
There ain't no doubt about it
That nothing can warm up 
With sweet cherry wine

Sometimes they're sad
Sometimes they're lonely
And need to be told that they're loved
Everyone needs to be loved
Friends are like good wine

And I've had the best
I don't always show it
But no one knows better than I
So drink up

I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more

Friends are like warm clothes

In the night air
Best when they're old
And we miss them the most when they're gone

and live with your bad
But they want you and need you
When no one else knows your alive

For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why but I keep thinkin'
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize when she says

Don't worry baby
Ev'rything will work out all right
Don't worry baby (oh)

I guess I should-a kept my mouth shut
When I start to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because I
Pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to drive when she says

Don't worry baby
Ev'rything will work out all right
Don't worry baby (oh)

She said now baby when you race today
Just take along my love for you
And if you knew how much I loved you baby

B.J. Thomas,"Sometimes I wake up and the dark of night is creeping
And the early morning hush is all around
I wonder if any of my dreams are worth keeping
Or are they as foolish as they sound

There's so little time
And so much living
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down

B.J. Thomas,"Now your Father has told you
Son you're naive
To still be out lookin'
For something to believe
The realities of power
Are above your ideals
And he sure has good reasons
For the way that he feels

For man has never hesitated
To do violent deeds
To ravage this earth
And take more than he needs
Can there be any doubt
To the size of his crimes
After all that we've seen
Within our own times

Oh but what kind of logic
In what kind of brain
What manner of man
Would think it was sane
What kind of soul
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace

There are those who will argue
It's all too complex
You must live past the present
To see it's effects
As if the peasant in the fields
Hearing planes in the sky
Waits for history to tell him
It's his turn to die

Now I'm sorry that you have to hear
These words tonight
They're not pleasant to sing
They're not pleasant to write
I know the tide of protest
Has passed us somehow
Oh but when do you speak out
If you don't speak out now

Tell me
What kind of logic
In what kind of brain
What manner of man
Would think it was sane
What kind of soul
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace

B.J. Thomas,"Funny how you can go on livin'
And lose the simple knack of givin'
It slips away before ya know it's gone
Ya build up walls and before ya know it
Someone moves you and you want to show it
But you just can't find a way of lettin' on

But I don't know how

Funny how you can cut off feelin'
And tell yourself your wounds are healing
When all you've done is turn the pain inside
And when your sure no one can get to ya
Someone smiles and it goes right through ya
And wakes up somethin' that you thought had died

That the sky seems to say good morning

Throw away all your blues

Upon your way
So won't you decide
To come back alive
It's a new day

Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like a new born baby child

Well I'm feeling so good
I keep knocking on wood
I'm not dreaming
I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air with a meaning
Sayin' its time to wake up
Get a whole new outlook
From your view
And come on out where it's warm
It won't do any harm
If you want to

B.J. Thomas,"City on a Sunday morning
Everybody's gone away
Seems to me I like it best that way
Standing on an empty corner
Caught up in a very funny mood today

Footsteps on the sidewalk
Echo on the avenue
6 AM the sun is peeking through
Lazy alley cat is sleeping
Whiling the time away
There's something about a city
Sunday morning day

Traffic jams
Garbage cans
Pushcart vendors
Big time spenders
All have gone away
That's why I love Sunday

The streets are all rolled up empty
I'm strolling down old Broadway
Sure looks like a peaceful town today
A hobo tips his hat good morning
And I tossed him a dime
On a city morning feeling fine

Traffic jams
Garbage cans
Pushcart vendors
Big time spenders
All have gone away
That's why I love Sunday

Is gettin' so hard to make
