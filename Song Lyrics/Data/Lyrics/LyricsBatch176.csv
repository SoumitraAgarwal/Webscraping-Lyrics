Ida McBeth,"Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)","Signed, Sealed, Delivered"
Ida Sand,"Chewing on a piece of grass
Walking down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?
Some people say this town don't look 
Good in snow
You don't care, I know

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer 
The nights are stronger
Than moonshine 
You're gonna go I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through
Your hair
And the days surround your daylight 
There
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air

Wishin' on a falling star
Watchin' for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by
Purple rain
Aw, come on Joe, you can always
Change your name 
Thanks a lot son, just the same

Ventura Highway
Where the days are longer 
The nights are stronger
Than moonshine 
You're gonna go I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through

And the days surround you daylight 
There

Ida Viper,"Many months have come and gone 
Since I wondered from my home
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many page in life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
Yet I feel that in those hills I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I'd ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboys life was my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As I'm standing here today 
I am many miles away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
chorus

As in life I turn a page 
To the land of the ole sage
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow white cotton grows
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born",Oklahoma Hills
Ida Viper,"Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me

Ida Viper,"Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
To many words, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love

Ida Viper,"My window faces the South
I'm almost halfway to heaven
Snow is falling, still I can see 
Fields of cotton calling to me
My window faces the South, 
And though I am far from the Swanee
I'm never frownin' or down in the mouth

And I've never even heard their songs

To join in their crusade

They can be antisocial just like us and 
They can choose their very own religion 
They can climb into bed in the 
Middle of the night and 
Sleep in your arms, as if hypnotized

I'm so disenchanting 
Intoxicated by my own tear's soul 
And come tomorrow 
When my beauty is old 
Like a speckled princess 
I'll try to cash in clovers for gold 
So I'll light a candle and begin to 
Write, turn to my work as refuge 

Though my womb is a rush hour taxi 
Ride, but I will try 
To metamorphose pain along my plight 
But I'll despise each word I write 
So I am clinging to the 
Edge, like some soap-opera star 
With her ten second fade 
As the light cascades 
Do you love me anymore?

Or are you just an intellect? 
Do you think about this now,
The girl who made you miserable 
In junior high, made you cry? 
Do you thinks she's smoking 
Like five packs of cigarettes a day 
And going to therapy... 
Wait I wasn't finished 

[Chorus]

Do you think it's normal 
For white people to wear dreadlocks? 
Are you a barefoot earthling 
Or a hermit in socks 
Guys in tuxedos are 
Kind of deceiving 
But you know, you see them in the park, jogging along 
It's a little more revealing 

Do you think about your funeral? 
If you died how many people 
Are gonna show up? 
Do you think we're capable of change 
Or we're just gonna, oh screw up our children? 
Do you think about fires,
Who do you rescue first 
Your kids or your sleeping husband?",Think Too Much
Idina Menzel,"Better To Have Loved
Ooh
Better To Have Loved...
Ooh
If the sun went down tomorrow and it never came back
And the city went quiet and we fade to black
Well I won't have a single regret
And I wouldn't trade a thing
Cause I never knew I could feel what I feel inside of me

[Chorus]
Better to have loved than never loved at all
Better to have dreamed than never taken the fall
Better to have loved you and let you in than never to have touched your skin
Better to have hurt and screamed and cried
Fall into the earth for a trip to the sky
Better to have loved
You

Better to have Loved:
I knew all the time I was taking a chance
When I stand there on the edge of the cliff and no one was holding my hand
Well the wind blew strong and the clouds rolled in and I, I felt us lift off the ground
Yes I bared my soul and I dared to go knowing one day you might let me down

[Chorus]

I gave you everything but to have said goodbye

[Chorus]
Better to have loved than never loved at all
Better to have dreamed than never taken the fall

I've lost my own reflection
And I can't look down
If you're not there to catch me when I fall

If this is the moment I stand here on my own
If this is my rite of passage that somehow leads me home
I might be afraid
But it's my turn to be brave
If this is the last chance before we say goodbye
At least it's the first day of the rest of my life
I can't be afraid
Cause it's my turn to be brave

All along all I ever wanted, was to be the light
When your life was daunting
But I can't see mine
When I feel as though you're pushing me away
Well who's to blame, are we making the right choices
Cause we can't be sure if we're hearing our own voices
As we close the door even though we are so desperate to stay

[Chorus]

And I might still cry
And I might still bleed
These thorns in my side
This heart on my sleeve
And lightening may strike
This ground at my feet
And I might still crash
But I still believe

This is the moment I stand here all alone
With everything I have inside, everything I own
I might be afraid

Idina Menzel,"I lie awake looking back
God knows this life goes fast
Each day harder than the last
Breaking down in the dark
I don't know how I fell this far from heaven
Can't put the pieces back together
So you lie there and dream

Here's to the lonely
To the broken-hearted
I want you to know I feel your pain
Here's to the hopeless
The almost forgotten
To those who got lost along the way
I see you, I see you, I see you

City streets and no one sees
We all just try to make believe
That it's all better than it seems
Black and white we color in
We see the world the way we wanna see it
You either take it or you leave it
Is it all just a dream

And you can't go back home
At the end of the day (I see you)

A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

You can leave here

Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look

From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door

So you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible

And go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible

I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen

Et bien que miséreux 
Avec le ventre creux 
Nous ne cessions d'y croire 
Et quand quelque bistrot 
Contre un bon repas chaud 
Nous prenait une toile 
Nous récitions des vers 
Groupés autour du poêle 
En oubliant l'hiver 
La bohème, la bohème 
Ça voulait dire 
Tu es jolie 
La bohème, la bohème

Souvent il m'arrivait

De passer des nuits blanches 
Retouchant le dessin 
De la ligne d'un sein 
Du galbe d'une hanche 
Et ce n'est qu'au matin

A mon ancienne adresse 
Je ne reconnais plus 
Ni les murs ni les rues 
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse 
En haut d'un escalier 
Je cherche l'atelier 
Dont plus rien ne subsiste

I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Ieshia Le,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
If All Else Fails,"Black, consume yourself in night.
Twinkling like the starlight fights the day. 
Stick your fingers in your ears. Shut your eyes and hum a tune. 
You're gonna need an alibi. 
The addiction's not your flaw, it's your unhearing feeble mind that seems to persecute what frightens you. And you thought what you forgot forgot you. 
No longer was true. 
Blissful ignorance you have. 
Moderation you have not. 
Killing yourself can be such fun. 
Pull the noose around your neck, cock the gun and prep the pill. 
Jump, pull. and swallow yourself through. 
Could you be so pretentious to think life not precious? 
A fucking ingrate to the world. 
Are you content spewing lies that further ostracize the individual you were? 
Blue, blanketed in earth. That while you eluded captures you.",Black & Blue
If All Else Fails,"Did you see when they opened your eyes there was something more to you? 
Nothing bitter and nothing contrived as the world around you grew 
Could you blame me for pointing you out? 
Could you blame my watchful eye? 

Something more, something concrete and real and an answer for the why 
Please say you know me, because you do Please say you love me, because you sacrificed, saw me through You were there for me When I could not see 
You opened my eyes 

Much to my surprise Did you always see into the hearts of the writer and the muse? 
Accentuating the glory of life as the body and mind fuse. 
I thank you now because you knew I was there, 
Because none can compare, because you helped me believe, 

Because the beauty now abounds the fury and the sound 
I thank you now Undeniable like the air we breathe 
Hidden fast like a sword we sheathe Blinding still like a focused light 
Morning comes in the midst of night 

Now you're gone and there's no one here Left me to fend, 
No regard to fear Paved the way for the road in store 
I'll always know you were there for me, you were there for me",You Were There

Sugar cane, back lanes

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something liking to loving
It was us against the world now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breath for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you leave for it
Til then having kids, can check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me

I miss you but pride won't let me tell you
Thought that we had all the time
But I'm guessing that plans fell through
Yeah, we fell off
I won't ask you to climb back
I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back
Was wrong too but I see it now
That you don't give a damn
I got you tatted, you took off before the ink dried on my hands
I was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell
I lied, tried to be perfect and I played myself
And it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that
'Cause you say you love me, but real love don't work like that
The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to date you

Rolex's don't tick-tock
But damn it baby, my time costs
And damn it baby, my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said, I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it baby, my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost

Say that you love me
I say that you're lying
'Cause I said we could work on it, you said ""let's leave it behind""
Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind
So how I see you know insulting me is wasting my time
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
Cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before
Another hard lesson, stressing taking personal notes
Remember sweet nothings, like baby, what's the purpose in those?
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that
But sometimes in love, it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back
You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that
And for all of y'all watching I hope that this entertain you
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you

'Cause the way is so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinking about it, ain't that far
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so flashy clean
Smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is it
Good girl bad guy, what a perfect match
And if I you, gonna wanna play baptized
'Cause when you finish you gonna feel like you was baptized
See baby now you're feeling for a test drive
'Cause you don't wanna loose your ride to the next guy

Gotta hold on me that's without a doubt
So clear now he's a trouble starter
But I ain't the same either and he's in no still water
Just cause I'mma get to file in extrophy
Don't mean nothing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

Just cause I'mma get to file in extrophy
Don't mean nothing to me

Smells like trouble to me
I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news)
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos (all of the tattoos)

I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news)
But I'm undecided trying to figure out if that's you (trouble to me)
Don't you come here thinking about it, ain't that far
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so flashy clean
Smells like trouble to me",Trouble
Iggy Azalea,"Right, Iggy back no playtime
I just gave y'all some break time to miss me
So stressed on what's next
My last little bit of success ain't even hit me
So keep it light on the advice
Look at us, we must be doing something right clearly
In convo I don't talk to too many
I just talk to the fans in the songs cause y'all feel me
Now let's reflect on what we left on New Classic
I overstepped what was expected, I blew past it
So best bet is respect my perspective
Or go get your sight checked for new glasses
The fact is you combine the stats with
The history I made, the message should be established
I guess what I'm explaining in laymen's

Tryna get the same type love and respect as peers I be rhymin' with
But everything is so one-sided, divided and biased
That I can't get a fair judge panel not in the slightest bit
In light of this, I had to write a hit to get this type of chip
Ridin' dick won’t get me nowhere and I ain’t that type of chick
That's so unladylike 'specially knowin' they be like
""Iggy this and Iggy that"" long as you say it, say it right
Right, they might be playin' but Iggy ain't
'Til Iggy faint, I just wanna fill this Iggy bank
See I emerged from the smoke without a smudge on me
So back up up off of me unless you got some love for me, right

Iggy Azalea,"He got a house that's too big
Sits on a hill in the valley
Said he trying to move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride 'cause I don't want us overlapping
Spendin' money on mac, that's cute, I get checks from them in paris
Better check my tax bracket
What you think was gonna happen
Naggin', now he's had it
And y'all fell off like mad men
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch
She's no housewife, just desperate
I know it's hard to let go but accept it

'Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
'Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
'his' and 'her' gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon' hate
They gon' have something to say

When I hop out his new six
Fresh in some new shit
Damn, she is too thick, who is this?
Yeah I'm his new bitch
I'm his new bitch
And I'm spending his new cash
Few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad
Oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch
Yeah, I'm his new bitch

She be the one that be like
Hey, girl, what's up? you in town?
Yes, I'm in town, kissing on the face, and you know this
So just say it

It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws
Driving, riding, all black suits up
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew
And what I do, it can't be compared
You well done and bitch I'm rare
So stop popping up unexpected
Stop sending threats and text messages
We too grown for this messy shit
This will be my last conversation
If you don't want no problems, move yourself from the equation

Tell your friends to tell their friends too
He got a new chick but it ain't you
I'm just saying, you know it's true
Cry a river and swim on through
I know you hoping we won't make it
Clyde and bonnie, let the world chase us
Ride or die where the world takes us
If we end up poor or rich and famous
I'm all he needs and more chick
His home chick
His tour chick
His 4th finger, left hand chick
And all those people go 'damn, chick'

No Michael Kors just Tom Ford

In Spain wearing that Balmain
Lanvin, Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse
I got ten toads in that concrete
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit
I don't need your money, I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know I'll put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six and he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with
They talk shit but we 'bout shit
Fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be, where he need to be
I tell him go on, it ain't no thing to me
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back
Would you let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high class ass when you met me
My money talk, it's too bad for y'all
Y'all know which shorty's Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet
Know every bitch you had ain't never had shit
Respect that, I won't come around, no run around

And the games, ain't gonna play none

You know how we ride
No credit, no debit, no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walking by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like Damn bitch, can't say hi?
Then I hop in the drop and I wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he not there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinking about it, you got no idea
Don't try me man, you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new rover whip
The fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there
No asking what you doing there
Imma send my crew in there
You two gonna be ruined there
You violate, I demonstrate
Especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual

Iggy Azalea,"I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me honey
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me honey
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

I'm gonna love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air And you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya

Iggy Azalea,"I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash, it just complicates things
And all this money that we into, it'll drive you crazy
But it only make me go harder, grow stronger
And get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
'Cause I don't want none of that fake love, 'cause I'm looking and all of that be made up

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends,
so for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway

I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all

Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall, feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stress more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute, now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talking about no money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking about VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
And so now I need money, put it all in my discussions

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?
Try to knock me down but I'm strong

I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all

And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over, be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down and then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my heart's on fly when you on top of the world sky high

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?
Try to knock me down but I'm strong

Iggy Azalea,"He got a house that's too big
Sits on a hill in the valley
Said he trying to move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride 'cause I don't want us overlapping
Spendin' money on mac, that's cute, I get checks from them in paris
Better check my tax bracket
What you think was gonna happen
Naggin', now he's had it
And y'all fell off like mad men
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch
She's no housewife, just desperate
I know it's hard to let go but accept it

'Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
'Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
'his' and 'her' gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon' hate
They gon' have something to say

When I hop out his new six
Fresh in some new shit
Damn, she is too thick, who is this?
Yeah I'm his new bitch
I'm his new bitch
And I'm spending his new cash
Few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad
Oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch
Yeah, I'm his new bitch

She be the one that be like
Hey, girl, what's up? you in town?
Yes, I'm in town, kissing on the face, and you know this
So just say it

It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws
Driving, riding, all black suits up
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew
And what I do, it can't be compared
You well done and bitch I'm rare
So stop popping up unexpected
Stop sending threats and text messages
We too grown for this messy shit
This will be my last conversation
If you don't want no problems, move yourself from the equation

'Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
'Cause we fly shit when we drop in

That I'm his new bitch
Yeah, I'm his new bitch

Tell your friends to tell their friends too
He got a new chick but it ain't you
I'm just saying, you know it's true
Cry a river and swim on through
I know you hoping we won't make it
Clyde and bonnie, let the world chase us
Ride or die where the world takes us
If we end up poor or rich and famous
I'm all he needs and more chick
His home chick
His tour chick
His 4th finger, left hand chick
And all those people go 'damn, chick'

Iggy Azalea,"Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here
I just hopped off that lier, my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
So I'm just climbing, pay that fine, and now I'm shining could be blinding
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
I'm what amazing look like, you'll recognize it when you see it

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones
This is the line, and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

I been counted out, I been stepped on
I was wide awake, and got slept on
I had everything and then I lost it
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted
All this talking about me, just talk about me
I'm here now, they can't walk around me
I'm dedicated, flow elevated
Tell every hater I hope you never play it, said I'd never make it
Now I'm celebrating, I'm never quitting, no resignation
I'm the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds, so I threw them off in this chain
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game
Cause I'm gonna get it
And that's for sure
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go
International, and y'all local
Got this locked up just like popo
Every beat get A, that's tocho
Won't lose, oh no, that's Yoko
Been up and down like Lolo's
Still make my own on the solo
Had to be here to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let you know that I mean it
If I speak it, I say keep it
This flow, that's genius
Just think about it, would I think about it?
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what?

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones
This is the line, and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

And everything ain't the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and they never landing

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones
This is the line, and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

Of forbidden content

Iggy Pop,"Well gather round people
And listen to this
I am a hermit of burial ridge
Once I was shaven and worked every day
But the call of the wild just lured me away
Singing hi hi ho it's a water a day
On my way to an unmarked grave
Hi hi ho it's a water a day
On my way to an unmarked grave

There's pals at my table and mud on the floor
There's bears in the area and wolves at the door
Their singing a song about cookie McBride
Who goes out a-trapping and then tails their hide

Hi hi hey it's a water a day
On my way to an unhappy grave
Hi hi hey it's a water a day
On my way to a rain filled grave
So if you're planning a natural trip
Don't call up snooping on burial ridge
The searchers will come and discover your hide
High, wet and hanging like cookie McBride

Hi hi hey it's a water a day
On your way to an unhappy grave
Hi hi hey it's a water a day
Who will remember the money you saved?

I gotta go out and catch a mouse
I can't be wrong so I gotta be right

It's eat or be eaten

Something's hungry like a hunter
And it's probing like a finger
As the drumbeat keeps things hurrying
That's the part that's so appealing

It's the beat that dominates
Each breath you draw
Each step you take
Strike or be stricken

Eat or be eaten yum yum yum yum
Eat or be eaten

Your skills are highly specialized
But still that girl can magnetize
You sense the hunger in her eyes

It's beat or be beaten

There's no softness in her eyes
A weird dull glint is in her eyes
With a stubborn will to tantalize

Like some cheap devil in disguise
And it's troubling me
Hell it's nervy that's what it is

Eat or be eaten
Beat or be beaten
Strike or be stricken

The night is dark the night is pulp
Tilt back your head and take a gulp
Of air that's screamed a thousand times

The main thing is to victimize
It's just the night for a conquering tribe
Oh, it's just the night for a conquering tribe

Eat or be eaten
Beat or be beaten

Faster than the arrow flies
Or the man who smiles while he lies
It's just the night for a conquering tribe
And the girls are calling in her yellow dress

That girl is calling in a yellow dress
She says eat eat eat here boys
Eat eat eat here boys

With blinking eyes
The worthless stands
In readiness
For transport to

There's dirty work
Ahead of them

And quite a bunch they are

What do you do with a life of work?

Face it in the morning
Face it in the morning
And the parting of the ways
And the interrupted mirth
And the shock that has to come

And it only hurts
When it hurts

Have left me with my soul today
Felicity flies out the door
When people lose their warmth
That's a very ordinary bummer
I'll hold out for summer days

Stand and laugh and run
In a quiet movie of mine
I saw a girl with eyes like fire
I had to look away
She was swearing like a sailor
And demanding her own way
That was when I knew I had to love her

I opened up my sad old eyes
And let the feelings run
With a quiet beauty of mine
Maybe sometimes we do bad things
And then other times we do good
And sometimes from something very bad
Comes something very good
In a quiet year of mine",Ordinary Bummer

As your head hang bloody from your elbow

Iggy Pop,"Strategic angles indirectly revealed
Uniting human form and manufactured heels
Go buy in a hurry, buying your chance
You give your best by loving a classic
Immoderation seems to suit her best
But then I turn around and she's very delicate

Go buy in a hurry, get all you can
Give her your best ?
Time has no pull on her soul
When she is here I'm her doorman
I'm ?

Until the fire made him cry

Run like a villain to the sugar bowl
Run like a villain cause you can't adjust
To a saccharine suburb in the mush

Darker than the tombs of Egypt,
Dumber than the crudest fiction,
Buried in a melting coffin

Prescription shades and designer jeans
A sony walkman on her head

Iggy Pop,"You gave me a present
The paper was blue and green
I unwrapped it with pleasure
These are the best shades I've ever seen
You can be my girlfriend
Forever and a day
I never thought I was worth much
Or that anyone would treat me this way

[Chorus:]
I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you
It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I could have had a problem
I might have never followed through
The other guys are in trouble
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you
These shades say something
I'll bet they cost a lot
I hope I don't break 'em
I hope we don't break up

Iggy Pop,"Winners and losers which one am I,
Is it the same under the sky?
Black motorcycles and the will to survive
Losers and winners low and high

In this glass and wire world
Surely leeches gain the right
To send their message screaming
One that has no meaning

To people who feel
Questions and questions plain as your nose
But who would believe a little rose?
Winners and losers in love with themselves

No Santa Claus no happy elves
In this smoking gun existence
It gets harder to unwind
I'll just eat my breakfast

Try to keep my questions
Starving all night
Out in the suburbs I met
My true fine love

Down in the suburbs I met
My true fine love

She gave me money
She gave me head
She gave my everything

And then she went dead
Stick out your thumb
And hit the open road
Cat in a mercedes

Goes by, he's old
He's got some, you got none
Together maybe you can have

Iggy Pop,"I played tag in the auto graveyard
I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate while they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, uh-huh

Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called ""Drive the Wheel""
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha
Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win
And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street
Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky
Cold metal, got to be
Skeleton of the free
Cold metal, it's gotta be
Better save a tree
Save a tree, save a tree, save a tree, save a tree

You burned my heart
With a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
Candy baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out
But I miss you
I've had a hole in my heart
For so long
I've learned to fake it and
Just smile along

Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love
Not games
Not games

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
Candy, candy , candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
I know baby
Candy baby

You you you
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy candy candy
Life is crazy
Candy baby

Iggy Pop,"People are so sad and I know why
With no chance to live before you die
You get pretty sick if you have to
Keep it inside

I wanna build a house where an ad don't scream
I wanna live in peace-quietly
I wanna have a place of love and safety
People ought to live how and where they want
People ought to have respect in front
People ought to get along pretty O.K.

So get off my dick
I'm building it brick by brick
Brick by brick

I'm building a house where I can think
And have some balance and dignity
I'm building a house where no one can hurt me
I'm building a house where the weak are strong
I'm building a house with a real song
I'm using faith that is immortal
I'm building it with simplicity
And the way that we feel, you and me
I'm building it with what I believe in

So get off my dick
I'm building it brick by brick
Brick by brick

Now I'm looking at just a little time
So be it I want to
Be true to my simple heart
And not put nothing else above it

Iggy Pop,"I was gently raised 
Fussed over r in school 
Fed and housed and entertained 
Wanting to be cool 
Summers in the grass 
Winters warm and slow 
Until the one thing on my mind was to just 
Get up and go 

We're the undefeated 
We got what they want 
We're so bored and spoiled 
Life is just a bag of pot 
We're the undefeated 
TV in the shade 
Girls at all our parties 
We have really got it made 

There's a real mean world outside 
Where many lives are lost 
But struggle builds character 
And we are growing soft 
I don't want to sit and watch no TV show 
I want to roam and be challenged 
I want to grow and grow 

We're the undefeated 
We got what they want 
We're so fucking spoiled 
Life is just a bag of pot 
We're the undefeated 
TV in the shade 
Girls at all our parties 
We have really got it made 
What have we made? 
A giant jail 
A bunch of walls 
That's all that we've made 
Oh, my 

We're the undefeated we got what they want 
We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot

Iggy Pop,"They call me Mr. Dynamite
I blow things up in black and white
An end to your charade
A button I have made must be pushed

There is no reason for the sky
When I'm on fire with your lies
So if I can win this fight
Then call me Mr. Dynamite

So here we stand
Both you and I
We're face to face
But eye to eye?
Tomorrow you may change
And I would be betrayed, my friend

Oh mommy mommy mommy
Do you remember Mr. Dynamite?
You know that guy from down the block
He blew things up in black and white

Yesterday he changed
Today he is betrayed

On the ground
The neighbors gather 'round

Poor Mr. Dynamite",Mr. Dynamite
Iggy Pop,"I'm the kind of girl
I want that whole wide world
Nothing more nothing less
I don't want second best

Ah but my associates
Why they're no more than opiates
Always dragging me down
Dash my hopes to the ground

But they must be kidding
Or wishful thinking
Adding fuel to the fire
Of my ambition

I'll make a date
Oh no I won't be late
And why of course he'll be there
He'll promise he'll swear

But all I ever find
Been spun that same old line
It's happened time and time again before
But these things and more
Widen the score

And it's one up for ambition
I really have a go
You know you've got to hand it to me
I've got a heart of gold
But I'm a wolf in mutton's clothes

Someday my time will come
I'll feel I can't go on
I may not care or even know it's there
But then I'll have my fun

So 'till then just press on
Don't lose your grip
Don't lose ambition",Ambition

They're making sorta crazy sounds

I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down...no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to Shanty Town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down...no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down...no
Don't look down
Don't look...don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

I don't look down
From Central Park to Shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound

For these four walls I love

And nothing ever hurts

Where is the wine?

I was quickly surrounded by some beautiful queens.
I looked to my left then I looked to my right,
I spoke to that one girl that looked out of sight.

Someone who will come along
Instead of coming on

Anp the forces ebb and flow
And the money goes and goes
And something makes you
Want to throw a brick
Through the window

It's just that social life
It's got you on the run
That goddamn social life
It's torture dressed as fun
It's just that social life
They got you chasing strings
That goddamn social life
And you are seeing things",Social Life

With a butchy girlfriend

They took me to the alley
To have a little chat

I was glad that Debbie
Had a sense of humor
This time of the morning
I tend to get gloomy
She laughed and said Iggy

I had no reply
So I just closed my eyes

Made my head go alright and 'round
She was dressed to kill the pope
And what she did she gave me hope
I smiled back without no sound

Trouble won't leave me alone

Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots
They live the dream and they went non-stop
They did' ok 'til the band broke up

Look away look away look away look away

Unfortunately the needle broke
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone
She was selling something that I was on

Look away look away

Now thunder and me did not part friends
What we did once I wouldn't do again
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon 
'til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon

Look away look away

So a few years later thunder died broke
Sable had a baby back at her folks
Me I went straight and serious too
There wasn't much else that I could do

Iggy Pop,"The other day I was walking down 14th Street
It was a beautiful summer day
The sun was shining
And I found myself surrounded by Latin American and dark women

And as I looked at their ankles,
Their knees and their thighs,
And the curve of their bodies,
Their mysterious eyes
I couldn't help but thinking about their pussies
And I asked myself

Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Pussy, pussy walk

Now you know from time to time
My musical group and I have occasion to visit
The high schools, jr. high schools and
Other centers ol learning in this wonderful land of
The united States of America
And when I do, from time to time
I run into the young girls that attend these places
And I see them smiling at me with their young girl clothes
And while I smile back, I never say anything
But inside I'm thinking
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Pussy, pussy walk

And then of course
Now all you men can relate to this
How sometimes you're supposed to go out of the house
And get something done
Like you're supposed to go to the store
And just go get a bottle of milk
Or just go to your job
And do it good and cone back home
But on the way, my God
There's a girl, and there's another girl, and there's another girl

And pretty soon you're surrounded
And your eyes are going one way
And your head is going another way
Ano your nose is going up
And your nose is going down
And you're thinking about that pussy
And it's become a real distraction
And you've gotta ask yourself

Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove

Iggy Pop,"One day as I was walking
Through an airport corridor
I saw a comely goth girl
With tattoos on her form
She gazed up with her pretty white face
And shone her eyes on me
She shined my shoes and then I knew
That I would spellbound be

Her hair was not the shiniest
Her skin was not like silk
But she had a way of looking
That made me want to milk
As I sat high above her
Her cleavage I could see
I contemplated both of them
That's how she spellbound me

She wore black on her clothing
And she wore black on her boots
Lt was Lollapalooza day
But she didn't like he groups
I got lost in her pale skin
And wanted to stay down
But I had someone waiting
So I left spellbound

So if you're dark and lovely
And you see me passing by
A smile I'd appreciate
And a little bit of crime
I haven' got a dollar
And I haven't got a crown
I wander lost across this earth
I'm just spellbound",Shoeshine Girl

Someone broke his wing

To belong here, to belong here, to belong here 
I'm giving up my soul
To belong, to belong, to belong

Gonna catch a fly
The web is pulling tight around him

Iggy Pop,"A little girl trapped in her knowledge and craft
Came tripping to my room last night
I cooked her a steak and I tried not to fake
And still make everything alright
She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares
She tried hard not to let 'em show
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin' up the meat
But doubts fell in my mind like snow
And when the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks
The facade falls down

It's a sunny afternoon and I'm sitting in my robe
I'm dirty and I'm here alone
There's a story on my table that talks about me
And I want to stuff it down the author's throat
And I'm sleeping with someone new every night
And in the morning politely saying ""bye""

And I'm nowhere and no one
And I only wanna run
And I feel like a hamburger bun
And when you must
Believe or bust
The facade falls down
When you're scared of a brand new care
The facade falls down
I got no reason to believe
I got no reason but I'm New York Scumbag Tough
And I'll keep on truckin'

So night is falling
And I'm getting' tired
And it's time to get my slippers and books
Got a sweater and glasses
And something that passes
For a way to get by in this world
And I'm getting' tired
Of so many different things
I guess I'm just plain tired
Or maybe too intelligent to believe
In the obvious side of things
And when voice says make a choice
The facade falls down
When your knees start to concede
The facade falls down
When the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks
The facade falls down

The facade falls down [Repeat: x5]",Facade
Iggy Pop,"She sat on the pavement
As I pulled in the drive
Wearing leopard skin velvet
And shiny black eyes
""She looks like a sleeper""

Said my wife at the time
She had curls like Delilah
And a smile like the sun
She held my poor corpse
Like she'd never be done
And the caption in my mind said
""This is the one""

But I'm strong and I'm disciplined
And I avoided her for years
'Till one night, as usual
With my heart full of tears
A hand touched my back

And she was standing right there
Then I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury
Whispering
Whispering

Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is
How my life was a desert before she came in
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house
The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now
Aah I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her

Well time went by quickly
And her confidence grew
And she wanted this and that
And she wanted those too
And she wouldn't shut up
And one day I just blew up
Now she's in the hospital
For the second time
Maybe she'll die
Maybe I'll cry
Therapists would say
""You're in denial""

But love became inconvenient
Love became a literal drag
Very bad for business
I'd be better off a fag
She's a model de sport
That I can't afford
'Cause I'm a practical American
From the Middle-West
And I can piss on a grave
While welcoming guests
If cold's what I am
I'm cold 'till the end
And I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
Now I'm gonna continue walking
In the modern world
Which justifies every egotistical perversion
With scientific talk
And new ways to walk

But I'll remember the religion
She became to me
And the other person I could have been

But you're old enough to know
That actions form a pattern
And the heart's the last to know
And I'm waitin' for another friend
Callin' long distance again

My mind is an antique room
There's overstuffed chairs and carpets too
Where nobody ever comes
It's a good place to run away from
And I'm runnin' from a love
With every step I take
And if I can fall for you then
From the last one I am saved
And it's a cold grey wet December
Shity shity day
And I'm waitin' for another friend
Calling long distance again

You're dark and your French voice is lovely
And you're bright eyes light the receiver across the miles
I'm listening close and I'm hoping
To learn love, but I don't know how

Iggy Pop,"Her skin is copper and her voice is Spanish red
Her vibe is golden 'till her anger kills it dead
She wants the world to see
A body rich in harmony
A mouth cruel as death

She rides a fantasy she hasn't tested yet
She looks in every mirror to check her silhouette
The turning heads
The honking horns
Gave proof to her
Since she was born
That love is her game

She loves me, Miss Argentina
Though she hides behind her smile
She runs free, Miss Argentina
Dripping blood
With lots of style

She loves to stay in bed and watch the movies play
She wants a husband who will worship and obey
The moods that she enjoys like children's' games and football toys
She laughs without shame

She likes the military and the Rolling Stones
Her little brother has a T-shirt from Ramones
She's shy and sensitive and doesn't know the tougher games
But boy can she love

She's easy, Miss Argentina
A masterpiece without a frame
She runs free, Miss Argentina
But Venus is a dangerous game

She saves my spirit with a humanistic light
She's greedy, lazy and impossible to like
She dresses sexually
And she's afraid of many things
Like being alone

She's back with mother now
She's over twenty-five
I tried to keep her, but she buried me alive
In love and birth and jealousy
And every emotion totally freed
Screaming at once

But she loves me, Miss Argentina
While she hides behind her smile
She runs free, Miss Argentina
Dripping blood with lots of style
She's lovely, Miss Argentina
A masterpiece without a frame
She's easy, Miss Argentina
But Venus is a dangerous game",Miss Argentina
Iggy Pop,"I saw her in a dream but it wasn't true 
Through the smoke and fire 
Of the exhaust fumes 
She just laughed and loved me 'till I was no use 
And I'll never fall in love again 
She's a motorcycle that I can't ride 
She's a precious jewel that I can't buy 
She's a scene I'm playin' in which I die 
And I'll never fall in love again 
""I never play to win"" 
Is what she said 
And poured a little cocaine in my head 
She's a fuckin' Picasso in bed 
And I'll never fall in love again 

Now your voice 
So Spanish and clear 
Rings like a church bell in my ear 
But I don't believe in a word I hear 
And I'll never fall in love again 
My mind calls you in the night 
My mind calls you and I want to take flight 
To some other garden of sweet delight 
And I'll never fall in love again",Motorcycle
Iggy Pop,"I want to fuck her on the floor
Among my books of ancient lore
So I will make a full report
I got a Nazi Girlfriend

It's not her baby-fine blond hair
It's more the desert in her stare
I've got a Nazi Girlfriend

She's not the colt
That she once was
She's elegant
But youth is lost
Still she has ways to make me talk

She wears two crosses

Iggy Pop,"It was in the winter of my fiftieth year
When it hit me
I was really alone
And there wasn't a hell a lot of time left
Every laugh and touch that I could get
Became more important

Strangely, I became more bookish
And my home and study meant more to me
As I considered the circumstances of my death
I wanted to find a balance between joy and dignity

On my way out
Above all, I didn't want to take any more shit
Not from anybody",No Shit
Iggy Pop,"She's gone
I froze her out
Move by move
First I didn't hold her hand
Then I didn't touch her in bed
Then I wasn't tender with her upsets
Then I just told her to go
And still, she didn't go
I had to push.

Now this place is peaceful as a grave
It's dead quiet without her
And her stupid t.v. shows
And young girl laughing

I was always ashamed she read Cosmopolitan
I should have been proud of her
What did she want that was so bad?
She just wanted to believe that someone would
Love her and look after her always
She called me Daddy

With their necks choking tight
In their collars dead white

They're all footballs too.

And trying to score.

Run--kick

As every chump and champ knows.

Till we're worn out inside.

We're kicking each other,
Right where it hurts,

Setting up the big play,
And trying to score.

See'mon! Yeah! hey! all right
You got an ugly ass guy,
He got a problem with his dick.
You got a song with no soul,
Fucking don't mean a thing.
He got an ugly bouzy house,
He got a girlfriend on T.V,

He can't sing for shit.

They're even parked in my space.
You got a song with no soul,
No truth no love.

Because the music sucks,
That's why little kids blow up.

Iggy Pop,"I'm a Very Important Person
I park in the V.I.P
And when I go to the bathroom,
I go in the V.I.P toilet
And when I wanna change a light bulb,
I don't do it myself
I have a technician
Cause I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
Now, as I began to become a V.I.P,
I forgot what I've become a V.I.P for
I began to grow accustomed to people saying
""Right this way sir, drinks are on the house""
Flight attendants on airplanes saying

""Please, really, I don't wanna bother you sir, but it's such a pleasure to have you on board.
May I have your autograph for my daughter?""
""Yeah baby right after I go to the toilet
I I'll give you a couple of 'em
Cause I'm a V.I.P!""

Now,one thing about V.I.P is,is they never seem to be alone
Oh no !
The ""true"" V.I.P must travel with an entourage !
People who say ""Right on boss""
Cause it's a V.I.P!
Right on boss
I'm a V.I.P!
As I began to realize that I had gained V.I.P status,
Worries began to creep in
What if one day,I woke up,and I was no longer a V.I.P?
No more good tables at the restaurants,
No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets,
No more top notch booty
No more entourage to say ""Right boss""
I began to have nightmares
And in my nightmares, I was just a fucking nobody.
Laying at the beach, imagining myself being a VIP!
Just like I was before,
Hearing the applause in my head
Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender

V.I.P
V.I.P

Of course, when one becomes a V.I.P,
One meets other V.I.Ps
At social occasions,
And one inevitably thinks,
""thick! How shallow and crass these people are!
They're not down to earth and real like me,
Oh no! I'm a very special V.I.P""

Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood, 
Is the ""V.I.P reflection effect"", during which anyone associated with the V.I.P, 
Becomes a sort of V.I.P in their own right! Such as ""son OF the V.I.P"",
""Guitar player FOR the V.I.P"",
""Girlfriend WITH the V.I.P"",
""Accountants of the V.I.P""
The maid, the dog, the music publisher, huh!
All enjoy a sort of 'reflected glory', as in

""Hi this is Nastea
I work for Iggy
And I'd like 6 tables tonight in the V.I.P section
And he needs passes for everyone
And free drinks of course
In the V.I.P area""
Right on boss
Cause I'm a V.I.P.
It's also true that when one is a V.I.P, everybody's happy to see you, all the time!
And there's an implicit rule that a V.I.P must never, never
Be on a barn.
Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day
And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood.
They will ""thck!tchk!tchk ! mur mur mur mur mur!"",
And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention:
A ""difficult"" V.I.P.
Psychologists tell us that a sense of self-esteem
Is so necessary in today's world.
As a V.I.P, I can guarantee you, you'll never be alone.
You'll never be alone.
Cause you're a V.I.P!",V.I.P.

Every night is a hee-hawing mule when there's blood on your cool

Cruelty will be your school when there's blood on your cool

Beast has a world for please
A world of cruelty
Doesn't do shit for free

Soul leaves but I'm not mad
Oh, fuck it, yes I am
It's either me or them

Not working how 'bout you?
Don't even fight the weather

Quick fading live of lies

Might be a crown but still
I might get a fucking bill

Kills all infatuation

You cannot get in college
Would you like Cain or Abel

They called him Thunder 'cause he had the spark
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure

Look away Look away

They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots
They live the dream and they went non-stop
They did' ok 'til the band broke up

Look away Look away Look away Look away

Unfortunately the needle broke
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone
She was sellin something that I was on

Look away Look away

Now Thunder and me did not part friends
What we did once I wouldn't do again
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon 
'Til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon

Look away Look away

So a few years later Thunder died broke
Sable had a baby back at her folks
Me I went straight and serious too
There wasn't much else that I could do

Look away Look away

So now that I'm straight I'm settled too

I played tag in the auto graveyard
I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate
While they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, a huh
Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called ""Drive the wheel""
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha
Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win
And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street
Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky

Iggy Pop,"She sat on the pavement
As I pulled in the drive
Wearing leopard skin velvet
And shiny black eyes
""She looks like a sleeper""
Said my wife at the time
She had curls like Delilah
And a smile like the sun
She held my poor corpse
Like she'd never be done
And the caption in my mind said
""This is the one""
But I'm strong and I'm disciplined
And I avoided her for years
'Till one night, as usual
With my heart full of tears
A hand touched my back
And she was standing right there
Then I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury
Whispering
Whispering

Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is
How my life was a desert before she came in
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house
The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now
Aah I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her

Well time went by quickly
And her confidence grew
And she wanted this and that
And she wanted those too
And she wouldn't shut up
And one day I just blew up
Now she's in the hospital
For the second time
Maybe she'll die
Maybe I'll cry
Therapists would say
""You're in denial""
But love became inconvenient
Love became a literal drag
Very bad for business
I'd be better off a fag
She's a model de sport
That I can't afford
'Cause I'm a practical American
From the Middle-West
And I can piss on a grave
While welcoming guests
If cold's what I am
I'm cold 'till the end
And I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
Now I'm gonna continue walking
In the modern world
Which justifies every egotistical perversion
With scientific talk
And new ways to walk
But I'll remember the religion
She became to me
And the other person I could have been
So for now I'll say so long
I gotta go do wrong
I gotta go do wrong

Once I found out they never dared
To seize the world and shake it upside down

Till all the plates are broken
Cry for love
Until my eyes are soakin'
Yeah cry for love
On every salmon morning
Cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Bad TV that insults me freely
Still I know what I'm dyin' to see
In searching for a meaningful embrace
Sometimes my self-respect took second place

An' I cried for love
I did what my heart told me
Cried for love
Can't stand it
When they scold me
Yeah I cried for love
On every salmon morning
Yeah I cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Surfers ride for love and wipe out when it hits 'em
Soldiers kill for love and nobody admits it
If you're cryin' for love well, that's ok don't sweat it
If you're cryin' for love then there's still a chance you'll get it

Iggy Pop,"Winners and losers which one am I,
Is it the same under the sky?
Black motorcycles and the will to survive
Losers and winners low and high
In this glass and wire world
Surely leeches gain the right
To send their message screaming
One that has no meaning
To people who feel

questions and questions plain as your nose
But who would believe a little rose?
Winners and losers in love with themselves
No santa claus no happy elves
In this smoking gun existence
It gets harder to unwind
I'll just eat my breakfast
Try to keep my questions
Starving all night

out in the suburbs I met
My true fine love
Down in the suburbs I met
My true fine love
She gave me money
She gave me head
She gave my everything
And then she went dead

stick out your thumb
And hit the open road
Cat in a mercedes
Goes by, he's old
He's got some, you got none
Together maybe you can have
Some fun-winners and losers
Gentlemen boozers
Winners and losers

roll roll roll roll
Roll your money down
Rock rock rock rock
Takln' over this town

Iggy Pop,"I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon, her
Young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

I am gonna love her till the end
I am gonna love her till the end
I will love her till I die
I will see her in the sky

Iggy Pop,"See a black El Dorado
Oh, rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ! She's beautiful
You know how soft she is
Just what you feel like

Oh, I'm so far away from her
Jesus this is Iggy
You, you might as well come with me,
When you ride the ride
There's talk and I don't wanna talk

Can't you see, oh no, Stepping on our hearts

How come the blacks, how come they, they copy you so good?
They get off on you, so sexually?
If you wanna make it
Young man you gotta make somebody come
Come out of your black
Come out of your black
Black and strong and black black and strong and
Black! Strong! Black!

Jesus it's cold in this room, it's really cold
You know I never, I never told you about this, but there's one guy
Somebody I really love, he's never around
Well he was taking things that could be alright, that could be nice
And make him so ugly, so damn ugly
And we put out the lights on them
Yeah, we'd make it dark, we put out the lights, on them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Come down and dance with me, dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Oh accept me, don't reject me, don't forget me

Iggy Pop,"Uh
I played tag in the auto graveyard
I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate
While they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, a huh
Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called ""Drive the wheel""
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha

Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win

And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street

Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky

Cold metal, got to be
Skeleton of the free
Cold metal, it's gotta be
Better save a tree

Save a tree, save a tree, save a tree, save a tree
Yeah",Cold Metal [DVD]
Iggy Pop,"A howling wind is whistling in the night
My dog is growling in the dark
Something's pulling me outside
To ride around in circles
I know that you have got the time
'Cause anything I want, you do
You'll take a ride through the strangers
Who don't understand how to feel
In the deathcar, we're alive
In the deathcar, we're alive

I'll let some air come in the window
Kind of wakes me up a little
I don't turn on the radio
'Cause they play shit, like
You know
When your hand was down on my dick
It felt quite amazing
And now that, that is all over
All we've got is the silence
In the deathcar, we're alive
In the deathcar, we're alive
So come on mandolins, play

When I touched you
I felt that you still had your baby fat
And a little taste of baby's breath
Makes me forget about death
At your age you're still joking
It ain't time yet for the choking
So now we can see the movie and see each other truly
In the deathcar, we're alive
In the deathcar, we're alive
I want to hear some mandolins",In the Death Car
Iggy Pop,"How insensitive I must have seemed
When you told me that you loved me
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When you told me so sincerely

Why you might have asked
Did I just turn and stare away in icy silence?
What was I to do?
What can you do when a love affair is over?

Now I'm alone
And I see all the heartache in your last look
Vague and drawn and sad I see it still
All the memory of that last look

Why you might have asked
Did I just turn and went in icy silence?
What was I to do?
What can you do when a love affair is over?",How Insensitive
Iggy Pop,"I wanna go to the beach
I don't care if it's decadent
I don't know where my spirit went
But that's alright

I wanna go to the deep
Cause there's nowhere I want to be
And nobody I want to see
But that's alright

Particles of pain in my brain
I guess they're here to stay
They work their way inside
And I can't hide or even walk away

You can convince the world
That you're some kind of superstar
When an asshole is what you are
But that's alright

Waiting, hating the shit life throws my way
Hating, waiting to make my escape

I wanna go to the beach",I Want to Go to the Beach

I got a dirty nose
I don't want no shoes
I don't want no clothes

I'm living like the king of the dogs
I got a piece of meat
In between my teeth
I will bite your throat
If you move on me

I am sovereign
I'm the king of the dogs

Polite life will fill you full of cancer

Iggy Pop,"Two weeks after my arrival Fox died just after sunset
I was stretched out on the bed when he approached
And tried painfully to jump up he wagged his tail nervously
Since the beginning he hadn't touched his bowl once
He had lost a lot of weight

I helped him to settle on my lap
For a few seconds he looked at me
With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology
Then, calmed, he closed his eyes
Two minutes later he gave out his last breath

I buried him beside the residence
At the western extremity of the land
Surrounded by the protective fence
Next to his predecessors

During the night a rapid transport
From the Central City dropped off an identical dog
They knew the codes and how to work the barrier
I didn't have to get up to greet them

A small white and ginger mongrel
Came toward me wagging its tail
I gestured to him
He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me

Love is simple to define
But it seldom happens in the series of beings
Through these dogs we pay homage to love
And to its possibility

What is a dog but a machine for loving
You introduce him to a human being giving him the mission to love
And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid this human being might be
The dog loves him, the dog loves him",A Machine for Loving
Iggy Pop,"It's party time and I smell slime
You stupid people make me evil

Dicks and asses, cocktail glasses
Parlor games, exchange of fluids

Cause it's party time, it's party time
It's party time, I got the slime

Here's a brute, isn't he cute?
He needs a hole to bury his soul in

Cause it's party time, it's party time
It's party time, I got the slime, I got the slime",Party Time
Iggy Pop,"Et si tu n’existais pas,
Dis-moi pourquoi j’existerais?
Pour traîner dans un monde sans toi,
Sans espoir et sans regrets.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
J’essaierais d’inventer l’amour,
Comme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts
Naître les couleurs du jour.
Et qui n’en revient pas.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Dis-moi pour qui j’existerais?
Des passantes endormies dans mes bras
Que je n’aimerais jamais.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Je ne serais qu’un point de plus
Dans ce monde qui vient et qui va,
Je me sentirais perdu,
J’aurais besoin de toi.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Dis-moi comment j’existerais?
Je pourrais faire semblant d’être moi,
Mais je ne serais pas vrai.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Je crois que je l’aurais trouvé,
Le secret de la vie, le pourquoi,
Simplement pour te créer
Et pour te regarder.",Et Si Tu N'existais Pas
Iggy Pop,"Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
People stopping staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Backing off of the North East winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Oh

Iggy Pop,"I'm going away smiling, thinking of our life
How we were good for each other, how we knew
When I came to you, I was all black and blue
You just smiled and said, your love was true
We had a great time, didn't we?
Never knew this is how it would be

私は微笑みながら去る
私たちの人生を思い出しながら
私たちの素敵な縁をいつくしみながら
あなたに出会ったとき、私はぼろぼろだった
あなたは微笑んで、真実の愛を誓った
なんて素晴らしい時を一緒に過ごしたのだろう
こんな終わりを誰が想像しただろう

Now the boat is slowly leaving, leaving the life I loved
I see you standing at the pier, trying to hide your fear
Thank you for the memories, thank you for the laughs
I'm going away, this time,
Remember no tears

静かに船は出て行く、私の愛した人生の港から
波止場にたたずむあなたの不安を押し殺した顔が見える

一緒に笑った時間を、ありがとう

Iggy Pop,"Each place I go only the lonely go
Some little small cafe
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be

The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care

And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be the one time
A hopeless little dream like that comes true

If you find love hang on to each caress
And never let love go
For when it's gone you'll know the loneliness
The heartbreak only the lonely know",Only the Lonely
Iggy Pop,"Je veux dédier ce poème
A toutes les femmes qu'on aime
Pendant quelques instants secrets
A celles qu'on connaît à peine
Qu'un destin différent entraîne
Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais

A celle qu'on voit apparaître
Une seconde à sa fenêtre
Et qui, preste, s'évanouit
Mais dont la svelte silhouette
Est si gracieuse et fluette
Qu'on en demeure épanoui

A la compagne de voyage
Dont les yeux, charmant paysage
Font paraître court le chemin
Qu'on est seul, peut-être, à comprendre
Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre
Sans avoir effleuré sa main

A la fine et souple valseuse
Qui vous sembla triste et nerveuse
Par une nuit de carnaval
Qui voulu rester inconnue
Et qui n'est jamais revenue
Tournoyer dans un autre bal

A celles qui sont déjà prises
Et qui, vivant des heures grises
Près d'un être trop différent
Vous ont, inutile folie,
Laissé voir la mélancolie
D'un avenir désespérant

Chères images aperçues
Espérances d'un jour déçues
Vous serez dans l'oubli demain
Pour peu que le bonheur survienne
Il est rare qu'on se souvienne
Des épisodes du chemin

Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie
On songe avec un peu d'envie
A tous ces bonheurs entrevus
Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre
Aux curs qui doivent vous attendre
Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus

Alors, aux soirs de lassitude
Tout en peuplant sa solitude
Des fantômes du souvenir
On pleure les lèvres absentes
De toutes ces belles passantes
Que l'on n'a pas su retenir",Les Passantes

Au sommet du Fuji-Yama.

Love flew out again

In this city

Close those doors
Close those doors now
Now, now, just keep em open
Keep em open
Yea, keep em open
I'll keep on, keep keep on going
Taking it in so, so heavy
Take it easy son, this ain't so deadly
Got keep on, gotta go on, gotta go on
Take it all with what we've done
Gotta push it push it push it
To the top of the building
Even when no one is feeling
It might bother you
Don't let it
If these people just don't get it
They can't express it
They won't accept it
She said it's okay that they may never give you that credit.

[Chorus: x2]

I've been down here
Down these roads
People pass through
Some stay some go
Standing here broke
Not a penny to my name
But she says she loves me all the same
I try my best
And you do to
And all you want is something you can move to
Everybody's gotta get their kicks somewhere
Everybody gotta fit in somewhere
There's, an open road
And I'm traveling down
Don't know where to go
But I lock and load
Shoot that sky till the moon explode
Moon explode
Now we're laying in a field
White flowers on our backs
Talking bout home
But we can't go back
I guess that's why we left
So we could take a step
Keep moving and forget the rest.

You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself
You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself

[Chorus: x2]

And I found that round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear

Iglu & Hartly,"She kept on walking and she never ever looked back
And you do know everybody in town knew that
She gonna take off, going to be a star
When there's nothing left she gonna jump out of your car

This is a little limerick
Of something that don't exist
Called love and the passion
They're coming together with action
I'm never hesitating with my words or my thoughts
I go on
Blasting through these doors
Just to show them what I got
I, got my hand motion into the sky
You got your, hands grabbing onto another lie
Now take it easy baby
You never forget where you're from
Swallow your pride
'cause everyone thinks they is number one
Some, people can love
Some people can only hate
Some people are deviant in the back of the face
It would take all the strength
Of an army loaded with guns
And all that it takes
Is an army of one

Now what you're telling me is this
Let me get it correct
'cause I'm a step up in this motherfucker
Dripping with sweat
I know a glimpse is better
Than never seeing at all
At least I know what to expect when all the leaves start to fall

She kept on walking and she never ever looked back
And you do know everybody in town knew that
She gonna take off, going to be a star
When there's nothing left she gonna jump out of your car

This is the motion of the ocean
And it's overflowing
This is the motion of the ocean
And it's overflowing
I gotta keep it up
Keep on going
Don't stop exposing myself
Out to the public
Got to make em love it
Gotta, make em hurdle over people to see
Me and my shiny gold hair
And my shiny white teeth
Eventually enchanted with their newly crowned king
They follow me with pictures of myself
They just ripped out the magazine
No time for autographs
I got places to be
Gotta race around the world
Until there's nothing to see
Like a helicopter
Spinning rotors floating in the sky
Your free girl
Go on and go on and give it a try.

I see your asking what I got with a pocket full of holes
And we're the exact opposite
But we keep blowing smoke
So now tell me why you insist
On wasting my fucking time
Keep on searching round here for something you ain't gunna find
So lets take a step back
Remove our mask and ask
Is this the way we're gonna live
Keep on stepping over cracks
I know you try so hard to be what you want to be
But it ain't that
So I'm a say c'mon baby, go on a lay back.

Pulled down from the midnight sky
And it ain't gunna be like you thought it was
But it, could be like you make it now,
Shoulda please
Take a step back for me
What the hell did you come all the way down to be'
I know you don't see it
But I do
So keep on moving and I'll walk with you
And we can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
We can zipcord across the sky

Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me

Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young'

Hold me back
I think I'm bout to blow
Hit me here, then you know
It's not a question about getting the message
It's been a while since you been so progressive
Lets, keep it in the crowd, amongst ourselves
We the only mofuckas getting it and no one else
So lets take the train
Drive really far away
We ain't never gunna stop
We ain't never gunna stay
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me

I waved goodbye to a place where everybody knew my name
Left my blue-eyed girl
Starring out the window
In the rain
Told her when I met her
That I had to hit the road
Now I wish I never met her
Cause I cannot let her go
Hearts break
But that's alright with me
Cause I only left room so I could ride with three
And we're taking a trip
We ain't turning around
So please don't try to bring me down

We got bottles to hold
Our motto is gold
Never back down
This ain't easy so
Get a nice grip
And hold on for the ride
If you can't take it
Better jump for your life
And watch out and be ready to hurdle
We got sharks around
And they're starting to circle
All around my feet
They're biting on my shoes
It's a little knick-knack
And it all comes back

Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just sit around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just run around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

Forget the clock on the wall
Forget about it all
Live like time don't exist
It's a small
Thing to do to change the way we act
I look around the corner life is changing fast
But it really don't have to be like that do it
I don't wanna go and leave you
Going back through it
But I'm driving away in a car full of friends
Hearing songs that remind of the time that we spend, and
Now I'm sitting and I'm wondering if
The thunders gonna roll when we kiss, or
Is the rain gonna come down
Gotta go inside so we can talk some more.

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just sit around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

Or we can just run around, and do whatever we like

A phone calls sticking in the back of my mind
I was listening to you
Yea it's been a long time
And it might have been a hard year
It ain't easy when you're looking in the mirror
Only seeing your tears
Enough is enough
And all this time
Spent just drinking it up out of my mind
Counting the times
We would have a lot of fun
Get into a little trouble
Hoping fences on the run
And, we can only look in the past so long
Give us a second
We can sing a song
About all the happy times
And the times we got mad
Fighting, giving up and smiling before we shook hands
Now, I got one thing to say
Take a seat next to me and stay
A while
We can cross paths again
Like we did
Before we grew up and did our own shit, shit.

Please don't forget
Please don't forget
'cause these moments they seem to fade so quick
We put aside just a little time to laugh
Got places to go, so little time for that, but
When we go our separate ways
Remember the days
Late night, staying up, sharing a blaze
'cause these times, those times
All those low times
We've been together, gonna be better in no time
'cause everything that happens is a blessing in disguise
We can read it like a bunch of letters in the sky
What it says, who knows but I know
We gotta a lot to talk about
So come on lets go

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just sit around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just run around, and do whatever we like

Igor Bril,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die.

Now if you feel me, just let me know
Put your hands way up in the air, and holler ""Ho!""
It's new breed of female kickin' the Northcoast flavor
Rhymes that'll fade ya
Listen close to save ya
Well it's the new era
Now, check my Northcoast side
Everybody hollerin' ""Cleveland"" all of a sudden now
Down with the Northcoast, they said from the beginnin'
Even though I know they just caught on, see I done ?
Bumpin' comin' from downtown on my way to the Clair
Northcoast playas steadily puttin' it in the air

[Brina]
Clair's makin' paper
Cleveland bum rushin' the industry's map
Door's sittin' wide open for us trues
Comin' through with the Mo Thug camp
Many skills'll get ya hands in the air, bobbin' your head
Guaranteed to split that wig up
Females makin' moves from the Land
Puttin' it down for the radio
Northcoast comin' up
A sista done told you exactly what's 'bout to go down
Two trues, they takin' over

[Hook: Jhaz]
Now if you feel me, just let me know

[Brina]
We all about flexin' styles
it's a twenty-four seven rap vibe
Northcoast, follow me on this journey
I'll make it a hell ride
For your, bump II Tru all you want, your CD changin'
Roll through the hood, get smokin', livin' it up
In the streets, they play us
Mistake us for bein' soft on the physical, but I still throw blows
Females respected
Whatyou expect comin' from the Northcoast? 

[Jhaz]
You see we roll gold ones, flex with big diamonds
St. Clair, Cleveland on the map
That's how find us - blazin'
Steadily comin' up with new tracks
Even the haters be bobbin'
Talkin' this just 'cause they beats phat
Expert females with the beams
So listen close: this is how we be kickin' it
Come on up to the Northcoast

[Brina]
In Cleveland, see the ""Heart of It All"" known to be off the hook
Nightclubs showin' trues much love - every night get booked
Parlay all through Ohio
Roll deep with the Mo Thug family - nothin' but representers
Makin' it known up in this industry
Feel me, tape sales on the rise
And nationwide support for the North
Competition gettin' nothin'
Better withdraw yourself from this sport

Are you ready?
'Cause we're ready

(Hook)

[haz]
Now we can smoke blunts with Optimos or Swishers
It don't matter
A little Hennessy, bet not step to me, 'cause I be badder
And I gets madder when punks choose
Out of all the many Mo Thugs, they want to test us trues
But see they still lose, take you for whatever you want
We got the pump for your trunk, so ain't no doubtin' us pros

[Brina]
Beatin' you down in the Northcoast, dog
Brina puttin' it down, comin' from the Land
Styles to make a fortune
Got you wide open
Feel this clan of intelligent ballers
Can't stop us from clockin' them dollars
'Cause we can create some of them scripts
That'll make you realize who got the power
Up in this rap game, Cleveland rippin' these charts to pieces
Any doubt in your mind, competition ain't ready for the female sistas

[Jhaz]
And we givin' out shots to all the hoods in the Land, even suburbs
They caught you trippin', but we ain't shady, man
And you know, all of St. Clair got love
'Cause that's where all of my peoples choose to thug
And, yeah, I be braggin', but Jhaz tend to boast
But a sista put it down in the Land for the Northcoast

Are you ready?

[Brina]
Nigga, first thing in morning 'fore I even get up
I gots to start off my day to a fat-ass blunt
Step out the house on the get-high-creep
'Cause when I'm good and fucked-up
I'm a smash some peeps, and ain't nothin'
Like smokin' when you're a fool
Find the next, get a hot spot, jump in it 'til ya pull
Ridin' on the Clair, 'cause over there they can smoke it
And while I'm on the topic
Here's a shot to all that know me

(Hook)
[Krayzie]
Smoke, smoke, smoke
Smoke up the whole thing, better believe it
That's how we get weeded, so nigga
Quit tryin' to budget your but
'Cause it's a whole lot of thugs and niggas gettin' high
So don't go smoke a blunt, and you got a ounce in the ride
Nigga, come off that reefer, 'cause I go broke everytime
Indo slow blowin' my mind
Still I proceed to hit that shit - it's wicked, sticky
Smoke one with your thugsta, thugsta
And show me you can smoke with the thugs
Because I'm gonna get you high
If you want to get higher, come ride
I will fly you

[Jhaz]
? puff, 'cause really it ain't ?
Ain't wastin' no herb by lettin' it burn, let me hit that sticky
Nothin' but the Moet in my cup, the sticky packed in the blunt
My cap is too thick, so I'm constantly blazin' another blunt up
We smokes all day, when the sticky runs out
Gotta roll to the hood for a stress sack
Gotta get that blaze on still, gotta keep them wig-splittin' back
Bump these hardest tracks, rappin' on the album of the century
They the thugs that got it before these trues make moves
And history, strictly on a mission to have a good time
Freestyles and rhymes, smoke dimes
Shots out to any true that gotta bag of this here, now

[Layzie]
Oh, how I love my green leaves, nigga
Givin' nothin' but respect, and I really ain't picky
I fuck with the stress, but I got four-fifty on the best weed
Tonight, we gettin' higher than high, let's all get lifted
P.O.D.'ded and tweeded, that indo needs to be seedless
So you know I'm fiendin', now am I wrong for smokin' this on 'til the dawn?
? in infamy done brought me back the bomb, and it's on
So what I'm a do is I'm a twist it up and hit the sticky for you
Smoke and choke with II Tru - they keepin' it platinum
Makin' it happen for the Land, smokin' and movin' as we speak
Tryin' to teach the world to be a thug in harmony
Nigga, we keepin' the bomb-ass weed
Blaze it up, nigga, what?
Mo Thugs is 'bout the music and bud, equal love

[Jhaz]
Can I blaze, man?
Pass me the Swisha, Optimo, Philly Blunt, or the House of Windsor
Twist ya head back, snap, crack, inhale the smoke
Then, pass it to the left, so the next man can toke
Loc, homie, I'm cool on that water
Just bring that sticky and this drink, do me fine, playa partner
Miss bitch the shit, 'cause you can't smoke for free
And naw, smokin' weed don't make a sister horny
Ignore the silly ones
Keep on thuggin' for life
Place the lighter to my blunt, 'cause it's time to get high

[Krayzie]
Call up my family, let 'em know the reason I blow
Celebration, we done slapped the platinum back at you hoes
So, you know it's on (it's on)
So, how my niggas had to show me, homie
I'm fucked-up 'til the morning sunlight
Lick and twist another Swisha soon as I get up
And then right after breakfast puff another
Fucked-up
Wonder if it's good for my health
'Cause ain't known a muthafucka that done O.D.'d on weed yet
So, bring your blunts and some Hen and some herb
My nigga, fuck what ya heard
My Mo Thug niggas splurge

[Brina]
Better learn to ? mo, much love
Got thousands from Cleveland to Cali
That's how we roll, follow 'em
Once humongous blow up even more, when we crash the show
We shuts 'em down underground, clown from town to town
Bring a box of fifty House of Windsors
We about to blaze this pound of the real sticky
Bum rush in my lungs with a cloud of smoke, puff 'em
'Bout ready to exhale before me mind blow
E-Z Wider, Swisha, or Philly, don't matter really
'Cause it smoke the same
You know the procedure: two hits, then pass to the left when we blazin'

IIIrd Tyme Out,"Brother, as along life's way you go 
And you're burdened being below 
And your steps are growing slow beneath the load 
Let your saviour lend you a helping hand 
All you need to understand 
As you travel down this lonesome, long lonesome road. 


(Chorus) 
It's a lonesome road through this world of care 
As you travel long, seem to get nowhere 
Ask the blessed Lord to bear your heavy load 
He'll guide you on this lonesome, long lonesome road. 


When your dear friends have turned you down 
And the whole world seems to frown 
And old Satan tries to steal your crown with his code 
Trust in Jesus and I'm sure you'll find 
Him a leader, true and kind 
As you travel down this lonesome, long lonesome road. 
",It's a Lonesome Road
IIIrd Tyme Out,"You were my heart’s desire you set the flame of love on fire
No other love could take the place of you
Then you left me all alone so lonely and so blue
I found someone to take your place, what was I supposed to do?

Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come?
Or cry and plead down on my knees for you
I couldn't stand to be alone you left me nothing else to choose
I found someone to take your place, what was I supposed to do?

I know I vowed there'd never be another love ever for me
The dream I was searching for was you
When my dream came to an end there was no use to pretend
I found someone to take your place, what was I supposed to do?

Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come?
Or cry and plead down on my knees for you
I couldn't stand to be alone you left me nothing else to choose
I found someone to take your place, what was I supposed to do?",What Was I Supposed to Do?
IIIrd Tyme Out,"There's a deep silent river flowin' just beyond
And its waters are deep and wide
It's as dark as the night but my eyes see a light
Just down by the riverside

Chorus:
There's a light at the river 
A light at the river a light at the river I can see
My Lord will stand and hold in his hand a light at the river for me

To this deep silent river I have come on my knees 
I'm afraid for I know I've sinned
But the beckoning light leads me on through the night
To the waters where my soul may be cleansed

Repeat chorus 

I can hear His voice saying come unto me 
Dip your wings in the misty tide
Then we'll pass o'er deep and you'll never more weep
In your home on the other side 

Repeat chorus ",Light at the River
iiO,"I'd wake up, and make love to you if i had you
I would touch you so much, but I'm not allowed to
What I hate is to wait, but in this case I'm patient
I'm discreet, I'm not weak, I just need the moment

He wants me, he wants me not
I want everything he's got
If I leaned over and tried to kiss you
Would I be wrong, after so long to kiss you

Would you pretend, we're only friends, if I kissed you
At least I can dream of you in a scene, when I'd kiss you
On one hand, we are friends, but still my mind wanders
Through side streets and alleys, I just keep growing fonder

To stop me is not easy, can't stop a lion from hunting
I'm focused, I won't miss, there's no control of some things",Kiss You

And I've landed on the
Password
Am I paralyzed?
Cause I need you ever after
All the questioning
You are every single answer
I was shivering
You're the fireplace in winter
What I would not give to have
Here with me is all I ask
Be it as it may
You are every night
And every day

iiO,"Sweet little chaste woman
Why are you holding your breath in an ocean
Where the abyss is infinitely deep
Skiing mountains dangerously steep

Collecting all the dainty roses
Envisioning the one who proposes
I pray your garden's always filled with seeds
That it's not bothered by the stem of the weed

You keep your jewels in a safe
And only one set of keys
Careful to only bestow
The one who gets on his knees

Don't believe in what is wrong, keep your night light on
You're confusing lust for love
Learn it will be gone
Don't believe in what is wrong

Keep your eyes open
You thought love and lust were one...
No! They're so different
Only love remains

Lust is all a game
Once you learn the truth
All will come to you

The point I'm making is the one you're missing
I'm only telling you so that you don't have to
Make the decisions that I once had to
I'm not a preacher who has practiced

I'm not a teacher but you are still an apprentice
My only fault is that I see this view
You're not guilty, you're beyond your youth
If you're not prepared for this ride

I say you should close your eyes
These fields of no innocence
You couldn't bare this blackened side

In a city where the walls are filled with sound
Basting off the floors
Listening to your own thumping in the bass

The wizards play sirens
People march, some chant with the sound
A lot of the tourists are smaller then their shell
Funny they forget how small they really are in that grand city
Some even forget where they came from

The gatekeepers, they don't own the key
They're merely robots that depending on how they feel on that day
Extend their arms to remove and replace
The rope that let's the quest in and out

Oh Israel don't you judge condemn another man
Only yesterday while I was a child

Funny how love can change a man

Unto all tribe I'm still the Levi

While in my spiritual searching

And I write to what is found
I tongue is like a pen of a ready writer
I only speak of things
Pertaining to my Jah and Kings
And of the life of Him
Of whom all things and I dwell and live in

He said blessed are the pure in spirit

For theirs is the Kingdom of Zion
The dwelling of my Father's pavillions
Blessed are they that mourn
RASTAFARI
For they shall be comforted
Within the devineness of my Father's hands
Blessed are the meek
For they shall inherite the earth
And possess the heathen under their humble feet
Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness
For they shall be filled with such spiritual blessing
I am I am I am I am what thou sayest that I am
That is what I am


Blessed is the man that walketh
Not in the council of the ungodly
Nor standeth in the ways of sinners
Nor sitteth in the seats of the scornful
WHAT I AM
But his delight is in the Lord
IS WHAT I AM
God Jah Rastafari
And in his law do I am Serfie Selassie

Jah is love let Him be love

Zion Hut Chapter 2

I often sit alone within my wildertones
Watching my father designings
Whithin the lights on the clouds
Exploring I gloriest heavens
Within Jah signs in my silence
Receiving my Fathers blessings within His own times
I acknownledge all things only unto Him
For His given power I find I'm solid bound
Day unto day utter speeches in many places
While nights unto nights showeth He I His knowledge
For the goodness of myself in whom I'm all well paid
I am I am I am
What thou seest that I am
That is what I am What I am
Jah is love Oh love let Him be love
Jah is love Oh love let Him be love


He said blesses are the merciful
For they shall obtain mercy
And be the saints for everlasting
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they shall see Jah
In earth as it is Mount Zion
Blessed are the peace makers
For they shall be called
The children of the most high God
Jah Rastafari
Blessed are they which persecute
For righteousness' sake
For theirs is the Kingdom of Mount Zion


Zion Hut Chapter 3

And he shall be like tree
Planted by the river of waters
That bringeth forth his fruit in his season
His leaves also shall not wither
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
But the ungodly are not so
But are like the chaff which words driveth away


Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgement
Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the Lord most high God Jah Rastafari
Knoweth the ways of the righteous
But the ways of the ungodly shall perish
Jah
I am I am I am I am what I am I am I am I am Jah is love Jaah is love
The earth is the Lord and the fullness
Let him be love Oh love
In the beginning was the words


BLESSED
For they shall see Jah
In earth as it is in Mount Zion


Blessed are he peace makers
Jah is life Jah is life
For they shall be called
Let him be love
The children of the most high God
Oh love Oh love

Blessed are they which persecute

For Righteousness' sake

On his merry, merry road


In Zion the law giver
The fruits of all roots in Judah
I haile I hymn King of Kings


He said blessed are the pure in spirit
RASTAFARI
For their's is the Kingdom of Zion
The dwelling of my Father pavillions
Blessed are they that mourns
RASTAFARI
For they shall be comforted
Within the devineness of my Father hands
Blessed are the meek
RASTAFARI
For they shall inherit the earth
And possess the Heathen under their humble feet
Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness
For they shall be filled with such spiritual blessing

With these lots of word for each and everyone

Still a chance speak louder than words
To all players of instruments
That only for desire the talent is given
Responsability we must carry
Help those who cannot help themselves
To build in solid foundation

On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.

We've danced the whole night through

Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

Ike & Tina Turner,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe

One of these days you're going to reach eighteen
And all the boys ya see is gonna call ya a queen
You'll smile, and blush, and hold your head up high
But the same little boys will make you cry
So the best thing to do when you reach this age
Is to be a good girl, remember what I say

You make 'em wait, and pick your dates
Woah oh make 'em wait, pick your dates
Before you make a big mistake

You know when true love comes your way
There won't be much that you will say
He'll walk right up and take you by your hand
And he'll lead you right straight to the preacher man
So the best thing to do when you reach this age
Is to be a good girl, remember what I say

You make 'em wait, and pick your dates
Woah oh make 'em wait, pick your dates
Before you make a big mistake

Just because they treat you nice
Doesn't mean they want a wife
Take your time, pick your friends
True to love never ends
Though the dog will have his way
In the end you will say
Remember your old father's words
Don't you be no fool now girl

Ike & Tina Turner,"Born in Louisiana in a town called Franklin
I was fully matured by the time I reached the age of ten
A mulatto girl is what they called me
And us mulattos had no trouble at all with men
All men say that I'm as sweet as honey
'Cause I'm thirty-four, thirty-eight and twenty-two at the tummy

They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet-y is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red

Tried to live a life I thought I wanted me to
I went to church, finished school, was a member of a [?]
But old pastor [?] and Nathan Jones
They were just too hard headed to leave me alone
They said that I was sweet as honey
'Cause I'm thirty-four, thirty-eight and twenty-two at the tummy

They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet Rhode Island Red
Sweet Rhode Island Red

Sweet-y is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red

I was seventeen when I moved to New Orleans
'Cause living in the city has always been my dream
People laughed, said it was a shame and a pity
When old mayor Daley gave me the key to the city
He too said that I was as sweet as honey

You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough

Then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

Working for the man every night and day

Ike & Tina Turner,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe
Ike & Tina Turner,"Samson and Delilah they made it known that a man is weak
For a woman's thrown use your power like Delilah
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.
You know god made man all muscles and strength
But what he gave to woman no man can resist
Use your power like Delilah even Samson couldn't deny
Delilah's power yeah I'm talking about.

Delilah's power I said Delilah's power
Delilah's power Delilah's power use your powers like Delilah.

Soothes his soul use your powers like Delilah

Think you can do without a woman well I don't think you can.

From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Ike Quebec,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

",I Better Get Steppin'
Ike Turner,"Why' know, every now and then 
I think you might like to hear something from us 
Nice and easy 
But there's just one thing 
You see we never ever do nothing 
Nice and easy 
We always do it nice and rough 
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song 
And do it easy 
Then we're gonna do the finish rough 
This is the way we do ""Proud Mary"" 

And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river 
Listen to the story 

I left a good job in the city 
Working for the man every night and day 
And I never lost one minute of sleeping 
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis 
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans 
But I never saw the good side of the city 
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

If you come down to the river 
I bet you gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry if you got no money 
People on the river are happy to give",Proud Mary [Encore]

If I think I'm better of this way

Close the door return wherever you once came

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I kept my promise

I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Yo jure mil veces
No vuelvo a insistir
Pero si un mirar
Me hiere al pasar
Su boca de fuego
Otra vez quiero besar

Basta de carrera
Se acabo la timba
Un final reñido
Yo no vuelvo a ver
Pero si algún pingo
Llega a ser fija el domingo
Yo me juego entero
Qué le voy a hacer

Por una cabeza (por una cabeza)
Todas las locuras (todas las locuras)
Su boca que besa (su boca que besa)
Borra la tristeza
Calma la amargura (por una cabeza)
Por una cabeza (si ella me olvida)
Si ella me olvida (todas las locuras)
Que importa perderme (por una cabeza)
Mil veces la vida
¿Para qué vivir?

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

C'est pourtant bien grâce à lui si je chante aujourd'hui
Je collectionnais ses photos quand j'étais petit
J'avais tout ses disques, je l'imitais devant ma glace
Et si c'est vraiment lui, c'est dégueulasse

Je n'ose pas lui dire bonjour

Lui mentir qu'on n'oublie pas vraiment les gens
Qui ont su si bien nous chanter l'amour

Je n'ose pas lui dire bonjour

Et si j'ai peur, c'est de trop lui ressembler
Et de me retrouver demain

De jolies chanteuses et des idoles plus sympathiques
Il n'a pas su s'adapter aux guitares électriques
Et il n'a jamais compris que c'était fini

Y a quelques histoires sur lui qui font rire le métier
Mais y a pas un seul coco pour vouloir l'engager

Fuggire da Varese sbadigliando aperitivi
Scappare da Caserta a gambe levate
Andare a quel paese dall’altro capo del mondo dove il cielo non finisce mai
Dove l’oceano in tempesta è così bello, che fa paura guardarti neglio occhi
E dirti che ti amo ancora, forse più di prima, amica mia
Scappiamo via da un paese che non cambia, perché non vuole cambiare
Non cambia perché non vuole

Non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia
Non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia

Potrebbe andare peggio
Che ne so io
Potrebbe piovere

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold",Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad
Il Volo,"O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining
'Til he appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, o hear the angels' voices
O night divine, o night when Christ was born
O night divine, o night, o night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, o hear the angels' voices
O night divine, o night when Christ was born
O night divine, o night divine, o yes, it was

(O night divine)
Oh yes, it was
(O night divine)
O, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
(O night divine)
It was a holy, holy, holy, holy
(O night divine)
Oh, oh, oh, yes it was

O night divine, o night
O night divine, o night
O night divine",O Holy Night

You better not cry	
Better not pout	
I'm telling you why	
Santa Claus is coming to town	
He's making a list	
And checking it twice;	
Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice	
Santa Claus is coming to town	
He sees you when you're sleeping	
He knows when you're awake	
He knows if you've been bad or good	
So be good for goodness sake!

Better not pout

Il Volo,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Il Volo,"I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Es como si 
Faltara el aire 
Si no estas aquí 
Los colores se van 
Quien ha dicho que el amor es un mundo de alegría? 
Ignazio 
Y ahora que	
Toco tu cara 
Respiro 
Yo también 

Un prisionero 
Libre ahora 
Desde el día en que me enamore 
No te vayas nunca 
Piero 
Y eres esplendida 
Inigualable 
Con tus ojos en los míos 
Sin hablar, quédate junto a mi 

Gianluca 
Así de esplendida 
Así de increíble 
Te llevaste de mi corazón 
Estoy sin aliento 
Vivo solo contigo 
Ignazio 
Movería montañas 
Por ti 
Océanos y mares 

Yo navegaría 
Caminaría 
Me perdería 
Iria a donde quieras que estés 
Piero 
Así de esplendida 
Así de increíble 
Te llevaste mi corazón 
Estoy sin aliento 
Vivo solo contigo

Y dime que 
No te iras 
Que no me dejaras 
Y eres esplendida 
Inigualable 
Con tus ojos en los míos 

Sin hablar, quédate junto a mi

Así de esplendida 
Así de increíble 
Te llevaste mi corazón 
Estoy sin aliento 
Vivo solo contigo",Esplendida
