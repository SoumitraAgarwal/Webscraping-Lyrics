Charlie Daniels,"I was blinded by bright lights
lost in the darkness
And sin kept my life in a whirl
Lust, greed and money and sensual pleasures
Mark the boundaries of my narrow world
I was headed for hell but as far as I fell
Your Spirit still followed me down
Then when I hit the bottom and cried out for mercy
You picked me up off the ground

[Chorus]
Heart of my heart, rock of my soul
You changed my life when You took control
Thy will be done, God's only Son
Faithful and true
Lord of all Lords, King of all Kings
The sweet sacrifice of praises we bring
Worthy's the Lamb, all that I am
I give to you

Satan kept telling me that it was too late
I'd committed the unpardonable sin
But I knew he was lyin' when I felt conviction
Tug on my heart strings again
I'm not proud of the past but I can't do a thing
To make up for the time that I've lost
Now my heart and my soul
And what life I have left
I lay at the foot of the cross

[Chorus]

I give to You
Heart of my heart",Heart of My Heart
Charlie Daniels,"The hero in the big white house
Shakes his head and moans about
The misery of his fellow man
Just as though he really cared
While the hand he holds behind his back
Conceals the truth from those he is deceivin'
The camera rolls another reel
While the robots on the hill
Are dashing madly to and fro
Smiling at the status quo
While in the secret, smoke-filled rooms
They sell the very air that you are breathing
When it's payback time
And you take that final ride
When there is no place to run to
And there ain't no place to hide
The supreme court of the universe
Where justice is not blind
And no prisoners will be taken
When it's payback time
Another day, another knife
Another precious unborn life
Will never see the light of day
Will never run or jump or play
It's just another sacrifice
To that greenback god of choice you are serving
Their blood cries out to be avenged
And someday you will cower and cringe
Where the books don't lie and the judge don't deal
No high-priced lawyers to appeal
Where the verdict is eternal
And you can't escape the verdict you're deserving
When it's payback time and heaven rules supreme
When your gold and silver's worthless
And you stand before the King
When your nightmares are reality
And there is no exit sign
And it's too late for repentance
When it's payback time
The sun comes up the pendulum swings
And each new frightening morning brings
The children's cries, the cannon roar
More loudly than the day before
The wax of time is drippin' down
From both ends of that candle burning brightly
A mighty shout, a trumpet blast
When the last is first and the first is last
The world is hushed and time stands still
And the final chapter is fulfilled
The sky will part each knee will bow
To greet the awesome hour of His returning
When it's payback time
And the sheep are gathered in
When the roll is called up yonder
And eternity begins
When the wedding supper's ready
And the faithful called to dine
Who'll be sitting at the table
When it's payback time
Payback time ",Payback Time
Charlie Daniels,"Wild as a coastal barronca swift as the wind blowing free
With two eyes like fire brands that glow in the night
Somewhere up there he's waiting for me
And he knows that I'm coming' for him and I just can't rest till I find
That raven black stallion that wears no man's brand with a wild restless spirit like mine
They call him Caballo Diablo half-horse half-devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw up a top the Sierra Madre

Two men before tried to take him they had their chance one by one
But each met his fate when those flashing' black hooves
Brought death 'neath the Mexican sun
Still I can't leave I must find him you fool of a horse can't you see
Well I may be half man but the other half's devil and you're just exactly like me
They call him Caballo Diablo

Even the breezes stopped moving hush now be still
Don't make a sound stay close to the ground cause he's waitin' just over that hill
Downwind behind him move quickly do it fast now he's starting to stir
Grab a handful of mane and up on to his back
And start raking him down with your spurs
But try as he will he can't shake me as over the precipice we go
To shed the life blood of a horse and a man on the rocky sierra below
They call him Caballo Diablo",Caballo Diablo
Charlie Daniels,"It rained all night in Frisco and my sleeping bag got soaked
I woke up this morning, I was cold and wet and broke
I lit up my last cigarette at the California line
But I got Dixie on my mind

I flagged down a semi going into Denver town
It was snowing in them Rockies and he had to shut her down
And them Colorado Rocky Mountains sure are lookin' fine
But I got Dixie on my mind

Well, I got me a ride through Texas on a flat bed diesel truck
He said, ""Where are you going?"", I said ""It don't matter much""
Just drop me anywhere below that Mason Dixon Line
'Cause I got Dixie on my mind

I love that sippin' whiskey, Carolina Mountain Dew
And them Alabama hotcakes and that Georgia burnin' stew
I'm crazy about magnolia trees and honeysuckle vines
And I got Dixie on my mind

Just drop me anywhere below that Mason Dixon Line
'Cause I got Dixie on my mind
I got Dixie on my mind",Dixie on My Mind
Charlie Daniels,"People say I'm no good and crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money but I damn sure got it made

'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone

Preacher man talking on T.V.
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone

A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone",Long Haired Country Boy
Charlie Daniels,"Look a-yonder comin', comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin', comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special bringin' my baby back

Well, I'm going down to Florida and get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy and get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special and lose these New York blues

""Say man, when you going back to Florida?""
""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will""
""Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?""
""Well, I don't care if I do-die do-die, do-die, do-die""

Hey talk about a-ramblin' she's the fastest train on the line

Charlie Daniels,"Every time I hear a fiddle and it's cookin' just a little
Well, it makes me want to jump up and run
And if he's sawing with some soul boogie woogie rock 'n' roll
Well, I know I'm gonna have some fun

And when the rosin' starts to fly and I'm lookin' in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse
Mama, call the doctor 'cause your boy has got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues

I met a man from Tennessee, this is what he said to me
He said, ""Music is a rhapsody""
He picked up his violin, stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony

I said, ""That ain't the way it's done, let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two""
He said, ""You'd better call the doctor 'cause I think I've got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues""

Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march

It's got to pick me up and roll me over
It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing

So let me rosin' up my bow and I think that I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it, kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna put some fire on these strings

And if you feel your feet start moving to the beat
And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes
Well you'd better call the doctor 'cause you've probably got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues",Play Me Some Fiddle
Charlie Daniels,"Well you pass around the pipe and you all get high
You never even stop and wonder why
Maybe it's because you wanna die
Maybe it's just the way things have to be

Well you stay up late and you drink too damn much whiskey
You know that sort of thing is kind of risky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel frisky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel free

Saddle tramp, how many people watch you ridin' by?
Like a thunder cloud that floats across the Arizona sky
And wonder if they're lookin' at a mighty happy man
Or just a lonely breeze that drifts across the endless desert sand

Well it's gettin' kinda cold in Readosa
Abilene ain't gettin' any closer
One more drink, one more hand of poker
'Cause a fool and his money's gonna have to part

You're too proud to ever show your sorrow
You don't steal and you won't beg or borrow
You may be here today but you're gone tomorrow
There ain't no strings on your boot heels or your heart

Saddle tramp, how many people watch you ride away?
Wonder why you never promise to come back some day
Maybe thinkin' you were holdin' all the pieces in your hand
Or are they slippin' through your fingers like the endless desert sand?",Saddle Tramp
Charlie Daniels,"'Got on a plane in Fresco and got off in Vietnam.
I walked into a different world, the past forever gone.
I could have gone to Canada or I could have stayed in school.
But I was brought up differently. I couldn't break the rules.

Thirteen months and fifteen days, the last ones were the worst.
One minute I kneel down and pray And the next I stand and curse.
No place to run to where I did not feel that war.
When I got home I stayed alone and checked behind each door.

Still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am Still in Saigon in my mind!

The ground at home was covered with snow. And I was covered in sweat.
My younger brother calls me a killer and My daddy calls me a vet.
Everybody says that I'm someone else That I'm sick and there's no cure.
Damned if I know who I am. There was only one place I was sure
When I was 

Still in Saigon
Still in Saigon.
I am still in Saigon in my mind!

Every summer when it rains, I smell the jungle, I hear the planes.
I can't tell no one I feel ashamed. Afraid someday I'll go insane.

That's been ten long years ago and time has gone on by.
But now and then I catch myself
Eyes searchin' through the sky.
All the sounds of long ago will be forever in my head.
Mingled with the wounded's cries and the silence of the dead

'Cause I'm 
Still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon in my mind",Still in Saigon
Charlie Daniels,"Do you know me? ,
Of course you do! ,
Though maybe you haven't seen me in a little while
I'm that drum beat comin' through your car radio
And I'm that thumpin' bass that drags you along with the rhythm
I'm that part of music that makes you wanna dance

I'm a pure gospel song issuing forth from a Sunday morning church house
Jesus!, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
I'm a happy crystal ring of a high mountain fiddle
I'm the blues at midnight oozing out of a back street honky-tonk
I'm draw my nourishment from the teeming streets of New York City
The lonely grain covered plains of Minnesota
From cabaret and camp meeting, and bayou and beer joint and good times and ghettos
I was born in a house of New Orleans traveling up the river on the North bound paddle leaders
I was nurtured in the Mississippi delta when seeds of the blues sprang forth in the rich black soil
I was there when Elvis learned to sing, when BB got his first guitar
I'm black and white and smooth and rough and hard and soft
I'm the roots of American music
And I'm always there just the local service
And when the chaff of trend and bad is swept aside
I'm exposed again
Strong, pulsating and very much alive
The winds of change may blow the tree away
But the roots remain, then, now and until the end","Then, Now and Until the End [#]"
Charlie Daniels,"I woke up on a cement floor this mornin',
My head felt like somebody been walkin' on it,
Don't know how I got here,
Don't remember nothin' at all,
but if I done all the things that they say I did,
well I sure musta had a ball
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time
Well I ain't got a cent of the money I had
I spent it
Shirts tore, my shoes got a big hole in it,
There's a king size knot on the side of my head
And I got one big black eye
But brother if you think I look bad,
You oughtta see that other guy
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time
Well this nine pound hammer feels like it weighs a ton
Makin lil' ones outta big ones in this red hot Kansas sun
I just hope I can make it 30 more days
And get out of this mess I'm in,
And if I ever get back to Mississippi
I ain't ever gonna leave again
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time

Charlie Daniels,"I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande

A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

Charlie Daniels,"He was nobly born
Had a spanish bull's horn
And not one scar on his hansom face

He stood like a prince
And he had ever since
He had grandily walked into the place

Though the girls of Madrid
Tonight were forbid
For tomorrow he must fight once more

Before he left the bar
He would dance with them all
Cause he was El Toreador

The day of the feast
Was just a lie in the east
When he left Maria's warm bed

Her dark eyes said more
But he walked thru the door
Shaking cobwebs of dreams from his head

And later that day
As he knelt to pray
He said God grant me this nothing more

If it is the way
And I must die today
Let me die like a Toreador

The pageant he chose
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, round and round
On and on, all alone

The Plaza del Toros
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, 
Round and round
On and on, all alone

The shouts of ole
In the heat of the day
Rushed the hot blood to his Spanish heart

And the crowd held their breath
As he flirted with death
And the bull fighter's sword found it's mark

And trying to hide
The wound in his side
He walked from the ring standing tall

And a crowd gathered round
As he fell to the ground
A priest held his hand
Where he lay in the sand
And he was heard to say
A brave bull died today
But he died like a Toreador",El Toreador [Live]
Charlie Daniels,"When my way groweth drear, precious Lord, linger near
When my life, my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, won't you take my hand, lead me on, let me stand
'Cause I am tired and I am weak and I am worn
Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home, lead me home

And the day, when my day is past and gone
Oh, at the river I stand, would You guide my feet and please hold my hand

Charlie Daniels,"Brother afar from the Savior today,
Risking your soul for the things that decay,
Oh, if today God should call it away,
What would you give in exchange for your soul? 
Refrain:
What would you give? What would you give?
What would you give in exchange for your soul?
Oh, if today God should call it away,
What would you give in exchange for your soul?
Mercy is calling you, won't you give heed?
Must the dear Savior still tenderly plead?
Risk not your soul, it is precious indeed;
What would you give in exchange for your soul?

Charlie Daniels,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",Softly and Tenderly
Charlie Daniels,"He's the loosest dude I've ever been exposed to
He loves the bottle and a dirty joke
He likes to hang out on the street
And he'd rather fight than eat
And his nose and the women's been broke [?] 

He's been in every jail from here to Juarez
And every funky old backstreeet saloon

A hundred years too soon

And I hope to he** he stays in Tennessee

He didn't finish school or go to college
When he turned 16 he just had to go
And while everyone who did
Was building homes and having kids
He was out West ridin' in some rodeo

He got busted up in Cheyenne last September
And he had to get his hat and pack his trunk
And he came on back to town,
He just kinda hangs around

And you may think that where he's at's nowhere
And in your righteous sight,
You just might be right
But he da## sure did have fun gettin there

He's a outlaw, He's a bum
He's a rounder and then some

Charlie Daniels,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Charlie Daniels,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history
",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Charlie Daniels,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten, 
and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white ",White Christmas

And it lingers in my heart tonight

Charlie Haden,"An early photograph
Of the young braid with the confident grin
Who is celebrating his first defeat
By clouching a haircut from his skull

The pig tail
In death of modern man
Like a young braid with a price on his head
Delilahs and Samsons

Stands the accused the symbol is clear
Cut from his skull
The long hair
The long hair

If this is the missing link
The threaded locks getting down to remain
Unable to avoid the sacrifice
The short back and side

The closest shave
The pig tail

First you must think and then you began

Seemingly retreating
The coiling spring is triggered to leave father ahead
The long march",Chairman Mao [Live]
Charlie Haden,"As long as there's music and words of romance
The spell of a theme starts
You to dream there's always a chance
As long as there's music, whatever the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

Charlie Haden,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Charlie Haden,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Charlie Haden,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Charlie Haden,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Charlie Haden,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Might as well get used to you hanging around

Charlie Haden,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Comfort and joy, 
O tidings of comfort and joy! 

From God our heavenly Father

And unto certain shepherds 
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born

Comfort and joy, 
O tidings of comfort and joy!

Of a pure virgin bright,

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.",It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

The with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!",Nearer My God to Thee
Charlie Haden,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

[Chorus]

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

[Chorus]

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

[Chorus]",The Old Rugged Cross
Charlie Haden,"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
The joys I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing through the air,
""Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!""",Sweet Hour of Prayer
Charlie Haden,"Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on,
Let me stand
I'm tired, I am weak I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry,
Hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet,
Hold my hand

Charlie Haden,"Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?

Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?

Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?

Charlie Haden,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time","Body And Soul [Live From Montreal International Jazz Festival, Canada /"
Charlie Haden,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings

My deepest stains now clean.

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle
In the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night 
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet

Charlie Kunz,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide",Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer/In My Arms/Take It from There

Come on son let's go out and play
Sometimes it seems like yesterday
I'd climb upon the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him

No matter how many tears I cry
No matter how many years go by

We cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me
Wind blows through the trees
Streetlights they still shine bright
Moon still looks the same?

Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him

Watching the sun come up as everyone failed to see
The music was always loud and I'd smoke and drink too much
Till I fell into your arms into your loving touch
Now as the years roll by time has reeled me in
Slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then

Those old ways of mine I left them behind
Those crazy days are through
The only thing I still do like I use to do
Is carry this torch for you

Do you remember when we packed our bags and run
Chasing some crazy dream into the morning sun
Now as the twilight falls I find I'm satisfied
Watching the fire glow just as long as you're by my side
You're in my heart it seems time has passed me by
I love you as much today if very first time

But, I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows
Now, the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, well she's going down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly

There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

And when the rain falls and the wind blows and the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe your love takes good care of me

When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I run to the arms of the one I love and there I'll hide
You know just what to do and say you make my life worth while
And when I look upon your face I see heaven in your smile
Cause your love takes...
I'll be safe your love takes good care of me

Charlie Louvin,"[ with Diane McCall ]

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If you worked your hands in wood and if you'd ask me
I'd answer you baby yes I would I'd place you above me

Save my love through loneliness save my love through sorrow
I've given you my ownliness so give me your tomorrow
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your pretty clothes and your soft shoes shining
And if a thinker were your trade you'd still find me
I'd be carrying the pots you've made and following behind you

Save my love through loneliness...
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby

Charlie Louvin,"Morning's come and Lord my mind is aching
That old sunshine stands silent at my door
But just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
As my tears go tumbling to the floor

Once again the whole town will be talking
Yes Lord I've seen the pity in their eyes
Cause they'll never understand it's her sorrow and not a man
Ah but no matter what they say I know she tried

Yes baby's packed her soft things and left me
But I just know she didn't mean to be unkind
No it's not her heart Lord it's her mind she didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye

Could you estimate how many eight or nine

Then how about a nice big that would be just fine
Is there any special way oh no whatever you say
I just wondered have you ever all the time

Is he as old oh no he's young and in his prime

To turn back the time and be a boy again and see the sun come up every morning
A quarter of a mile to the grocery store school bus came within a mile off my door

And here in distance of a cotton gin a thirty minute walk to Ruby
Oh I'd walk it in the moonlight oh I'd walk it on the dark night

At the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jail house

No credit plan
No time to chase you

On a laundry slip
I had a good, hardy jailor
With a six gun hip
He let me call long distance
She said, ""Number, please""
An' just as soon as I told her
She shouted back at me

To satisfy emotions that are shared between us
A winter love is cozy but I need more
It just intensifies my want to have a love that endures

But when the leaves are gone does that love disappear

And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Charlie May,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Charlie May,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Charlie May,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes

Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Charlie McCoy,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I love you for all the joy you brought me
The lovely night you taught me our Cuban love song
One melody will always thrill my heart
One kiss will cheer me when we're far apart
(Dear one) I love you with such a tender passion

I know down deep inside

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over

I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""

She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Charlie Parker,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Charlie Parker,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

You took my heart and threw my heart away

You gave me nights of cheer

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end

Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes
Charlie Parker,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks
Charlie Parker,scatting,Lemon Drop
Charlie Parker,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Charlie Parker,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Charlie Parker,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,
A passing glow, a moment's gladness,
Yes it's love.
I knew it on the night we met,
You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.

With every kiss I know that

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

That brings this sensation, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Charlie Paxson,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

Otherwise I get chilly to the bone.

All around the porch grew ivy 
    and a pathway strewn with leaves
In a cozy little parlor sitting close beside the fire
Was a happy little family at home

Those were the days baby you were truth
And nothing you could do would ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts don’t forget what they do

But somewhere down the line I left you hanging
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend, I’ll never break your heart again

'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are

You’re queen to my throne now
It’s you at all times
I’ll never reject you
I’ll love and respect you
'Cause you’re my lifeline
Only thing on my wishlist
Your love and forgiveness
For that I will climb
(Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times)
Why would I fight it?
I know that it’s right when you’re holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I’ll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I’m yours
You know that I’m yours

'Cause I, I will always love you

Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left

Just to prove it didn’t mean that much
I’d sell everything I own, take a pile of cash
Walk into the casino, bet it all on black
Then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
To make out with you in the back, hey

Then I’d carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at midnight

Get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
I’ll a cappella karaoke “Sexy Thing”, 'cause baby I feel no shame
Say this whole world can know you’re all I need
'Cause baby some day I’ll drop and hit one knee and tell you

Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Well, I saw you walkin' with him just the other night
I almost flipped when I saw him squeeze you tight
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Don't you remember all the things that we used to do
Before he came along and looked at you
Don't you remember when you said you loved me so
Baby, now please don't go

And I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do
Because If you like him, and I know he likes you
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Don't you remember all the things that we used so do

Charlie Rich,"Well I was born in Macon, Georgia
They kept my Daddy in the Macon jail
He said, ""son, if you keep your hands clean
You wont hear those bloodhounds on your trail""

Well I fell in with bad companions
I robbed a man up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

Well I washed off my hands in muddy water
I washed off my hands, but they didn't come clean
I tried to do like my daddy told me
I must have washed off my hands in a muddy stream

I asked the jailer, I said ""now when's my time up?""
He said ""son, no we won't forget
And if you try and just keep your hands clean
We may just make a good man of you yet""

I couldn't wait to get my time in
I broke out, broke out the Nashville jail
I just crossed Atlanta, Georgia
And I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail

I washed off my hands in muddy water
I washed off my hands, but they didn't come clean

My little girl a running after me

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow me down, some 'cause you're making me run

That her daddy had to run and catch a train
She had no way of knowing I was leaving home for good
I turned around and there she was again

Before I head home, I make a stop along the way
A couple of drinks, wait for the 5 o'clock rush to go by

And almost always there's a lady
Oh, and it's so hard, she starts coming on
I back it on up, turn it around and take it on home

Sometimes I've gotta go out of town
I'll be gone for a couple of days
And this buddy of mine he's a hound in the first degree

And almost always there's the ladies
And it ain't easy there out and alone
But I back it on up, turn it around, take it on home

I take it on home to a woman who sticks by me
'Cause I believe she'd do the same if she was me
And I wouldn't know where to turn to if she was gone

And staggered all around
I've heard a scream and saw the car
That knocked him to the ground

And raised his head
He must have thought she was his mama
Because these words he said

Mama, my wife has gone and left me
Mama, she left with my best friend
Mama, I was coming home to tell you
So mama, take me home
And help me live and love again

I saw him laying there, his broken body wrecked with pain
I wanted so to help him but I was too ashamed
He rolled his head from side to side, struggling for his life
You don't know how I felt 'cause I'm the friend that took his wife

Mama, they took my babies from me
Mama, she loves another man
Mama, it's gettin' hard to see now

Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me?

It was here on Madena that we made our home
The year 1850 and I sent for my girl

Up through Louisianan to meet up with Grant

And the life they was livin' was shot all to hell
But we ain't seen nothin' no different than dust
Sept the wheels on the wagon all covered with rust

And that scrape with old Hitler was over and done
And I wondered if I could kill kin with my gun
But we sat there in Paris in a little cafe
And as they toasted Truman, I drifted away
To Indianola

But it's fifty years later and nobody cares
About some old city that ain't even there

And they work in the Gulf
With seven days on and seven days off

From first quality federal the foreclosures branch
And he calls me hillbilly and he laughs at my hair

When in walked a woman, looking richer than sin

Well, I followed her home and when she was alone
Well, I put my gun to her head
And I don't recall what happened next at all
But now that rich woman, she is dead

And the moon is so bright it don't look like night
And the diamond how it sparkles in the lights of loving county

But she opened that door and I knelt on the floor
And I put that ring in her hand
Then she said, ""I do"" and she'd leave with me soon

Well, I told her to hide that ring there inside
And wait 'til the timing was good
And I drove back home and I was alone

He said, he'd seen her downtown, sashaying around
And her diamond how it sparkled in the lights of loving county

Well that sheriff, he found me out wandering
All around El Paso the very next day
You see, I'd lost my mind on that broken white line
Before I even reached Balmorhea

Well, now she's in Fort Worth and she's just giving birth
To the son of that oil company man
And they buried that poor old sheriff's dead wife
With the ring that I stole on her hand

With his wife and kids inside

So I sit here on the roadside
And I talk to your machine
I can see the flames a rising
Over Nashville Tennessee

Well, don't go out looking on your TV
They gonna keep this all discreet

Don't think I seen a single classroom,
But I drank a lot of beer.
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year.

[Chorus]

Now I got myself a little band,
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair,
And I never learned how to dress.
So I'm leaving for the last time honey,
I'm never more to roam.
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home.

So I'll see you in Nashville,
If I ever get out that way.
I'll see you in Austin,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowin down.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.",My Hometown
Charlie Robison,"Well, I wish I had my picture on The Rolling Stone today
I wish that The Enquirer spread a rumor that I was gay
Well, I wish I had some buddies, some movie stars and such
'Cause I probably wouldn't worry about the two of us as much

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today

You know I, I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada, she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard, my hair blowin' in the wind
And I'd stop at fancy restaurants and they'd finally let me in

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today

Yeah, I wish I had my picture with the Rolling Stones today
And I wish The Enquirer would spread a rumor that I was gay
I wish I knew a movie star, someone like Charlie Sheen
'Cause if he'd hang out with Kato Kaelin well I guess he'd hang out with me

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and Rogaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today",Sunset Boulevard
Charlie Robison,"My name is John O'Reilly 
And my father worked the fields
In the hills of old Kilarny
Where I helped him turn the wheels
My arms grew hard as iron for a boy of 17
And I used my fists for gambling in those wet Kilarny streets

Well the ship left for America and I brought my pack aboard
Said goodbye to my dear Ireland said a prayer to my dear Lord
I fought those sorry guineas in the kitchen they called hell
I fought them for their dollar and those guineas paid me well

[Chorus]
Fair thee well fair Dover
Fair thee well your seasons turn
For my pockets will be jingling on the day of my return
The day of my return

I fought in New York City and I fought the Jersey shore
My gut stayed full of whiskey and my bed stayed full of whores
They called my right a cannonball and my left they called the same
I left em' all lyin' half in blood and half in shame

I met a man on '32 and he stuck out his hand
And he offered me a thousand if I'd fall before his man
I said it could be done but only for another two
He smiled at me and nodded as I stuck it in my shoe

[Chorus]

They rang the bell two times before I let him have my nose
And I let him work my left until my eye was swollen closed
Then I let loose a right that they still talk about today
For that guinea didn't know that I had bet the other way

They covered every dock and every port there on the coast
Looking for that double crosser who had turned into a ghost
But I was on a train my friend that rode the other way
And i'll sail from California back to Dublin one fine day",John O'Reilly
Charlie Robison,"[Chorus]
Well they call me the life of the party
They call her the belle of the ball
Well we start before anybody
And I promise we'll outlast them all

Well it started when I was in high school
My mom and my dad taught me well
A bottle of wine at Thanksgiving
And a valum when Grandma raised hell
Sso I had some champaigne at a wedding
I belive that they called it Cold Duck
And they girl I'd been eyeing all evening
She took me round back and we sucked down the rest of that bottle
And things really started to click
Well we kissed on the boxes of liquor
And she reached down and grabbed her some dickle and added some cola
Far be it for me should I pass
For I thought that if I drank another
I'd certainly need me some Aspirin on the next morning
I'd tried not to make me a sound
'cause the girl who was sleeping beside me had gained herself two-hundred
Pounding on my bedroom window
My Dad yelled to jump out of bed
But she woke up from all the commotion
Insisting she'd give me some headlines she'd read in the paper
She said it had been yesterday
They said if you use moderation
My mornings could all be this way

Charlie Robison,"Well, I hear that old John Deere tractor
At the low water bridge
Pulling the young drinkers across
He's dragging so many on this Saturday night
I can smell that old tractor's exhaust

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast

Well, there's a place down on Main Street
Right across from the bank
Somebody drew one on the line
About twenty foot up on that Frontier Hotel
Where crested back in twenty-nine

Well, this city took most of this little old town
'Cause we live on what they call the flame
Well, I read all about it in the cafe downtown
Where they got that old newspaper frame

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
The cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast

My grandmother called about ten minutes ago
Like she does almost every night
She said they come home way early from the old rodeo
When a big boat had knocked off the lights

Well, she said a cowboy got buckin'
Just before it went dark
On a boat that they called 'Chequered Tree'
And ain't nobody's saw if he finished his ride
So I guess I'll forget about sleep

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most

Charlie Robison,"Well, you are still here
And I am still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
You went a semester to West Texas State
But the freshmen fifteen you gained
Killed all your dates
I guess I still love you if I ever did
And I can see myself having a couple of kids
And we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

Well, I am still here
And you are still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
Though weight's not an issue you have gained more
And when I said I do well I slammed all the doors
To a future where I could see Paris in spring
And I wasn't prepared for the weight of this ring
But we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

So play some old BTO
For my friends don't you know
Keep your dogs in the truck
Til you leave

Get out the wieners and buns
Cause the briskets all gone
At our wedding in suburban Seguin

I said I love you in suburban Seguin
Now lets make love

Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town

We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down

I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat

And start dying little by little piece by piece

And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels

Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highway's bright

Charlie Ryan,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'

Charlie Sexton,"When you're near me I feel so romantic
When you're far away I'm always blue
If you want me to remain romantic
Here are all the things you'll have to do
 
Hold me honey won't you hold he
Hold me never let me go
Take me honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me
'Cause I love you so
Thrill me, let your kisses thrill me
Just like you alone can do
Hold me tenderly enfold me
Never try to hold me from you
 
I love every little thing about you
Every thing you say and all you do
I would be a total loss without you
What becomes of me is up to you
 
Hold me honey won't you hold me
Hold me never let me go
Take me honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me

Charlie Sexton,"She said, ""Ain't this some congregation?
Ain't this some kind of crowd?""
Spit in the eye of creation
So educated and powers

Their plans are outrageous
And the tales are so tall
The conversation's contagious
But their talk is so small

Sidewalks and the streets
Are overflowing with dread
Every night down here
Is night of the living dead

You don't belong here
You know it's true
Oh, you look all wrong here
Don't know how to act or do
But you know sometimes I think
I don't belong here too

Walking down the fire
It's like shedding your skin
And throw your clothes out the window
Oh, face the person within

It's like dying in public
It's like learning to fly
Leaving the world behind you
It's like being born thrice

You're probably right, all right
But this is my home
What kind of home is that
Living on long death row?

You don't belong here
You're just passing through
Oh, you look around here
Man, you're just not that cruel

You don't belong here
You should know it's true
Oh, you don't belong here

But he was walking 'round in rags

It was a fantastic fight
Oh, was impressing the girls

We was impressing the Russians
Even impressed the Chinese

We had 'em down on their knees

Broke the code
And surround the building at dawn
But they had disappeared mysteriously

Charlie Sexton,"Time to walk away
You've run out of things to say
Everything ends up the same old story
You don't know where love went
But nothing's making sense
You both know you can't fake it anymore

Don't look back he'll see you cryin'
Don't look back on love that& dyin'
Make believe your heart is made of stone
Don't look back into his eyes
You've already said goodbye
It's over now you've got to let him go

He's the one you love
But sometimes love is not enough
It's too complicated to explain
No you never will forget
But you'll get over it
Someday just sweet memories will remain

So don't look back; don't break your will
Don't look back at him until
You're far enough to let your feelings show
Don't look back into those eyes
You've gone back so many times
It's over now you've got to let him go
There's a time for everything including leavin'
There's a time the heart admits defeat
And starts its grieving",Don't Look Back

Pretty girls are swimming in the sea
Oh they look like sisters in the ocean
The boy will fill his pail with salted water
And the storms will blow from off towards New Orleans

The sun shines on Biloxi
The air is filled with vapors from the sea
And the boy will dig a pool beside the ocean
He sees creatures from a dream under the water
And the sun will set from off towards New Orleans

We are walking in the evening by the ocean
We are splashing naked in the water

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Charlie Shavers,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Alone where we have walked together

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Charlie Spivak,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Did you see something in my eyes?

Darlin' can you feel the achin' in my heart?
Remember when I told you we would never part?

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

Charlie Ventura,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Love flew out again

This funny thing called love?

Charlie Walker,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
 
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand. 
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair 
And a smile that a girl understands. 
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, ""I need you!""
""Let me take you away and be your man.""
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.",Almost Persuaded
Charlie Walker,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart

Charlie Waller,"I am a jolly farmer, and i just came to town
To sell a bale of cotton boys, I'd worked the whole year round
Listen to me all of you farmers, if you wanna learn some sense
If you want to see them electric lights, just look right over the fence
when i walked down the street, the old clock was striking nine
along came old sadie jones, won't you take a little drink of mine
I must have bought a dozen drinks, cos it hit my pocket book hard
I wish I'd bought me a half a pint and stayed in the wagon yard ",Stay in the Wagon Yard
Charlie Waller,"There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere
In a distant land so many miles away.
Only Uncle Sam's great heroes get to go there
Where I wish that I could also live some day.
I'd see Lincoln, Custer, Washington and Perry,
And Nathan Hale and Colin Kelly, too.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
Waving o'er the land of heroes brave and true.

In this war with its mad schemes of destruction
Of our country fair and our sweet liberty,
By the mad dictators, leaders of corruption,
Can't the U. S. use a mountain boy like me?
God gave me the right to be a free American,
And for that precious right I'd gladly die.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
That is where I want to live when I die.
 
Though I realize I'm crippled, that is true, sir,
Please don't judge my courage by my twisted leg.
Let me show my Uncle Sam what I can do, sir,
Let me help to bring the Axis down a peg.
If I do some great deed I will be a hero,
And a hero brave is what I want to be.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
In that heaven there should be a place for me.

Charlie Watts,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending

But a fool can have her charms

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.

Charlie Watts,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Charlie Watts,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me

If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags

For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable

Charlie Wilson,"It feels like a lifetime, a thousand days have passed by
Since I held you close to me
If I could see that smile from my friend
I know that I could live again
I need you here with me

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right now you're so far away
I hope and I pray
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay

Girl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you
Never noticed what it feels like to be without you
Feels like I took my last step and my last breath in
my life ending
Had to say just what I was feeling, girl
Cause my sun doesn't shine, sun doesn't shine without you

This is more for me than for you
Girl, I finally see there's no substitute
For what we have
Do you know how much I love you

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right now you're so far away
Gonna tell you and show you
Do whatever I can do to get back to you

With all of this fortune, what am I doin' single
Sometimes I tell myself, ""Man, get out and mingle""
You don't have to be alone, you need someone to love
But being famous sometimes it's hard to find someone to trust
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Being in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well, yea

Now, I ain't got nobody to ride in my new Coupe with
Ain't even got nobody to chill with on the weekend
This is just a house, until someone makes it a home
Love don't count me out, cause I'm so all alone
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Bein' in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well

Charlie Wilson,"I've been seeing you around
Something's got you down
I could never seem to figure out
Why a lady so pretty is always wearing a frown
I could turn that to a smile
Sit and talk with me a while
I could show you love, care, and concern
Give me a chance

I'll be your every answer
To all the hurting questions, lessons that kept you guessing
If you would just come to me
Give me all your attention
My love will make things better
And I bet you, if you let me, I'll make you happy, baby, please

[Chorus]
Baby, just let me love you
I promise I'll look out for you
I'll be the man to spoil you, girl
That's my guarantee
Baby, just let me show you
I'll put in work just for you
When it comes to you, it's whatever, girl
That's my guarantee

Throw on my gator shoes and slacks

You wear that dress with the open back
I'm gonna scoop you up
We'll go stepping, no questions
Dipping you slow, girl, you're a fox, I'll never go, oh
And we could have this kind of fun
Every weekend if you want
All you gotta do is let me show you what my kind of love can do

I'll be your every answer
To all the hurting questions, lessons that kept you guessing
If you would just come to me
Give me all your attention
My love will make things better
And I bet you, if you let me, I'll make you happy, baby, please

You deserve better, you're a jewel
And I recognize the obstacles
That are qualified for loving you
Just give me a chance, chance on love
Can't you see
That the best thing for you is me

[Chorus]",My Guarantee
Charlie Wilson,"The things you say you do, you don't do
In fact, it's just the opposite of all of the words that come from you
And sometimes I sit around waiting
You say you come but you never show
That's not the way you treat your woman

The promise you make, you don't keep
Instead you go and to the very thing you know that hurts me
What I'm trying to get you to see
Is that your better half has needs
You don't have to say a word to me

[Chorus]
Baby just show me you love me
And you won't have to say a word
Just show me you love me
And you won't have to say a word
I don't wanna let you go
Breaking up would be absurd
If you just show me you love me
Then you don't have to say a word

Like sometimes you say you're right, but you be wrong
And still I take the blame, took all my pain
Cause I don't wanna argue all night long

Oh I toss and turn through the night
The morning comes and you are still not by my side
That's not the way you treat your woman

You said that you would be faithful, I can't tell
In fact you show me things that let me know
That your heart is somewhere else
What I'm trying to get you to see
Is that your better half has needs
You don't have to say a word to me

Baby just show me you love me
And you won't have to say a word
Just show me you love me
And you won't have to say a word
Word, word, word you won't have to say a
Word, word, you won't have to say a word
No baby, you won't have to say a word

You don't have to say a word, no no
Word no

Just show me you love me
You won't have to say a word
Hey, just show me that you love me
Sometimes you have to show me
Hey she said, all you got to do is
Pick up the phone and call me sometimes
She said, take me to the club with you sometimes
Can you take me out to dinner with you sometimes?
Send me a bouquet of flowers sometimes?
She said get up off your lazy ass and go to work sometimes
Stop hanging out with your boys and stay in with me sometimes
I'm your woman, act like it sometimes
All I ask is that you take care of business sometimes
Can you take care of the trash for me sometimes?
Can you get in the kitchen and wash the dishes sometimes",No Words
Charlie Wilson,"Not one to have a loss for words
What I have to say you've already heard
But I don't think it will hurt to hear it again
Years have passed and your kisses feel
Even better now, soothing my heart still
How my passion fills just knowing that you're on your way home again

[Chorus]
We've been through it all
A lot of things girl,
You make my heart just skip a beat in so many ways
Only you I call until this day girl
You make my heart just skip a beat let me count the ways

Nothing's perfect we still have our days
But that doesn't mean our love will stray
If anything it takes me right back to you
Wishes answered from the very start
Before hello you have left your mark
One so deep I could not remove even if I wanted to

[Bridge]
From your warm embrace to how your kisses taste
The way you look at me, with such sincerity
I feel like every man should feel
I pinch myself to see if it's real

The letters you wrote, even the simple notes
Just you took your time to say what's on your mind
I really couldn't ask for more
Oh yea",Thru It All
Charlie Wilson,"What if you thought too much and missed out on your blessings girl?
What if you had your chance and you let it pass?
What if you lived your whole life and your heart never knew what it felt like to be loved, loved?
Could you deal with it? Could you live with yourself if you made a decision that was all wrong?
And I was long gone? And what if you were blind and couldn't see that it was me?

[Chorus]
What if I'm the one to wife you like you're supposed to be?
What if I'm the one to cop you that ten carat ring?
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better if I was just with you

What if I'm the one you should be making babies with?
I know you're the one cause I don't mind you spending all my chips
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better
I'm the one for you

Just think what if you had someone who unconditionally loved you girl
And you slipped on him and let him pass
What if God gave you what you prayed for but you didn't receive it
Cause you didn't believe it
What if you never had no one to make love with all in the kitchen

And you missed him
What if had the house, and a car, and the kids, and the dog?
What if everything you wanted, you could have it all

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And baby right now is the time for you to make up your mind
Cause tomorrow's not promised to nobody
And baby I'm convinced, it's no coincidence
Girl let me be the one to make your name Mrs. Wilson
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to break you off and get your head sprung
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to lay you down and get you naked
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Baby girl don't make me wait no more I just can't take it

I've learned to love and with you I cry.
Give anything to be with you somehow.
Settle down maybe for your love.

I've lost you once yeah and I vow that I would never lose you again.
And I would never give up again.
Cause life without you is truly ain't worth living.

[Chorus]

Oh, oh wee babe, no I cant see no oh no no,
Maybe for your love I would die and maybe for your love
I would die just tell me what to do to prove to prove to you
I'm serious",Back to Love
Charlie Wilson,"Oh oh I

I can't live without ya. I can't live without ya.

Girl you got me shook, after all of the fighting and the screaming
Snatched up the keys then you got in the range knowing that its raining
(why'd I let you go) I don't know how long it took but I know that I drove all around,
Trying to calm you down wouldn't answer my calls, now I'm scared girl where'd you go

Damn girl why'd you leave like that? whatever I said didn't mean it like that,
How you expect for me not to fight back when you scream like that, girl I love you more than that.
The other night at the club when I hit off a blunt. I love you more that.
When I smile at a butt cause your all that I want.

I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do.
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya.
And girl it breaks my heart if I broke your heart what do I do?
I can't live without ya girl, I can't live without ya baby I don't care if I'm not alright
If I could just love you tonight, I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl what do I do
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya girl

Wish I could tell you how I feel, everything that I'm working for is yours
How could I ignore when I wanna be yours girl I slam the door (right on our love)
Girl a man don't understand the difference between a penny and a dime must of lost my mind
You and me was on the grind once upon a time (why'd I let you go)

I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do.
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya.
And girl it breaks my heart if I broke your heart what do I do?
I can't live without ya girl, I can't live without ya baby I don't care if I'm not alright
If I could just love you tonight, I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl what do I do
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya girl

Girl when I find ya I'm gone stand right by ya girl
You're my life and I can't live without you

I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do.
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya.
And girl it breaks my heart if I broke your heart what do I do?
I can't live without ya girl, I can't live without ya baby I don't care if I'm not alright

When I pulled up at the mall
Couldn't find a place to park
Threw my keys to the valet
(handle that for me)
I was only there to hang
Wasn't looking for a thing
I was just about to bounce
And then I saw miss lady
Then I said to myself,

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She was coming out the shoe store
Pretty little thing
A couple of bags in her hand,
Right in front of Macy's
And then I saw her at the food court,
Sipping lemonade,and conversating
On her cell phone,looking so amazing
And I said to myself

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She gon' wear my ring
She gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout
Me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house
Meet smokey and them
If she need her hair done
I think my cousin can
I'll treat her like a queen
Give her everything
She will be my girl
Till we old and gray,
And I knew it from the moment,
That I saw her lovely, lovely face",There Goes My Baby

It feels like a lifetime, a thousand days have passed by
Since I held you close to me
If I could see that smile from my friend
I know that I could live again
I need you here with me

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right now you're so far away
I hope and I pray
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay

Girl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you
Never noticed what it feels like to be without you
Feels like I took my last step and my last breath
And my life ended

Had to say just what I was feeling, girl
'Cause my sun doesn't shine
Sun doesn't shine without you

This is more for me than for you
Girl, I finally see there's no substitute
For what we have
Do you know how much I love you?

And that we shared, I can't forget
Girl, a love like yours
I'll never let just slip away
Just promise that you'll stay

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right now you're so far away
Gonna tell you and show you
Do whatever I can do to get back to you

Seen a starless night without the moon?
Well, that's me without you?

Still feel like your all alone
If you ain't got no one to call your own
So excuse me if I said this once before
I just can't help myself I need something more

Cause I just love the way that you don't stop
And I just love the high, just don't stop
And everything you do when you don't stop
Doin' what you do to me
And no one makes me feel
How I feel with you
So don't stop, don't stop what you do to me

It's crazy when I think about
how I used to live my life without you
Wonderin' if I'd find someone
who makes me feel so good inside
If there's one thing I know for sure
I like the way it feels when we're together
And it's so good I don't want to let you go

If ever want you, the sexy way you move,
Just makes me stop and say,
And that's why I ain't going nowhere.

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't let go,
Baby you got what I need, 
You got what I need,
And I got what you want, oh baby,
Oh, I can't let go,
This is coming from my heart, you need to know,
That I just can't let you go
That I just can't let you go

You know you got that thing,
And when I get it baby
You make for sure I don't forget it baby,
Is that damn good, I want to give it to you 
Every night, every night.
You call my name and I go running to you,
Fortunate fame, I give it up for you,
Cause it wouldn't be the same,
If you wasn't standing by my side.

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't let go,
Baby you got what I need, you got what I need,
And I got what you want, oh baby,
Oh baby, I can't let go,
This is coming from my heart, I need to know,
That I just can't let you go

Baby loving you just keeps me in the zone,
If I can't have you, hey I'd rather be alone,
There's a million stars, but you're the only one,
That brightens my world, you are my sun

Oh, I can't let go,
Baby you got what I need, you got what I need,
And I got what you want, oh baby,
Oh baby, I can't let go,
This is coming from my heart, I need to know,
That I just can't let you go

Oh, I can't let go, baby baby baby
Baby you got what I need,
And I got what you want, oh baby,

Charlie Wilson,"[Snoop Dogg]
Josey Wales was known for robbing trains and things
Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[LBC Crew]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got's lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't making no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Since I was a young boy
In this world, everything's as good as bad
Now my father told me always speak a true word
And I have to say that is the best advice I've had
Because something burns inside of me
It's everything I long to be
And lies they only stop me from feeling free

Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me

Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

I've never yearned for anybody's fortune
The less I have the more I am a happy man
Now my mother told me always keep your head on
Because some may praise you just to get what they want

And I said mama I am not afraid
They will take what they will take
And what would life be like without a few mistakes

Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me

Charlie Winston,"Hello, alone, it's you and me again,
How can we pretend we've never met?
Hello, alone you might as well come in,
We've been making bets for so long now.

I never told you that I want you,
I thought I had you out of my head,
But ever time she leaves me, refusing to believe me,
You're always there.

And even though I don't invite you,
And your presence is a pain,
You always let me be just who I am,
Until I'm glad to bring back that refrain again,

Hello, alone, it's you and me again,
How can we pretend we've never met?
Hello, alone you might as well come in,
We've been shaking hands for too long now
I even tried to re-convince you,
But it was just no use at all,
Cause every time I climbed inside your mind,
I saw the mirror on the wall.

But it's no use to pose the question,
When the answers never sheen,
And then I have to face up to the facts
With saxophones and old trombones carrying me home to say

Hello, alone, it's you and me again,
How can we pretend we've never met?
Hello alone you might as well come in,
We've been making bets for too long...

Perhaps I'll take a holiday,
And get as far away as I can,
But then I'd just be far away,
And just as a much a lonesome man,
With his hat in his hands chanting.

Daddy, pretty please, can I take a ride tonight?
I swear I won't get her over fifty-five.
Was Back in Black racing through my veins, last thing I thought
Was a flip in this thing gonna get me killed.
I'm pretty sure my old man will.
And seeing his face when the wrecker hauled my freedom away
That's how I learned to pray.

It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say.

I was living like I was (?), mama always said
It'd take a special girl to get a hold of me, 
But I never let one get close to me.
The man upstairs must've heard her prayer, 
Cause I looked up, you were standin' there waitin' on me
Like you were made for me.
And I knew right then and there, I'd been saved
And that's how I learned to pray.

It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse

Without a little walk on water kind of faith.

Didn't know why but you just knew
Someone is up there lookin' out for you.
Well you know just what I mean when I say Grace.

Runnin' up and down Mississippi's crooked spine
I've been gone too long
It's high time I made time for this

A hundred miles south of Graceland's gate
Just see me comin' from the volunteer state
With a homesick heart and magnolia plates 
Off exit two-oh-six

It all gets to be too much
My soul feels out of touch
I get in my beat up ride and drive I-55

I fill up on old friends
Get back to where it all began
I always leave feelin' more alive, I-55

Rest my arm on the windowsill
Breathin' in them old pine hills
An the midnight smoke from the paper mills
To the stars off Lilly Road

This little lake town is all we got
But I love it most for what it's not
And them kids in the Chainey's parking lot
That was me ten years ago

And I never can stay
As long as I want to
And now Ma moved away
But the one thing I won't do
Is forget where I come from
You bet I'll always run
Back down that old familiar stretch of interstate

When it all gets to be too much

Como creía que tú me querías
Y que sentí en el momento
Que mi mundo te entregué

Perdido en tus promesas de amor
Viví, persiguiendo una ilusión
Y nunca protegí mi corazón

Porque ciego de amor
No pude ver, no quise ver

Que al final me dejo

Un sueño fue
Ya todo ha pasado

Promesas que ya, has olvidado

Y hoy, sólo queda realizar
Que todo aquello nunca fue verdad
Pero ciego de amor
No pude ver, no quise ver

Si otro amor me viniera a llamar
No lo quiero ni oír

Otra noche espere, otra noche sin ti
Aumento mi dolor
De cigarro en cigarro
Cenizas y humo hay en mi corazón

Vivo solo sin ti, sin poderte olvidar
Ni un momento nomas
Vivo pobre de amor en espera de quien
No me da una ilusión

Si otro amor me viniera a llamar
No lo quiero ni oír

No lo quiero ni oir",De Cigarro en Cigarro

Charlotte Church,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now i'm found
Was blind but now i see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour i first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

Walk upon England's mountains green?

Among those dark Satanic mills?

Bring me my arrows of desire!

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

There came a dream so fair,
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there

I heard the children singing
And ever as they sang,
Methought Jerusalem, Jerusalem!
Hark! how the angels sing,
Hosanna in the highest,
Hosanna to your king!""

And once again the scene was chang'd
New earth there seem'd to be,
I saw the holy city
Beside the tideless sea

The light of god was on its streets
The gates were open wide,
And all who would might enter
And no one was denied.

No need of moon or stars by night,
Or sun to shine by day,
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away

Sing for the night is o'er

Left blooming alone
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone

No flow'are of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes 
Or give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stern 
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them

Thus kindly I'll scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow
When friendships decay
And from love's shining circle
The gems drop away

When true hearts lie wither'd
And fond ones are flow'n
Oh! who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?","The Last Rose of Summer, song"

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow

But when ye come and all white flow'rs are crying
If I am dead, as dead I may well be
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ave there for me

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me

Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love;
The love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar, the dearest and the best;
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths arepeace.","I Vow to Thee, My Country"

 To my lullaby surrender
 Warm and tender is my breast
 Mother's arms with love caressing
 Lay their blessing on your rest
 Nothing shall tonight alarm you
 None shall harm you, have no fear
 Lie contented, calmly slumber
 On your mother's breast, my dear

 Here tonight I tightly hold you
 And enfold you while you sleep
 Why, I wonder, are you smiling
 Smiling in your slumber deep?
 Are the angels on you smiling
 And beguiling you with charm
 While you also smile, my blossom
 In my bosom soft and warm?

 Have no fear now, leaves are knocking
 Gently knocking at our door
 Have no fear now, waves are beating
 Gently beating on the shore
 Sleep, my darling, none shall harm you
 Nor alarm you, never cry
 In my bosom sweetly smiling
 And beguiling those on high",Suo Gan
Charlotte Church,"O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
 It is the night of the dear saviour's birth.
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
 For yonder breaks a news and glorious morn,

 Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices.
 O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
 O night divine, O night, O night divine.

 Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
 So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
 Here came the wise men from the Orient land.
 The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
 In all our trials born to be our friend.

 He knows our need, He guardeth us from danger;
 Behold your King, before Him lowly bend!
 Behold you King, before Him lowly bend!

 Fall on your knees! etc.","Cantique de Noël for voice & orchestra ""O Holy Night"""

And the sea is calm
Lonely shadow, you call upon me

Lay by my side
Fear not tonight
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

Dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

Ride with me upon a shining star,
Above the moonlit sky
We will find Elysium

Hear the nightingale
Sing a lullaby
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

Dawn will be kind,
All will be bright,
Lonely shadow, rise from the darkness

Dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

Ride with me upon a shining star,
Above the moonlit sky once more

We'll dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

We'll dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

Charlotte Church,"Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse's lineage coming
As men of old have sung

It came a flow'ret bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night

Isaiah 'twas foretold it
The rose I have in mind
With Mary we behold it
The Virgin Mother kind

To show God's love aright
She bore to men a Saviour
When half spent was the night

O flow'are, whose fragrance tender
With sweetness fills the air
Dispel in glorious splendour
The darkness ev'ry where

True man yet very God
From sin and death now save us
And share our ev'ry load","Es ist ein Ros entsprungen (Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming), for chorus"

On Mary's lap is sleeping?

Where ox and lamb are feeding?

Come, peasant, kin to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn,
This comes to pass when a child is born.

A rosy dawn settles all around

You got to feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This come to pass when a child is born.

It must come true some time soon somehow
