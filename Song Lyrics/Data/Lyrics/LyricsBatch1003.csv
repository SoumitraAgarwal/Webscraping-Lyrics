Marcus Miller,"I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor
I like to do it to you
Till you holla for more
I like to reggae
But you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you
So you can make me scream
Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me
Boogie on reggae woman
Baby can't you see
I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you naked
Under the stars above
Yes I would
I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love - yeah
I'd like to see you in the raw
Under the stars above
So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do 
Can I play? Can I play?
No!
Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do 
Boogie on reggae woman
Let me do it to you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do",Boogie on Reggae Woman

He only knew her 4 a little while, 
But he had grown accustomed 2 her style
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
He did 2, they were meant 2 be
They loved 2 kiss on the steps of versailles
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly
I love u baby, I love u so much, 
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy, 
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

He gave her all the love that anyone can, 
But she was promised 2 another man
He tried so hard not 2 go insane
Birds do fly, looks like rain
I love u baby, I love u so much, 
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy, 
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

Let me keep you near to ease away your fears

Marcus Miller,"Hiding mystery in my head
I avoid the arms that with pleasure
Would welcome my surrender

I can't even trust my eyes

The path I walked is paved with fear
Tunnel with no end
And too winding to understand that all I need is to reach out

For brighter side of the dark
Behind the mask

Hypocrisy
Night is come

Day is done
Once blood has been drawn

There's always a need

Before the curtain of night will fall

With its heaviness
Before the lamp will project a trembling silhouettes
I'll sneak into your head to steal your happiness",Moonlight Sonata
Marcus Miller,"Come let yourself be
Come see the possibilities
Let love take over your pain
And heal to the river of the rain

Girl, come and be still
Free your mind and your body will be well
And keep this melody
Tucked away in your heart for you and me

Oh, yeah, let my love erase your pain
Sun gonna shine, gonna shine again
Then we'll dance in the silver rain
Can you feel it?
(come on and dance in the silver rain)

Tomorrow you'll live your dreams in the sunlight
Can you feel it?

Marcus Miller,"Wait a minute

Everywhere I go
Everyone I know, is searching
For some kind of answer

Stars are shining by
They decorate the night, in gemini
Sagitarious and cancer

Somewhere out there
A mysterious form of light is awaiting
They're gonna save us, make us famous
And we wont have to feel so all alone

Out on the edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
Dropped us off, and left us here
Smoking up the atmosphere

Lots of boys and girls
Living in this world are thinking
We need to go faster

We're picking up the pace
In the human race
We don't worry about disaster

Don't worry babe

Somewhere in there
An important part of our collected brain is missing
Is outrageous, like las vegas
We are all together, but we are all alone

Out on the edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
Dropped us off, left us here
Smoking up, the atmosphere

Please
Can somebody tell me
Where is everybody going

Wait a minute

Somewhere out there
Come on back and save us
Maybe they'll, come on back

We are going to paradise
Welcome to the penitenciary
The ultimate place to live your life
In paradise or misery

Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time

Dropped us off, and left us here

Marcus Roberts,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Marcus Roberts,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Marcus Roberts,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Marcus Roberts,"This town is full of guys who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You can see them every day, strolling up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
You'll see wise guys and boosters,
Card sharps and crap shooters,
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear those flashy ties and collars,
But where they get their dollars,
They've all got an ace down in the hole.

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
That's their ace in the hole.
Others have girls on that old tenderloin,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips they are going to take,
From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,
If they lost that old ace in the hole.

Wherever you might stray, along the Great White Way,
They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.
But every hustler knows
Bullshit buys no clothes
And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,
But all of them have aces in the hole.

Drifters who dwell on that slippery slope,
Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of money they've made and they've spent
And flash a Missouri bankroll.
But their names would be mud,

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

And the priests are burned on stakes

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Infernal Eternal/Towards the Land of the Damned

Aunque se que si te vas me quedo en ná

Y a barrer el querer con los pelos de un pincel

Las noches mal dormidas llegué yo 
Y le llené de flores el jergón para los dos
Sin espinas, de colores, que se rieguen 
Cuando llore y cuando no, las sulfatamos 
Con nuestro sudor
Y me confesó, cuando quieras arrancamos que 
En las líneas de la mano lo leyó
Que se acabó el que la quemara el sol
Pero se asustó, ¡como te retumba el pecho!
Tranqui, solo es mi maltrecho corazón
Que se encabrita cuando oye tu voz

¿Qué coño le pasara que ya no sale a volar? 
¿Tal vez le mojó las plumas el relente de la luna? 
Le volvió loca el sonío de las gotas de rocío 
Cuando empieza a clarear y aún no se ha dormío

Yo seguía siendo nada no importó
Eramos parte del mismo colchón 
Hasta que juró,""nos querremos mas que nadie 
Pa que no corra ni el aire entre tu y yo""
Sentí que me iba faltando el calor

It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",The Long and Winding Road

It's funny how the way 
You make me feel
Boy when you're near me 
I know that it's real
You make me feel warm 
You make me feel safe
Lyin' here with you

It's all that it takes, yeah
It's all that it takes, yeah

I've never felt like this before
Not sure on too much
But I know one thing's for sure
You're nothing short of beautiful

It's funny how the way 
I feel inside
I never want to let you go 
For the rest of my life
There's no more walls around me
No longer have to wait

Verse
Like a flower in the morning turns towards the sun
I'm just hoping and praying that you're the one
Thoughts keep rushing
I see all the possibilities
And I'm down
I'm down on my knees

Chorus
What I won't do for love
What I won't do just because
Please baby put my soul at ease
Are you the one for me
And have you come to set me free
Cause I'm down here
I'm down on my knees

Verse
Like a wave in the ocean comes to the shore
I'll just be wanting you forever more
Anytime you touch me
I get so blind I can't see
And I'm down here
I'm down on my knees

Chorus
What I won't do for love
What I won't do just because
Please baby put my soul at ease
Are you the one for me
And have you come to set me free
Cause I'm down here
I'm down on my knees",Down on My Knees

And Cash leads the choir

You used to smile
But you couldn't find the crowd
It took a while
But you couldn't see it through
What have they done with you.

[Chorus]
So you look at your life
You look at the world
The you look to the oceans
You're looking for that world
A world above the rest
Something to set you free
Then you realize
You need to get out.

So you're swimming around
Well, you're swimming deeper still
They've got you wearing a crown
A crown of steel that's just weighing you down
You need to get away

[Chorus]

Well your father was mad
But he still is your dad
Well you know he was wrong
But you can't carry on
You need to break that cycle now
And rise above the rest
The you can be free

Maren Ord,"Don't close your eyes
They may not open

But not everyone rises
Why don't you get up
And rise again for me

What if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
What if the world 
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes
And blink again for me

What about friendship
What about friends
You said the whole world
Was against you
And it all had to end

What about love
What about family
What about all that

Maren Ord,"You stroll along
Retrace your footsteps
You see a child
He's left alone

Alone to stay
Alone with no one there to play
You recall your childhood
Still lonesome today

All he wanted was a friend
Someone he could talk to
Relate to

You attempt to reach
But then you look away
Nothing's accomplished
Two shadows fade

What to grow as?
What will you grow up to become?
Where are these answers?
Oh they'll come along

All he wanted was a friend
Someone he could talk to
Relate to

You wonder why you're still alone
You cry all night on your roof top
What are you hiding?
Is it something I must know?

How could a young girl feel so old.

He bragged they had no power 
And as they let him make his speech

Everbody needs some love 
You can't shake it, it's in your blood

You can't love until you know the truth 
That there's somebody who has seen love through (so)

You want the romance, you've got the desire

Well, you move on and on and on and on 

When will you learn that it's more than a kiss 
When love has come why do you still resist

A thousand books of stories told
All were black but one was gold

Through drops of salt on every page

And my body was breaking
For the words He was saying

Be a light in the darkness
Be a heart to the heartless
When the world's lost its meaning
Be the one who will still go on believing

Another dream in black and white
A gentle man of flesh and bone
He says this world is not our home

To cut down my point of view
Maybe then I could concentrate

Whether to bow to the temple wall
Or to the spirit locked inside

Tonight I've got my heart
By the throat
I'm gonna stay here
Till my whole body knows

I commit my heart to the heavens
I stand to praise Your name
I commit my heart to the heavens
I am here to praise your name

I say this simply with no regrets
I was born to testify
There's no shame in being Your servant
It's the highest call in life

Still I need to remind myself
That I'm happiest on my knees
When I am thanking You for who You are
And all that You've done for me

Before these words burn a hole
On my tongue
I'm gonna praise You
For all You've done

Margaret Becker,"Grandma sailed the Irish coast
When she was barely thirteen
She was young enough
To believe in her dreams

Working at a sweatshop
Down on Bleeker Street
Staring out the window
She could see Miss Liberty

The price didn't seem too steep

She believed in a nation
She believed in love
She believed in loyalty
And she put her fate in the hands of God

I believed in a nation

I hope, I have the simple faith
The silent strength of the immigrant's daughter

She could not be halted
By famine or disease
She married America
And she scrubbed it on her knees

Fiercely devoted
To who was yet to be
She gladly gave her reverence
To the high authority

And only Your love does this to me

And even as I stand here before You
Still there is a distance I long to close
Lord, I want to run right straight toward You
want to cling like a child to the folds of Your robe
You're my champion, my comfort and my strength
Jesus, I'll tell You again

Only Your love
Does this to me
Lifts me above what I thought I could be

Anchored yet free
And only Your love does this to me

I freely choose to do Your will
'Cause every moment of my life
Is a moment I want You to fill

Margaret Becker,"Hunger stays
Hunger stays
I've been thinking about what I've been through
All the good times, all the bad
And anywhere in between the two
There runs a common thread
Some call it a condition
A hidden chasm that will never fill up
A constant thirst for Your presence
A longing for Your love

[Chorus]
The hunger stays
I keep on reaching
The hunger stays
I keep on seeking
The hunger stays
Through the blessing
Through the bleeding
The hunger stays

I've seen Your rivers in my heart
Seen Your miracles time after time
And when I think I can't take anymore
I see there's so much more to find

[Chorus]

I will seek till I can seek no more
I won't give up until I find You Lord

He just goes where there's bread
And he keeps pressing through

Margaret Becker,"I found a letter I wrote to you
In the bottom of the drawer
Simple words, simple point of view
That I don't have much anymore
It said ""I don't want fortune
I don't want fame
I only want the treasure
That time can't take away""

[Chorus]
Look me in the eye
Tell me if you see
Traces of yourself
Growing here in me
Tell me if you find
Your heart in mine
I pray you'll see your light
When you look me in the eye

Many years have come and gone
Since I wrote that page
And somehow with the passing time
I've let that truth slip away
Dear Lord remind me
Each and every day that your
Holiness, your Godliness
Is all that will remain

[Chorus]

Now I see you
Much too dimly
But someday we'll be
Eye to eye

That you were proud of my life

Center my soul
Till all I do
Is for You alone

Nothing left to lose
It seemed so simple then
When there wasn't a lot to choose

Every day was like a year
There was lots of time
To see things clear
But then the blessing brought me here

Still swinging in Solomon's shoes
Still swinging in Solomon's shoes

Things have changed a lot for me
I don't worry about my rent
I pay it on time, I pick and choose
How every dime gets spent

Guess there's nothing wrong with being blessed
It should be the same
Both more and less
I haven't found the balance yet

Still swinging in Solomon's shoes
Still swinging in Solomon's shoes

Solomon was the wisest man
But I guess not wise enough
He forgot the Blesser
When the blessing were too much

Now I know I swing with Solomon
Between the left and right
How I wish that I could find a place
Where I'd be satisfied

Cannot live while they're within

Coming for my soul
Taking me to places
I wasn't ready yet to go, no no

Last night, I dreamed of silence
The silence that I keep

Well, they stole away my sleep

I need to remember
The horses will come
(I need to remember)
I need to remember
How quickly they run
(I need to remember)

I want no regrets
When the horses come for me
I cannot forget
That the horses come for me

Last night I dreamed You with me
You put Your finger to my lips
And You told me to be brave now
And I felt like I'd been kissed

I need to remember
You're always with me

And I need to remember
You're the reason I breathe

That the horses come for me

When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till he returns or calls me home

Margaret Harris,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Made your heart sad and blue

Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

That you belonged to me

Margaret Whiting,"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by

When leaves begin to die?

You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

In a book that I took from the shelf

A fine romance, my friend, this is.
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes.

I've never mussed a crease in your blue serge pants.
I never had the chance.
This is a fine romance.

You take romance. I'll take Jello.
You calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean.
At least they flap their fins to express emotion.

With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.
This is a fine romance.

True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.
We don't have half the thrills that ""The March of Time"" has.

A fine romance, with no pinches.
You never give the orchids I send a glance.
No, you like cactus plants.

Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away

And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

How through those far-ways
And strange star-ways
On sea or on land

Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow!

Something in your eyes I see

That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

When I awake, I awaken with a tingle

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

That I'm lonely, and low as can be?

Or sing a solo, or row.

As dozens of men that I know.
He isn't tall or straight or slim
And he dresses far worse than Ted or Jim.
And I can't explain why he should be
Just the one, one man in the world for me.

He's just my Bill, an ordinary man,
He hasn't got a thing that I can brag about.
And yet to be
Upon his knee
So comfy and roomy

Margaret Whiting,"Bill collectors gather 'round and rather
Haunt the cottage next door
Men the grocer and butcher sent
Men who call for the rent
But within a happy chappy
And his bride of only a year
Seem to be so cheerful, here's an earful
Of the chatter you hear

every morning, every evening
Ain't we got fun?
Not much money, Oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid dear
We haven't a bus
But smiles were made dear
For people like us

In the winter in the Summer
Don't we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get children
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

Just to make their trouble nearly double
Something happened last night
To their chimney a gray bird came
Mister Stork is his name
And I'll bet two pins, a pair of twins
Just happened in with the bird
Still they're very gay and merry
Just at dawning I heard

every morning, every evening
Don't we have fun
Twins and cares, dear, come in pairs, dear
Don't we have fun
We've only started
As mommer and pop
Are we downhearted
I'll say that we're not

Landlords mad and getting madder
Ain't we got fun?
Times are so bad and getting badder
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get laid off
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

When the man who sold 'em carpets told 'em
He would take them away
They said, ""Wonderful, here's our chance
Take them up and we'll dance""
And when burglars came and robbed them
Taking all their silver, they say
Hubby yelled, ""We're famous, for they'll name us
In the papers today

Night or daytime, it's all playtime
Ain't we got fun?
Hot or cold days, any old days
Ain't we got fun
If Wifey wishes
To go to a play
Don't wash the dishes
Just throw them away

Streetcar seats are awful narrow
Ain't we got fun?
They won't smash up our Pierce Arrow
We ain't got none
They've cut my wages
But my income tax will be so much smaller
When I'm laid off, I'll be paid off

Behold how my lover loves me!""

I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be

To stay old fashioned with me

Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,

Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Que habré dicho? No se 
Y es entonces que entiendo se mide el amor 
Cuando acaba el placer 

Sigues dentro de mi pecho y vivo recordando 
Cuando pienso en ti yo siento que te estoy amando 
Y cuando llega el deseo es tu nombre que llamo 
Puede que no seas tu pero es a ti a quien amo",Cuando Acaba el Placer

Tu es rentré dans ma vie
M'a prise de court
Tu m'as donné l'envie de croire à l'amour
J'ai oublié ce qu'était l'ennuie
Avec tes mots de velours
Tes promesses qui m'obsèdent nuit et jour

Je veux me réveiller chaque matin
Ton corps blotie contre le mien
Je veux mon cœur en tes deux mains
Pour qu'il batte avec le tien

Viens l'air de rien
Te perdre dans mes va et vient

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And people are complaining

Comes to take you
Away from reason

You do not only from need
And not from greed

And live without hurting

	Words and Music by Margo Guryan



Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember
The way it feels to love each other
Just in case of cloudy days to come

See the smile on my face
Take a picture so we can remember
The things you do to make me smile this way

Ask a stranger to take a picture
We should have one side by side
Look at me, and say `I love you'
Aren't I the picture of pride

Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember 
The things we share, the dreams we're dreaming of
Come and take a picture of love

	Words and Music by Margo Guryan




If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain
Think of holding hands and running for cover
Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile

Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me
Think of rain
Think of rain
If one day you should think of leaving me

No demands

Being unkind

Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

I knew the man well
We used to be good friends a long time ago
He had a heart and a mind
He was one of a kind
The kind of a man a man would be lucky to know

But then there came a change
As I recall it all, it all happened fast
It was as though he had seen the American dream
And thought that the dream would bring him fulfillment at last

He put on a suit
He put on a shirt
He put on a tie
He kissed his child
He kissed his wife
He kissed his life good-bye

The last I saw of him
He walked along the road, and he looked around
As though he wanted to see one more blossoming tree
Before he'd be walking on cold city ground

He got to the station
He climbed aboard

	Words and Music by Margo Guryan and Richard Bennett

Melon-rising California sun
Drifting in a day not yet begun
Six o'clock and peaceful and serene
Floating in a Technicolor scene

Something nearly peaceful in the sound
Rising from the San Andreas ground
Overground, it starts to feel strange
Underground, it starts to rearrange

You'd better get up
And run for a doorway

No time for thinking
Your life is at stake
Everyone's doing the California Shake
California Shake

Nonbelieving, everybody waits
Shifting on the continental plates
Thunder far below the ocean floor
Damned impartial sub-terrestrial war

Wond'ring if you're going to survive
God, it feels like eight point four or five
Fifteen seconds holding your breath
Living through a microscopic death

You'd better hold on
The worst isn't over

						Words and Music by Margo Guryan

The heat is down and the lights are low
The East is buried in an icy snow
The West is following crisis rules
They can't go swimming in their swimming pools

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The prices rise and the Market falls
The trucks go slow and the Congress stalls
The V.P. left with the dough he took
And the P. tells the world he's not a crook

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The A.G.* said he'd do anything
To help the President become the King
The kingdom then became cold and empty
All except for San Clemente

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The rich save money and the poor save gas
We vote for an elephant and get an ass
He hires and he fires, he appoints and sacks
But he can't figure out his income tax

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm….

I'd like to see the bad guys win

To get into the trouble they're always in

I'd like to see the bad guys have some fun
They're always getting pushed around
Wouldn't it be thrilling to see
Stories catching up with reality

I'd like to see the good guys giving in
And letting the bad guys win
Sometime
I'd like to see the bad guys win

I'd like to see the bad guy get the girl
The good guy's always such a bore
He's well-behaved, and he's so sincere
But she don't even get what he gives a horse

I'd like to see the bad guys get away
They're always getting shot or hung
Wouldn't it be thrilling to see
A happy ending ending unhappily

I'd like to tell the good guys `it's no sin'
To let the bad guys win
Sometime

Most of my life I fell in love in one minute flat
Falling in love most of my life was as easy as that
And losing someone I loved was part of the game
Until I lost you and found you again

And now it seems I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again
And now it seems I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again

Most of my life I thought that love was only a way
Of killing the time, filling the gap, or spending the day
And then you showed me how beautiful love could be
And for the first time love happened to me

And now I know I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again
And now I know I?ve loved you most of my life

And divil a one shall hear us wid me...

So I came to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
She opened the door and she let me in
And divil a one did hear us wid me...

She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led him to the stable
Saying there's plenty of oats for a soldier's horse
To eat them if he's able wid me...

She took me by the lily white hand
And she led me to the table
Saying there's plenty of wine for a soldier boy
To drink it if he's able wid me...

Then I got up and I made the bed
And I made it nice and aisy
And I picked her up and I laid her down
Saying, lassie, are ye able wid me...

And there we lay till the break of day
And divil a one did hear us
Then I got up and put on me clothes
Saying lassie I must leave you wid me...

And when will you return again
And when will we get married
When broken shells make Christmas bells
Then we might well get married wid me...",As I Roved Out

And still be side by side in love

Margo Price,"When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road
I was fifty-seven dollars from being broke
Kissed my mama and my sisters and I said goodbye
And with my suitcase packed I wiped the tears from my eyes

Times they were tough growing up at home
My daddy lost the farm when I was two years old
Took a job at the prison working second shift
And that’s the last time I let them take what should be his

Cause all I want to do is make a little cash
Cause I worked all the bad jobs bustin' my ass
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
And turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

When I hit the city I joined the band
Started singing in the bars and running with the men
But the men they brought me problems
And the drinking caused me grief
I thought I'd found a friend but I only found a thief

Soon I settled down with a married man
We had a couple babies, started living off the land
But my firstborn died and I cried out to God
Is there anybody out there looking down on me at all?

Cause all I want to do is make something last
But I can't see the future, I can't change the past
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Still I keep a'running fast as I can
Trying to make something honest with my own two hands
And I ain't got the breath to say another bad word
So if I ever said it wrong won't you forget what you heard

Cause all I want to do is make my own path
Cause I know what I am, I know what I have
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine

No darling, I won't speak your name
And I hope that you will do the same
But I hope my voice will haunt you above the ground
If I see your face again don't consider me a friend
You made me feel like an orphan and act like a clown

So I wouldn't have to spend my nights alone, all alone

Spending all my weekends here
Far from my good-timing friends
Things just went from bad to worse
But I don't know when
The only thing I know for sure
Is I ain't going back again

They took me down to cellblock B
After stripping off my clothes
Put me in a monkey suit
And threw me in the throes
Like a rat in a maze
A cow in the herd
Or a sparrow with a broken wing
Now I know the reason why
The caged bird has to sing

'Cause I'm just a weekender
In the Davidson County Jail
And my old man, he ain't got the cash
To even go my bail
Should have listened to my mama
And quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again

This bed is hard and the room is cold
And my cellmate's got a cough
She takes her meds and sleeps all day
Got six more weeks til she's off
She said she beat her boyfriend up
While high on crack cocaine
And now she sits and watches
Her life go down the drain

Picked a fight with the man at the desk
Mighty soon was sent back to her room
And I bet you know the rest

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

She wants to get real fucked up. 
She used to laugh and smile, 
But the years of denial. 
Have taken their toll on her dial. 

But, me, I do as I please. 
I caught you and set you free. 
Cause I have been left alone by the people I've known. 
And I don't know when they're coming home. 

And Jen don't wanna be seen, 
But I saw her in a swank magazine. 
She had an airbrushed face, 
But the lines of distaste 
were crossed without crossing of legs. 

And I don't wanna be found. 
So when you get home, 
I'm skipping town. 
I'm leaving to go someplace 
where nobody will have any clue where I am.

And watched the sun glide over the hill.

I just said the first 
Three words that popped into my head.
Let me off the bus; I'm tired and soar and should probably change clothes.
And the circuits are blown, 
My woman is cold,
Our children are stoned and worthless.
All waiting for you to tell them the truth. The truth is a line, that you'll never use.

And her dignity 
Shown so bright like a light on a hill.
And she burned for me, 
And no other man came near the flame.
And back country songs the deafening twang of the rich-white-kid blues
You can own the stage, 
But the lights and glares will not make you real.

I bread my misery and drowned it in her.

I want to ask you, will you run, runaway with me
I'll look after you, oh baby, baby can't you see

Will you run, runaway with me
And leave your world behind
Will you come, come and stay with me
Just you and me until the end of time

But I miss you now my friend
I long to kiss your smile again

Will you run, runaway with me
And leave your world behind
Will you come, come and stay with me
Just you and me until the end of time",Runaway

Mari Wilson,"When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die

Maria,"Why don't you say, what's on your mind
Stop playing games, and wasting my time
'Cause we both know that for far too long
We've tried to hide that something still is going on

I still feel you when you're gone
Should I still want you if it's wrong
'Cause though I've tried, baby, my heart won't be
Can't fight what I feel

So no matter what I say,
And no matter what I do
And no matter who I love, I'm always loving you
Always, can't help myself, always, always, baby

Let's find a way, to make this last
You be my future, not just my past
'Cause it might be right, when it feels so strong
Help me find out, what the hell is going

If you promise me, you'll be loving me, exclusively
Baby, you will see, we've got endless possibilities
You can trust me baby, if I can trust you, baby",Always
Maria,"I thought you know mw well enough that you could tell
That just one thing will do when I'm in this mood
And what I'm craving is, you flavor on my lips
So won't you fill me up, 'cause I've waited for this

All day long it's on my mind
There's no way to unwind
Until I get back home, and you put it on

I like my coffee in bed
It only takes one sip to go to my head
I never have to say no sugar or cream, baby
'Cause you know what I need, my black coffee

Now if I seem selfish, it's 'cause I can't resist
Even though I've tried, I still crave I crave that high
And yeah, it's obvious that I can't get enough
So if you serve it hot, I'll say when to stop

I don't want a drop to be wasted
So just slow down and take your time
'Cause you know what I like",Coffee in Bed
Maria,"I still believe that if you and I
Could turn the clocks back, we'd realize
That what we have has gone from worse to bad
It's clear, things are not what they appear
Tell me what happened to butterflies
I used to get them, when you'd walk by
And I'd just have to touch you
To know that you were mine, ain't it funny how time flies

I hate to love you, but I get the feeling
When I'm thinking of you, it's crazy but true
I hate to love you, but I keep believing
It's the way to you, like I do

I keep on choosing to never learn
Can't win for losing so I return
To what I know, and even though
I pray for change, same old story, same old game
There's no denying that we both tried
But what good is trying, if every time
We breakup to makeup
I'm tired of the trend, I feel it coming 'round again

How many times will I say goodbye
How many tears so I have to cry
How many wrongs will it take to make it right
Baby, I wonder why",Hate to Love You
Maria,"If you cut, I will bleed
Bring me down to my knees
Make me feel what I am is never good enough
Can you help me understand
Thought I made you a better man
Guess somehow another way things just change

It seems just like a distant memory
That you used to be good for me
But baby now it's clear

I give, you take
Somehow it's gonna break
I pray for the strength 
I hate to say I know it can't go on this way
I give, you take
I know we're gonna break
And it hurts my soul
I hate to say we can't go on this way

With your words, you pull me in
I always lose I just can't win
And though I see, my heart is blind it gives in every time
You got me on constant repeat I need a cure or a remedy
'cause if I stay there won't be nothing left for me

It seems just like a distant memory
That you used to be good for me
But now it's clear

I give, you take
Somehow it's gonna break
I pray for the strength 
I hate to say I know it can't go on this way
I give, you take
I know we're gonna break
And it hurts my soul
I hate to say we can't go on this way

Now there's nothing left for us to save
And only bitterness remains
What we have is like a house of cards
And it's falling apart
Now it's impossible to get it back with the bridges that you've burned
I guess it's time to walk away
'Cause now it's so clear

Chorus until end","I Give, You Take"
Maria,"Temporarily, I lost my mind, but it feels alright
When you're here with me, I get so high
I taste you on my lips, and you begin, to get under my skin
You know I can't resist, letting you in

Right where I want to be
With you inside of me
And I can't hardly breath

'Cause you're so intoxicating, I'm loving everything you do
Constantly you've got me craving, I can't get enough of you
'Cause you're so intoxicating, I'm loving everything you do
Constantly you've got me craving, just another hit of you

I'm surrendering, and you can tell that I'm about to melt
Better than a dream, I lost myself, now I'm in so deep like a breeze
You come over me, if I had the strength to speak
I'd whisper to you softly, that I'm

Feels like I'm falling from the sky
But when I am with you, I can fly
And in that moment, it happens again
Don't know where you end and I begin",Intoxicated
Maria,"I've been alone, since the day that you left me
'Cause i never told, just what you mean to me
I guess I'm afraid, of those kind of feelings
Didn't mean to push you away, i realize i made a big mistake

'cause you know i know, and i know you know
That every time you do, i get so lonely
I know you know, and you know i know
That every time you go, i get so lonely

Never fely this way, 'til you came into my life
And you made me feel, something that i thought i'd never like
Deep down you know, that you're everything i need
So why pretend, that you don't know its hurting me, 'cause

Tell me what it takes to make you come back home
Tell me what i have to say, 'cause i don't like being alone
Yes, you're everything i want, you're the better part of me

You know I'm really missing you baby, uh huh, yeah

Longing for you everyday and I reach for you every night (uh huh, yeah)
Baby nothing's been the same since the day, we, said, good-bye
And I can't go on like this for too long
Baby baby I'm missing you (uh huh, yeah)
Boy I need you next to me and I'm hungering for your touch
Caught up in the memories and you're all I'm thinking of (uh huh, yeah)
'Cause I can't get past, what we used to have (yeah)
Baby baby I'm missing you (come on)

I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby won't you come here 'cause I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't want to be with nobody else

Can't recover from your kiss because nothing, else compares (uh huh, yeah)

We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you

Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what (uh huh, yeah)
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up

Past hot, we was more like lava-ble (uh huh)
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)

When I thought you was able to cope
that's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy

It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Maria Anadon,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Maria Arredondo,"Ooooh

Only had a little taste
But I remember how it felt
And all the phonecalls late at night
Though we tried, we couldn't make it right

When the seasons changed
Everything got colder
Everyone could hear, our illusion crush
It was all we had

[chorus]
So every minute that I've spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

when we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So....
Brief and beautiful
So....

[verse]
When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could

make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I'm movin'on
But I won't forget
All that is unsaid

[chorus]

it was so short(?)
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It's not yours to keep

oh, things fades away
And now its gone

[chorus]x2
",Brief and Beautiful
Maria Arredondo,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips 
And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night 
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",Sound of Music
Maria Augusta,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Maria Augusta,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Maria Bestar,"Hace dos meses q' no somos nada
Hace una vida q' vivo por ti
Si sueño es solo con tu mirada
Si despierto es por q' no estas aquí
Me pregunto q' pieza nos falto
No terminamos el puzzle del amor
No funciono y te niegas a aceptarlo
Y yo q' entiendo no encuentro el valor

Como consigo olvidarte del todo
Como te saco de aquí
Pensando en ti me paso noche y día
Me gana la batalla, la melancolía
Pensando en ti no encuentro la salida
Ensayos destruidos y aun sigo viva
Pensando en ti lamento miles de faltas
Extraño tu sonrisa me mata el alma
Pensando en ti, en q' ya no hay nada
Escojo mis recuerdos aferrada a la almohada
Pensando en ti, yo sigo pensando en ti,
Yo sigo pensando en ti, yo sigo pensando en ti

Como seguir si no es de tu mano
Como aceptar q' nadie es un extraño
Y aun q' se q' no puedo funcionar
No es suficiente pa' poder olvidarte",Pensando en Ti

Maria Bethânia,"Chega de tentar, dissimular e disfarçar e esconder
O que não dá mais pra ocultar
E eu não posso mais calar
Já que o brilho desse olhar foi traidor
E entregou o que você tentou conter
O que você não quis desabafar
E me cortou

Chega de temer, chorar, sofrer, sorrir, se dar
E se perder
E se achar
E tudo aquilo que é viver
Eu quero mais é me abrir
E que essa vida entre assim
Como se fosse o sol
Desvirginando a madrugada
Quero sentir a dor dessa manhã

Nascendo, rompendo, rasgando, tomando meu corpo e então
Eu chorando, sofrendo, gostando, adorando, gritando
Feito louca, alucinada e criança
Sentindo o meu amor se derramando
Não dá mais pra segurar
Explode coração
",Explode Coração
Maria Bethânia,"Eu sou a chuva que lança a areia do Saara
Sobre os automóveis de Roma
Eu sou a sereia que dança
A destemida Iara
Água e folha da Amazônia
Eu sou a sombra da voz da matriarca da Roma Negra
Você não me pega
Você nem chega a me ver
Meu som te cega, careta, quem é você?
Que não sentiu o suingue de Henri Salvador
Que não seguiu o Olodum balançando o Pelô
E que não riu com a risada de Andy Warhol
Que não, que não e nem disse que não

Eu sou um preto norte-americano forte
Com um brinco de ouro na orelha
Eu sou a flor da primeira música
A mais velha
A mais nova espada e seu corte
Sou o cheiro dos livros desesperados
Sou Gitá Gogóia
Seu olho me olha mas não me pode alcançar
Não tenho escolha, careta, vou descartar
Quem não rezou a novena de Dona Canô
Quem não seguiu o mendigo Joãozinho Beija-Flor
Quem não amou a elegância sutil de Bobô
Quem não é Recôncavo e nem pode ser reconvexo",Reconvexo
Maria Bethânia,"Hoje eu ouço as canções que você fez pra mim
Não sei por que razão tudo mudou assim
Ficaram as canções e você não ficou
Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais

É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver
O que ainda existe
Pois sem você meu mundo é diferente
Minha alegria é triste
Quantas vezes você disse que me amava tanto
Quantas vezes eu enxuguei o seu pranto
E agora eu choro só sem ter você aqui

Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais
É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver
O que ainda existe
Pois sem você meu mundo é diferente
Minha alegria é triste

Quantas vezes você disse que me amava tanto
Quantas vezes eu enxuguei o seu pranto
E agora eu choro só sem ter você aqui",As Canções Que Você Fez Pra Mim
Maria Bethânia,"Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver

Detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois
São coisas muito grandes pra esquecer
E a toda hora vão estar presentes
Você vai ver

Se um outro cabeludo aparecer na sua rua
E isto lhe trouxer saudades minhas
A culpa é sua

O ronco barulhento do seu carro
A velha calça desbotada ou coisa assim
Imediatamente você vai lembrar de mim

Eu sei que um outro deve estar falando ao seu ouvido
Palavras de amor como eu falei, mas eu duvido!
Duvido que ele tenha tanto amor
E até os erros do meu português ruim
E nessa hora você vai lembrar de mim

A noite envolvida no silêncio
Do seu quarto
Antes de dormir você procura
O meu retrato
Mas da moldura não sou eu quem lhe sorri
Mas você vê o meu sorriso mesmo assim
E tudo isso vai fazer você lembrar de mim

Se alguém tocar seu corpo como eu
Não diga nada
Não vá dizer meu nome sem querer
À pessoa errada

Pensando ter amor nesse momento
Desesperada você tenta até o fim
E até nesse momento você vai
Lembrar de mim

Eu sei que esses detalhes vão sumir
Na longa estrada
Do tempo que transforma todo amor
Em quase nada

Mas ""quase"" também é mais um detalhe
Um grande amor não vai morrer assim
Por isso, de vez em quando você vai
Vai lembrar de mim

Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver
Não, não adianta nem tentar
Me esquecer

No ganas al intentar el olvidarme 
Durante mucho tiempo en tu vida yo voy a vivir 
Detalles tan pequeños de los dos 
Son cosas muy grandes para olvidar 
Y a toda hora van a estar presentes, ya lo verás 

Si otro hombre apareciera por tu ruta 
Y esto te trajese recuerdos míos, la culpa es tuya 
El ruido enloquecedor de su auto 
Sera la causa obligada o algo así 
Inmediatamente tu vas a acordarte de mi 

Yo se que otro debe estar hablando a tu oído 
Palabras de amor como yo te hable, mas yo dudo 
Yo dudo que el tenga tanto amor 
Y hasta la forma de mi decir 
Y en esa hora tu vas a acordarte de mi 

En la noche envuelta en el silencio de tu cuarto 
Antes de dormir tu buscas mi retrato 
Pero aun cuando no quisieras verme sonreír 
Tu ves mi sonrisa lo mismo así 
Y todo eso va a hacer que tu te acuerdes de mi 

Si alguien tocase tu cuerpo como yo no digas nada 
No vayas a decir mi nombre sin querer 
A la persona errada 
Pensando en el amor de ese momento 
Desesperada intentar llegar al fin 

Y hasta en ese momento tu iras a acordarte de mi 
Yo se que mientras existamos recordaremos 
Y que el tiempo transforma todo amor en casi nada 
Mas casi yo me olvido de un gran detalle 
Un gran amor no va a morir así 
Por eso de vez en cuando tu vas a acordarte de mi",Detalhes

Maria Bethânia,"Olha, lá vai passando a procissão 
Se arrastando que nem cobra pelo chão 
As pessoas que nela vão passando 
Acreditam nas coisas lá do céu 
As mulheres cantando, tiram versos 
Os homens escutando, tiram o chapéu 
Ellis vivem penando aqui na terra 
Esperando o que Jesus prometeu 

E Jesus prometeu vida melhor 
Pra quem vive nesse mundo sem amor 
Só depois de entregar o corpo ao chão 
Só depois de morrer neste sertão 
Eu também tô do lado de Jesus 
Só que acho que ele se esqueceu 
De dizer que na terra a gente tem 
De arranjar um jeitinho pra viver 

Muita gente se arvora a ser Deus 
E promete tanta coisa pro sertão 
Que vai dar um vestido pra Maria 
E promete um roçado pro João 
Entra ano, sai ano, e nada vem

Mas se existe Jesus no firmamento 
Cá na terra isto tem que se acabar",Procissao

Sim, e de tua glória

Cavo a direita claridade do céu
E agarro o sol com a mão
É meio-dia, é meia-noite, é toda hora

Lambe olhos, torce cabelos, feiticeira vamo-nos embora
É meio-dia, é meia-noite, faz zumzum na testa
Na janela, na fresta da telha
Pela escada, pela porta, pela estrada toda a fora

Anima de vida o seio da floresta

Vai buscar que mora longe

Vai mostrar esta saudade

Sinto o canto da noite
Na boca do vento

Fazer a dança das flores
No meu pensamento
Traz a pureza de um samba
Sentido, marcado de mágoas de amor

Um samba que mexe o corpo da gente
E o vento vadio embalando a flor

Maria Bethânia,"E aí eu comecei a cometer loucura
Era um verdadeiro inferno, uma tortura
O que eu sofria por aquele amor
Milhões de diabinhos me martelando
Meu pobre coração que agonizando
Já não podia mais de tanta dor

E aí eu comecei a cantar verso triste
O mesmo verso que até hoje existe
Na boca triste de algum sofredor
Como é que existe alguém
Que ainda tem coragem de dizer
Que os meus versos não contêm mensagem
São palavras frias, sem nenhum valor

Oh! Deus, será que o senhor não está vendo isto
Então por que é que o senhor mandou Cristo
Aqui na Terra semear amor
Quando se tem alguém que ama de verdade
Serve de riso pra humanidade
É um covarde, um fraco, um sonhador

Se é que hoje tudo está tão diferente
Por que não deixa eu mostrar a essa gente
Que ainda existe o verdadeiro amor
Faça ela voltar de novo pra o meu lado
Eu me sujeito a ser sacrificado
Salve seu mundo com a minha dor",Loucura

De um ano dourado

Que quando me beija 
A minha pele acobreia 
Minha alma chora 

Flor mestiça 
Que não tem receio 
Em ser brasiliana 
Quando aflora 

Bendito 
Aquele que semeia 
Verdes a mão cheia 
E diz a flor floreia 

Quem vê aquela casa de caboclo 
Feita de palha e reboco 
Que a mata beija e abraça 

Como pode saber? 
Olhando assim lá de fora 
Que dentro desse rancho mora 
A mais bela flor da raça 

Falo da Rosa 
Que quando me beija 
A minha pele acobreia 
Minha alma chora 

Flor mestiça 
Que não tem receio 
Em ser brasiliana 
Quando aflora

Maria Bethânia,"Céu, tão grande é o céu
E bando de nuvens que passam ligeiras
Pra onde elas vão, ah, eu não sei, não sei

E o vento que fala nas folhas
Contando as histórias que são de ninguém
Mas que são minhas e de você também

Ah, Dindi
Se soubesses do bem que eu te quero
O mundo seria, Dindi, tudo Dindi, lindo Dindi

Ai, Dindi
Se um dia você for embora
Me leva contigo, Dindi
Fica, Dindi, olha Dindi

E as águas desse rio
Onde vão, eu não sei
E a minha vida inteira, esperei
Esperei por você, Dindi

Que é a coisa mais linda que existe
Você não existe, Dindi
Deixa Dindi que eu te adore Dindi",Dindi [*]

Só falta você se deitar
Não me falta o sol da manhã
Só falta você acordar

Pra as janelas se abrirem pra mim
O vento brincar no quintal
Embalando as flores no jardim
Balançando as cores no varal

A casa é sua
Por que não chega agora?
Até o teto tá de ponta-cabeça porque você demora

A casa é sua
Por que não chega logo?
Nem o prego aguenta mais o peso desse relógio

Não me falta banheiro, quarto
Abajur, sala de jantar
Não me falta cozinha
Só falta a campainha tocar

Não me falta cachorro
Uivando só porque você não está
Parece até que tá pedindo socorro
Como tudo aqui nesse lugar

Não me falta casa
Só falta ela ser um lar
Não me falta o tempo que passa
Só não dá mais para tanto esperar

Para os pássaros voltarem a cantar
E a nuvem a desenhar um coração flechado
Para o chão voltar a se deitar
E a chuva batucar no telhado

A casa é sua
Por que não chega agora?
Até o teto tá de ponta-cabeça porque você demora

A casa é sua
Por que não chega logo?

A dama de lilás me machucando o coração
A febre de sentir seu corpo inteiro coladinho ao meu

E então eu cantaria a noite inteira 
Como eu já cantei e cantarei
As coisas todas que já tive, tenho e sei que um dia terei
A fé no que virá a alegria de poder olhar pra trás
E ver que voltaria com você de novo a viver nesse imenso salão

E eleva em nuvens de poeira

Me faz sempre ser o que sou e fui
E eu quero, quero, quero, quero ser sim
Esse serafim de procissão do interior
Com as asas de isopor
E as sandálias gastas como gestos do pastor

Presa do dom que Deus me pôs
Sei que é ele a mim que me liberta
Sopra a vida quando as horas mortas
Homens e mulheres vêm sofrer de alegria
Gim, fumaça, dor, microfonia
E ainda me faz ser o que sem ele não seria
E eu quero, quero, é claro que sim
Iluminar o escuro com meu bustiê carmim
Mesmo quando choro
E adivinho que é esse o meu fim

Plena do dom que Deus me deu
Sei que é ele a mim que me ausenta
E quando nada do que eu sou canta
E o silêncio cava grotas tão profundas
Pois mesmo aí na pedra ainda
Ele me faz ser o que em mim nunca se finda
E eu quero, quero, quero ser sim

O oco do bambu
Apito do acaso a flauta da imensidão

Maria Bethânia,"Às vezes você me pergunta
Por que é que eu sou tão calado

Nem fico sorrindo ao teu lado

Você pensa em mim toda hora
Me come, me cospe, me deixa
Talvez você não entenda
Hoje eu vou lhe mostrar

Eu sou a luz das estrelas
Eu sou a cor do luar
Eu sou as coisas da vida
Eu sou o medo de amar

Sou o medo do fraco
A força da imaginação
O blefe do jogador
Eu sou, eu fui, eu vou

Sou o seu sacrifício

O sangue no olhar do vampiro

sou a beira do abismo

saiba que eu estou em você
Mas você não está em mim

A letra a tem seu nome
Dos sonhos eu sou o amor

sou a dona de casa

Sou raso, largo, profundo

Eu sou a mosca da sopa
E o dente do tubarão

Ameniza a dor do mundo",Voz de Mágoa

Pode ser, que eu enlouqueça

Do porta-retrato
Que jogou na parede

Marcas pelo chão, desse furacão
Que me fez voltar atrás
Várias vezes
Desistir de nós
Já ouvi demais
Abaixa o tom de voz
Quero a minha paz

Só um novo amor
É capaz de juntar meus cacos
É chuva de medo
Por todos os lados
Só um novo amor
É capaz de reacender o sol

Só um novo amor
É capaz de juntar meus cacos
É chuva de medo
Por todos os lados
Só um novo amor
É capaz de reacender o sol

If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?

A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira

Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar

Se quiser ser somente minha 
Exatamente essa coisinha, essa coisa toda minha 
Que ninguém mais pode ser 
Você tem que me fazer um juramento 
De só ter um pensamento, ser só minha até morrer 
E também de não perder esse jeitinho de falar devagarinho 
Essas histórias de você 
E de repente me fazer muito carinho 
E chorar bem de mansinho sem ninguém saber porquê 
E se mais do que minha namorada 
Você quer ser minha amada, minha amada, mas amada pra valer 
Aquela amada pelo amor predestinada 
Sem a qual a vida é nada, sem a qual se quer morrer 
Você tem que vir comigo em meu caminho 
E talvez o meu caminho seja triste pra você

Os seus braços o meu ninho no silêncio de depois 
E você tem que ser a estrela derradeira

E podem mesmo falar mal, ficar de mal que não faz mal

Podem preparar milhões de festas ao luar
Que eu não vou ir, melhor nem pedir, que eu não vou ir, não quero ir
E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu

Maria de Angelis,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Maria de Angelis,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Maria Dolores Pradera,"En un rincón del alma 
Donde tengo la pena 
Que me dejo tu adiós, 
En un rincón del alma 
Se aburre aquél poema 
Que nuestro amor creo 
En un rincón del alma 
Me falta tu presencia 
Que el tiempo me robó, 
Tu cara, tus cabellos 
Que tantas noches nuestras 
Mi mano acaricio 

En un rincón del alma 
Me duelen los ""Te quiero"" 
Que tu pasión me dio, 
Seremos muy felices 
No te dejaré nunca 
Siempre serás mi amor 

En un rincón del alma 
También guardo el fracaso 
Que el tiempo me brindo, 
Lo condeno en silencio 
A buscar un consuelo 
Para mi corazón 

Me parece mentira, 
Después de haber querido 
Como he querido yo, 
Me parece mentira 
Encontrarme tan solo 
Como me encuentro hoy, 
De que sirve la vida 
Si a un poco de alegrí­a, 
Le sigue un gran dolor 
Me parece mentira 
Que tampoco esta noche 
Escucharé tu voz 

En un rincón del alma 
Donde tengo la pena 
Que me dejo tu adiós, 
En un rincón del alma 
Se aburre aquél poema 
Que nuestro amor creó 

Con las cosas más bellas 
Guardaré tu recuerdo 
Que el tiempo no logró, 
Sacarlo de mi alma, 
Lo guardaré hasta el dí­a 
En que me vaya yo",En un Rinc贸n del Alma
Maria Dolores Pradera,"Amanecí otra vez
Entre tus brazos
Y desperté llorando
De alegría

Me cobije la cara
Con tus manos
Para seguirte amando
Todavía

Te despertaste tu
Casi dormido
Tu me querías decir
No se que cosa

Pero calle tu boca
Con mis besos
Y así pasaron muchas
Muchas horas

Cuando llego la noche
Apareció la luna
Y entro por la ventana
Que cosa mas bonita
Cuando la luz del cielo
Ilumino tu cara

Yo me volví a esconder
Entre tus brazos
Tu me querías decir
No se que cosa

Pero calle tu boca
Con mis besos
Y así pasaron muchas
Muchas horas

Cuando llego la noche
Apareció la luna
Y entro por la ventana
Que cosa mas bonita
Cuando la luz del cielo
Ilumino tu cara

Yo me volví a esconder
Entre tus brazos
Tu me querías decir

No es como para morir
Pero desecha ya la mas bella ilusión
A nadie ya en el mundo daré mi corazon

Devuélveme  mi amor para  matarlo
Devuélveme el cariño que te di
Tu no eres quien merece conservarlo
Tu ya no vales nada para mi

Devuélveme el rosario de mi madre
Y quédate con todo lo demás
Lo tuyo te lo envió cualquier tarde
No quiero que me veas nunca mas

Hay amores que su llama sigue viva

Me arrimé a tu puerto a descansar
Que tu amor, amor, sólo el que un día 
En tu pecho, vida mía, me dio la felicidad

Hay amores que jamás se nos olvidan
Los que dan toda ternura y fantasía 
Son amores de los buenos como tú

No pretendas que sea poco mi penar

Maria Gadú,"Meu bem que hoje me pede pra apagar a luz
E pôs meu frágil coração na cruz
No teu penoso altar particular

Sei lá, a tua ausência me causou o caos
No breu de hoje eu sinto que o tempo da cura tornou a tristeza normal

E então, tu tome tento com meu coração
Não deixe ele vir na solidão
Encabulado por voltar a sós

Depois, que o que é confuso te deixar sorrir
Tu me devolva o que tirou daqui
Que o meu peito se abre e desata os nós

Se enfim, você um dia resolver mudar
Tirar meu pobre coração do altar
Me devolver, como se deve ser

Ou então, dizer que dele resolveu cuidar
Tirar da cruz e o canonizar
Digo faço melhor do que lhe parecer

Teu cais deve ficar em algum lugar assim
Tão longe quanto eu possa ver de mim
Onde ancoraste teu veleiro em flor

Sem mais, a vida vai passando no vazio

Maria Gadú,"Como num romance
O homem dos meus sonhos
Me apareceu no dancing
Era mais um
Só que num relance
Os seus olhos me chuparam
Feito um zoom
Ele me comia
Com aqueles olhos
De comer fotografia
Eu disse cheese
E de close em close
Fui perdendo a pose
E até sorri, feliz

E voltou
Me ofereceu um drinque
Me chamou de anjo azul
Minha visão
Foi desde então ficando flow

Como no cinema
Me mandava às vezes
Uma rosa e um poema
Foco de luz
Eu, feito uma gema
Me desmilingüindo toda
Ao som do blues
Abusou do Scotch
Disse que meu corpo
Era só dele aquela noite
Eu disse please
Xale no decote
Disparei com as faces
Rubras e febris

E voltou
No derradeiro show
Com dez poemas e um buquê
Eu disse adeus
Já vou com os meus
Pr'uma turnê
Como amar esposa
Disse que agora
Só me amava como esposa
Não como star
Me amassou as rosas
Me queimou as fotos
Me beijou no altar
Nunca mais romance
Nunca mais cinema
Nunca mais drinque no dancing
Nunca mais cheese
Nunca uma espelunca
Uma rosa nunca
Nunca mais feliz

Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-la
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs cœurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
D'un ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est paraît-il
Des terres brulées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai la
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et a t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas.",Ne Me Quitte Pas

And the motor that was runnin' was the mind of you 
I was scared when I looked at my reflection and the shine I saw were the eyes of you 
I was scared when you touched my lips 
And the breath I took was a breath that shook me with a shock 
Like a flame as eternal as a song and the song is you and I 
I will let you breathe through me 
I will let you be with me 

Whenever I'm alone and you're lost out there 
I can feel you breathe ‘cause our lungs we share 
Whenever I'm alone anytime anywhere 
I can feel your heart beat ‘cause our blood we share 

I was scared when you came into my room 
The walls became the sea, your voice was the moon 
Oh when you rocked me in your arms 
Like a song, a wave on the tide of you and I 
I will let you breathe through me 
I will let you be with me 

My heart beats your blood 
Your breath fills my lungs 
Your heart beats my blood 
My breath fills your lungs

The walls became the sea, your voice was the moon 
Oh when you rocked me in your arms

Maria Helena Viana,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Maria Helena Viana,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Maria Ilinca Bacila,"Hey
All you out there
Wanna sing and shout

Yodeleeii, yodeleioo (sing it so I can hear you)
Yodeleeii (yodele, yodeleioo) yodeleioo

Yeah, you never show the spark that makes you glow
You always run away, you always say no to the right things
Don’t try to hide the light inside of you
Today might be the day when you will make it, baby

So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me I will teach you

If you never try, you’ll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride

(Gonna act real craz) yodeleeii
(Yodele yodeleioo) yodeleio

Now what’s the use of being so confused
Of doing all this work you really don’t want to be doing
But you’ll be fine, it’s time to feel alive
Don’t stop from reaching for the stars and keep on moving

So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me, I will teach ya
If you never try, you’ll never be alive

Sitting alone at my desk on a 9 to 5 program, it just won’t do
Get another coffee, get another one to make it through
Don’t want this anymore

Don’t you hide that light inside of you
Come and show me what you wanna do
If you’re stuck in a place feeling incomplete
If you wanna run feeling like a misfit
Come on sing along
Come on sing this song
Say one, two, three

Yodelei, le le le, le le le, yodeleio
Just shout it, baby
Yodelei, le le le, le le le, yodeleio
Just shout it, baby

Wanna hear this now

Gonna act really crazy

Ya lo ves, que no hay dos sin tres
Que la vida va y viene y que no se detiene
Y, qué sé yo
Pero miénteme aunque sea, dime que algo queda
Entre nosotros dos, que en tu habitación
Nunca sale el sol, ni existe el tiempo ni el dolor
Llévame  si quieres a perder
A ningún destino, sin ningún por qué

Ya lo sé, que corazón que no ve
Es corazón que no siente
O corazón que te miente amor
Pero, sabes que en lo más profundo de mi alma
Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?
Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herido
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo con el corazón partió

¿Quién me va a entregar sus emociones?
¿Quién me va a pedir que nunca le abandone?
¿Quién me tapará esta noche si haré frío?
¿Quién me va a curar el corazón partió?

Maria João,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

Un beso y a la fuerza queda

Queda un gesto amable
Para no hacer la vida insoportable
Y así ahogar las penas

Brillaba transparente bajo el sol 

Hubo luego aquella tormenta cruel

A la luz de un rayo se abrió a mis pies 
El abismo de su corazón 
Entonces pude verlo tal cual era
Y lo que descubrí me destrozó

Pagó por mi amor 
Con piedras
Rompió mi ilusión

Que este cuento creyó realidad

Dejar de sufrir por amor
No sé que hacer,

Amarte a ti es sufrir
Pero es que soy feliz por ti
Es que el amor no lo entiendo
Es incierto, no sé lo que siento
Es muy difícil amar

Desde que te conocí,
No me pude resistir,
Yo no sé si tú sientes como yo,
No sé,

La ruleta del amor,
La dirige el corazón,
No me importas tú,
No le importo yo,
Son cosas del amor,

Cómo decir que no,
A lo que siento yo por ti,
Cómo escaparme,  Evitarte,
Dejar de sufrir por amor, no sé,
Dime ¿cómo?, ¿cómo?

No entiendo, que será de mi,
Contigo quiero ser feliz,
Que difícil se hace amarte,
Nunca me ha pasado antes,
Yo te he amado como a nadie

Cómo decir que no,
A lo que siento yo por ti,
Cómo escaparme, evitarte,
Dejar de sufrir,
Del amor por ti,
Cómo,
Amarte a ti es sufrir,
Pero es que soy feliz por ti,
Cómo decir que no,
Cómo decir que no,
Cuando hay amor.",Cómo Decir Que No

Maria José,"Hay una historia que nadie sabe
Pero esta vez voy a contar
Solté la sopa entre otras cosas
Con un intento de galán
Porque mi novio siempre estaba ocupado
Y me aburría cuando estaba aquí a mi lado
Entonces fui con un amigo por quererme desahogar

Muy insistente de que, en su casa
Prepararía para mí
Un rico postre para alegrarme
Me convenció de ir ahí
Y sabiendo que no puedo resistirme
Mañosamente el trato de desvestirme
Y yo que soy muy educada no le pude
Decir que no

Hombre malvado
Que a su pecado me arrastro
No había ni un postre
Con el antojo me dejo

Callo la noche
Me fui a mi casa
Pensando en lo que sucedió
Llego mi novio
Con muchas ganas
Y yo agotada dije no

Porque esa tarde la pase con mis amigas
Que me llevaran a comprarme zapatillas
Me di la vuelta y me hice la dormida
Y hasta fingí que no sentía sus caricias
Decepcionado se metió a las cobijas
Y se durmió

Esa es la historia

Que el amor también esconde fecha de caducidad

Que ya te perdí y que ya se te hace tarde

Que conmigo estaba tú lugar
Y me dejaste atrás
Parece imposible dejarte de amar

Prometiste que no dolería
Que la herida pronto iba sanar
Y aquí todo sigue igual
No sé cómo olvidar que ya no volverás
Prometiste tanto y nada fue verdad

Es mentira que después el tiempo todo curara
Por qué avanza el reloj y no te dejo de pensar
No lo vi venir por qué no me enseñaste
A seguir sin ti y vivir sin extrañarte

¿Quién es?

Soy yo
¿Qué vienes a buscar?
A ti
Y es tarde
¿Por qué?

Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

De un mundo de sensaciones que no encontré
Y al descubrir que era todo una gran fantasía volví
Porque entendí que quería las cosas que viven en ti

Always feeling you
Were there
And all my life
I have searched for you
Everywhere
I caught your smile
In the morning sun
I heard your whisper
On the breeze of night
I prayed one day
That your arms would hold me tight
And just when I
Thought love had passed me by
We met
That first look
In your eyes
I can't forget
You melted me
With your tender touch
I felt all fear and sorrow
Slip away

As I give to you

That nothing in this world
Shall keep us apart

And the wind that follows after
For one certain face
And an unforgotten laughter
I've been following signs
I've been searching through the lands
For a certain pair of arms 
And a certain pair of hands
Yes, I tried a kiss here
And I tried a kiss there
For when you're out in company
The boys and girls will pair
But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
An occasional sunset reminded me
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree
Or one red star hung low in the west
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest
Made me think for a moment
Maybe its true
I found him in the star
In the call 
In the blue
But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
Anywhere, anywhere you",It Never Was You

said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy

and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Maria Kesselman,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind

Don't be scared it's only change
You're near the bottom almost here
Through the pain and through the tears
Learn to face the throws of love
Choose one who be worthy of
All you are, heart and soul
Take him with you where you go

Counting your own blessings
Learning your own lessons
Go where the light begins

Maria Lawson,"Truth is beauty,
Never tells the you host it.
Still waters run deep.
When you look at yourself,
You don't like what you see.

Down on your own with fashion.
Wrapped up in imperfection.
When then there's only one side to see.
If you look a little closer,
Then maybe you'll discover.

Your more than a pretty face,
Not filled with empty space.
Your beautiful inside.
See you the way I do,
Adjust just your attitude.

Cause we fall and we break,
And we make mistakes.

María Márquez,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17 [Back To Being 17]

Que existen nuevas y mejores emociones
Contigo aprendí
A conocer un mundo nuevo de ilusiones

Que la semana tiene más de siete días
A hacer mayores mis contadas alegrías

Contigo aprendí
A ver la luz del otro lado de la luna
Contigo aprendí
Que tu presencia no la cambio por ninguna

And the motor that was runnin' was the mind of you 
I was scared when I looked at my reflection and the shine I saw were the eyes of you 
I was scared when you touched my lips

No ring on the doorbell, no ring on the phone
And nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me

Your boyfriend's good-looking, he's got it all there
Looks like God made him with something to spare
You look good together scurrying off down the street

Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?
Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?

He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes
But he wouldn't notice me passing him by
I could be in the gutter
Or dangling down from a tree

And won't mind a girl who is clumsy and shy
I wouldn’t mind going with someone that I've never seen

Your arms were like a little paradise
But your arms have changed
And the flicker of a good love?s fire
Has seen brighter days

And played out every scene

To the front-line of the footlights

And a corset to keep her spirits up

I hear them talk about the Palace but it's so far out of reach
So I'll do my time then say goodbye to Panic Beach

And the dying swan pirouettes and fawns
By the light of the street lamp moon

When my trunk is filled with taffeta
Those ""Big time"" hacks won't laugh at us
When my taps are made of silver
I can make the kiddies thrill for just one buck and wing

Sometimes on a Sunday
All dependin' on whatever kinda mood he's in

I keep his glass filled up with sherry
And sing him all his favorite songs
If a tear comes to his eye he may let a month go by
Before he takes away my key
Oh, that sherry starts to taste real good to me

I may be hungry but my rent is free up on Panic Beach
Yeah, I can almost see the palace no longer outta reach
So I'll do my time then say goodbye to Panic Beach

And the roof won't hold the rain

I?d do it again for you

I tried to live outside grace and I was humbled

Only once for a pair of arms around me would I die

Was I ever nearly happy? Only once

Only once was a stupid girl allowed to tempt her fate
Only once did I think twice and twice was once too late
I'm going down like Jezebel and my body aches like hell

Maria McKee,"This one is for the girl who says she's unlucky in love 
You deserve to have the world at your feet 
And if one person, one man could be enough 
I wish it could be me 
I wish it could be me 

This one is for the boy whose daddy never had time for him 
I Wish I could build you a little house for you to hide in 
And give you back your summers 
I'd give you back all your summers 
You still have summers 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet 
Bittersweet 
And the days keep rolling along 

This one is for the girl who says those voices in her head 
Never leave her alone 
Don't listen to your teacher, you're not crazy 
Just smarter than the rest of them 
Paint a picture, write a song 
Tell your story, bang a gong 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet 
Bittersweet 
And the days keep rolling along 
Rolling along 

This one is for the boy who's not allowed to be part of the gang 
You don't need those losers I think you're beautiful 
And you meet a girl and you fall in love and it doesn't work out 
Well it won't be the first time and they don't make a cure for that 
So you eat your breakfast, read a book 
Open up your window, be alone 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet

And the days keep rolling along",Life Is Sweet

Pulled through the needle of you
Torn up I'm wearing it
What I wouldn't give

Woven our hands
Silk is our breath
Wear it for you

Birth without womb

To tear riddle from riddle for you

Maria McKee,"I received a letter, like so many others
Mama said, How's life in the city?
My your sister's grown
And you just missed those awful dixie storms
Thank God they've passed
Those awful dixie storms

I left so long ago
I'd forgotten just what for
But they say
When a big city beckons
You have no choice but to go
And here, there are no dixie storms
Thank God, there are no dixie storms

And the smoke on the street
Makes me wonder why I stay away
From those gentle dixie storms

When I was younger
How I would wonder
What made the sweet Georgia rain
Make me feel so warm
And how God made a dixie storm
And how I loved those dixie storms

And the rumble in the sky
Brings a shudder to my soul
Oh how I loved those dixie storms",Dixie Storms

Maria McKee,"Standin' on a corner,
Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

And you make my lovelight shine shine shine

All of my days, I prayed for the savior to find
Taking you down to swim in the river
Holding my hand, praying you won't let me go

I walk in the night, the lonely moon is calling me
Dreaming aloud, my voice echoes through fallen trees
Spent all my days roaming the valleys
Dreaming of you, the stars turned against us

My lover, your sweet little baby
Has fallen down while you looked away
Lover, your sweet little baby has drowned and died
While you looked right into her eyes

Spent all my days roaming the valleys
Dreaming of you, the stars turned against us

My lover, your sweet little baby
Has fallen down and you looked away

Some friends of mine played a gig in town
Chill so cold, crackin' up my spine
It was just the thing to bring me down

They got me a table in a public spot
The crowd was sparse and preoccupied
It was smoky, loud and hot
And I was dull with thoughts of suicide

Everyone's got a story
Everyone's got a tune
I've never felt so lonely
I've never felt so doomed

Never thought I'd lose the feeling
I'm jaded now and unimpressed
What am I doing spinning my wheels
To end up playing, I don't like this

Everyone's got a story

I guess the prom king missed her

But a strain to forget

We're all just people in the way

Do I still make a splash?
Did the intrepid rover
Bottom out with panache?

And the keys to the city
Were my ticket outside
And I used to dream pretty
Now, I dream I'm alive

Ma, tell your kids every day
We're all just people in the way

And I don't know what to tell you
'Cause I don't know what I believe
I've been beaten down and pimped around
And told so many things

And I'm deafened by the dark
And the cryin' of my face
I'm looking for a day job
In a town that wished me fame

Gather 'round little dreamers
Hey, wherever you are
You were a wink in a streamer
Of a party of stars

I know what you're thinkin' when you don't say what you mean
When the first breath of June comes to fill my empty arms
To brighten up your shadow in the winter of my heart
To find me where the balmy weather catches me off guard

Though the carnival life gonna always shine, you can't turn back the time
So, will you save a place for me in your dreams tonight?

Well I know what you said to me, I know the words so well
They echo on inside of me like pennies in a well
And I wonder, does she take you to that high summer place
Does she trace my kisses on the parchment of your face?
They linger there like sugar should you ever need a taste

Will you remember me?

I walk the streets inside your head like I own every house
I keep your secrets faithfully, just let them on the scalp
And I'm peerin' in the window, lookin' for a place to sleep
I capture my reflection, wipe a tear across my sleeve
I'll give up the ghost at most, will you remember me?

All about love and what it can do to you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is quite a price

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame that on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

I know 'cause I learn a little everyday
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now, I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days is hard to find

I know it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will all be worth it in the end

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

Saturday night and I'm all alone

no ring on the doorbell, no ring on the phone

and nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me


Your boyfriend's good-looking, he's got it all there

looks like God made him with something to spare

you look good together scurrying off down the street


Has he got a friend

Has he got a friend for me



has he got a friend

has he got a friend for me


He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes

but he wouldn't notice me passing him by

I could be in the gutter

or dangling down from a tree


If he knows someone who's graceful and wise

and won't mind a girl who is clumsy and shy

I wouldn?t mind going with someone that I've never seen


Has he got a friend for me

has he got a friend

has he got a friend for me?

Ordinary waiting in line
Nothing gray will spoil my lucky day

See I have a friend, she can read the stars
She tells all the girls about their husbands and cars

While I'm only practical she bends all the rules

Girl, I have to count the days in a lucky dress
Is it time yet, oh
How I hate the minute, how I hate the day

Maria Mena,"It must have been hard; staying in line
Knowing your influences insisted all the time
It must have been strange; living in blue
And see me shut down as though
It was an easy thing to do

But you could tell where I had been
By the way I held my gun
Trying to write anything
While being mocked by an off beat drum.
But I was not honest
I was not healthy
I was not honest, honest

You did the right thing
Covered your scars
Challenged your faith
And closed your eyes driving cars
For all that they knew
You were safe home
But you went through hell
Whenever you were left alone

But you could see where I had been
From the pictures that they took
I tried to look positive at things
Faced myself but didn't look
That was not honest
I was not healthy
I am not honest, honest

I wish you could see
Yourself through my eyes
There's no need to cling
To unnecessary lies
The voice in your head
Whose spirit you stole
Left you for dead
But you dug the hole

And I can tell where you had been
From the marks around your wrists
The red water washed around your sins
But are you as pure as this?
No, you are not honest
You are not healthy
You are not honest, honest

No, you are not honest
You are not healthy
You are not honest, honest",Internal Dialogue
Maria Mena,"Comfortable as I am
I need your reassurance
And comfortable as you are
You count the days

But if I wanted silence
I would whisper
And if I wanted loneliness
I'd choose to go
And if i like rejection
I'd audition
And if I didn't love you
You would know

And why can't you just hold me
And how come it is so hard
And do you like to se me broken
And why do I still care
still care

You say you see the light now
At the end of this narrow hall
I wish it didn't matter
I wish I didn't give you all

But if I wanted silence
I would whisper
And if I wanted loneliness
I'd choose to go
And if i like rejection
I'd audition
And if I didn't love you
You would know

And why can't you just hold me
And how come it is so hard
And do you like to see me broken
And why do I still care

Poor little misunderstood baby
No one likes a sad face
But I can't remember life without him
I think I did have good days

And do you like to see me broken
And why do I still care",Just Hold Me
Maria Mena,"Your patronizing stare can watch me heal. 
What I would give for you to tae the wheel 
It's just been a long time coming 
The strong resemblance to my mother's womb 
Is the reason why I will not leave this room 
It's been a long time coming 

The lack of self-esteem has grown on me 
I'm not as strong as I appear to be 
It's been a long time coming 

My lullaby sounds more like distant screams 
I wake up sleep deprived after every dream 
It's been a long time coming 

My flesh makes little sense compared to yours 
I wish my restlessness would open doors 
It's just been a long time coming

The more I drink the more I wander off
Into a stranger's eyes
I like the way that they reflect my thoughts

What is in this air?
It feels like feathery dust everywhere
And as I breathe it in
I breathe the masculine scent of his skin

And I feel homeless
And I feel homeless

Your comfortable caress
Has triggered unfamiliar restlessness
You and I are we
I feel I've lost my individuality

You're watching me rebel
Believing stories only hearts can tell
But when is it enough?
When do I call my feelings on their bluff

Maria Muldaur,"There's cryin' in the city
All the people are sayin'
I heard it on the mountain
Where I was living

No food for the children
Oh, the times are so bad
Whatever happened to giving

Oh mama, mend the hole in my coat
Take my guitar off the wall
I've got to go see what I can do
And I hope I'll be back by fall

Summer was a dry one
The wind burned across
And the crows carried off
What was left over

Five nights in the valley lights burned
The people did not stop
As the damage they try to recover

Oh mama, mend the hole in my coat
Take my guitar off the wall
I've got to go see what I can do
And I hope I'll be back by fall

There's lightning in the mountain
And the wind blow so sweet
I swear sometimes this must be heaven

Don't look back, don't think about it
Just think about the road beneath your feet
Remember the gift that must be given

Sad eyes, what are you crying for?
Just because love's gone

Don't ya be gloomy, step out into the light
Baby, listen to me, you're gonna be alright
You don't have to sing, no
You don't have to sing no sad songs

I'm gonna write some new lines
A few lines you can maybe get yourself off on
For when you're down
To be turned around upon

Beautiful sad eyes, you know that I love you, child
I live for the time when
The time when those sad eyes shine

Maria Muldaur,"A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind.
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine.

Jumpin' slick was my ruin,
'Cause I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, aww, yeah.
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, huh-huh.

I took this man's love and put it on a shelf,
And, like a fool, I thought I had him all to myself.
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun,
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, huh-huh.
Yeah, that's what I did:
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, aw, yeah.

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away.
She'll give him plenty lovin', 24 hours a day.
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet.
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street.
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman, 'cause she's tough.
I mean, she really cleans up.

And storm clouds are gathering in,

Come snapping at your heels
And there's so much coming at you

When your hands are full of thorns

Where night blooms perfume the breeze

Take your rest with me

Keep sniping from the dark
When the fire burns inside you but
You jump from every spark
When your heart's beset by memories
You wish you'd never made
When the sun comes up an enemy
And nothing gives you shade


In the southland of the heart
Where the saints go lazily
Lie down
Take your rest with me


When the preacher lays his insight down
And claims to lead the blind
When those you trust just get you hooked
And trifle with your mind
When the nightmare's creeping closer
And your wheels are in the mud
When everything's ambiguous
Except the taste of blood


In the southland of the heart
There's no question of degree

I at silly labours!

Me somewhere in China!

Losing at backgammon!

Tudo aquilo, nada disso
Sobrou meu velho vício de sonhar
Pular de precipício em precipício
Ossos do ofício
Pagar pra ver o invisível
E depois enxergar

Que é uma pena
Mas você não vale a pena
Não vale uma fisgada dessa dor
Não cabe como rima de um poema
De tão pequeno
Mas vai e vem e envenena
E me condena ao rancor
De repente, cai o nível
E eu me sinto uma imbecil
Repetindo, repetindo, repetindo
Como num disco riscado
O velho texto batido
Dos amantes mal-amados
Dos amores mal-vividos
E o terror de ser deixada
Cutucando, relembrando, reabrindo
A mesma velha ferida
E é pra não ter recaída
Que não me deixo esquecer

Onde está você?
Somos no papel
Mas não no viver
Viajar sem mim
Me deixar assim
Tive que arranjar
Alguém pra passar
Os dias ruins

Enquanto isso, navegando eu vou
Sem paz
Sem ter um porto
Quase motro, sem um cais
E eu nunca vou te esquecer, amor
Mas a solidão deixa o coração
Neste leva-e-traz

Veja bem além

Saiba: traições
São bem mais sutis

Não foi por maldade

O teu sabor eu quero
Mas nem só beleza eu vi

Vi cidades degradadas
Pessoas desamparadas
Nas grades da solidão

Fogo nos campos nas matas
Queima de arquivo nas praças
Chovia nas ruas do meu coração

O que se vê é vero
O teu sabor eu quero
Mas nem só beleza eu vi

Vi cidades turbulentas
Chacinas sanguinolentas
Pensei que morava nas terras do mal

Choro dos filhos, maldades
Fora dos trilhos, cidades
Pensei que sonhava e era tudo real

O que se vê é vero
O teu sabor eu quero
E a tua beleza eu vi

Vi uma estrela luzindo
A minha porta bateu
Querendo me namorar
Lua cheia clareava
Imaginei que sonhava e era tudo real

Nem ninguém caça mais arrastapé

You may feel drunk

But don't you feel sorry
Don't you get worried
Please don't at all
Don't you take pity
It's my own fault

And there are better days
Then I'm on my way
Just follow the headlight

And don't you feel sorry
Don't you get worried
Please don't at all
Don't you take pity
It's my own fault

And no, don't you feel sorry
Don't you get worried
Please don't at all
Don't you take pity

Maria Volonte,"Ya no tengo la dulzura de sus besos
Vago solo por el mundo y sin amor
Otra boca mas feliz sera la dueña
De esos besos que eran toda mi pasión

Hay momentos que no se lo que me pasa
Tengo ganas de reír y de llorar
Tengo celos tengo miedo que no vuelva
Yo la quiero y no lo puedo remediar

Cantando yo le di mi corazón mi amor
Y desde que se fue yo canto mi dolor
Cantando la encontré cantando la perdí
Como no se llorar cantando he de morir

Virgencita milagrosa perdóname
Si cantando esta canción que vive en mi
Yo te pido que me traigas lo que es mio
Que tan pronto y sin motivo lo perdí

Si es pecado querer tanto en esta vida
Yo te pido de rodillas mi perdón
Yo la quiero tanto y tanto que me muero
Si me faltan las caricias de su amor

Cantando yo le di mi corazón mi amor
Y desde que se fue yo canto mi dolor
Cantando la encontré cantando la perdí
Como no se llorar cantando he de morir",Cantando (Singing)
Maria Volonte,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón 
para olvidar un loco amor 
que más que amor es un sufrir

Y aquí vengo para eso, 
a borrar antiguos besos 
en las besos de otras bocas 

Si su amor fue flor de un día
¿Porqué causa siempre es mía 
esa cruel preocupación? 

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
para olvidar mi obstinación 
y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado 
y pensar que otro a su lado 
pronto, pronto le hablará de amor 

¡Hermano! Yo no quiero rebajarme
ni pedirle, ni llorarle, ni decirle 
que no puedo más vivir

Desde mi triste soledad 
veré caer las rosas 
muertas de mi juventud. 

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris, 
quizá a ti te hiera igual 
algún amor sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche 
sola y triste en esta noche, 
noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo 
aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
para ahogarlo de una vez

Quiero emborrachar al corazón 
para después poder brindar 
por los fracasos del amor

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado

Maria Webster,"At first I was scared when I opened up my head 
And the motor that was runnin' was the mind of you 
I was scared when I looked at my reflection and the shine I saw were the eyes of you 
I was scared when you touched my lips 
And the breath I took was a breath that shook me with a shock 
Like a flame as eternal as a song and the song is you and I 
I will let you breathe through me 
I will let you be with me 

Whenever I'm alone and you're lost out there 
I can feel you breathe ‘cause our lungs we share 
Whenever I'm alone anytime anywhere 
I can feel your heart beat ‘cause our blood we share 

I was scared when you came into my room 
The walls became the sea, your voice was the moon 
Oh when you rocked me in your arms 
Like a song, a wave on the tide of you and I 
I will let you breathe through me 
I will let you be with me 

My heart beats your blood 
Your breath fills my lungs 
Your heart beats my blood 
My breath fills your lungs

Maria Williams,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life
Maria Winther,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

And when I stop to smile it always makes her cry

She kisses me and begs me not to leave her all alone

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Y los ecos sonoros resuenen
Con las voces de ¡unión! ¡libertad!

Antes, patria, que inermes tus hijos
Bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,
Tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,
Sobre sangre se estampe su pie.
Y tus templos, palacios y torres
Se derrumben con hórrido estruendo,
Y sus ruinas existan diciendo:
De mil héroes la patria aquí fue.

¡Patria! ¡Patria! Tus hijos te juran
Exhalar en tus aras su aliento,
Si el clarín con su bélico acento
Nos convoca a lidiar con valor.

¡un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!
¡un laurel para ti de victoria!
¡un sepulcro para ellos de honor!

No need for greed or hunger

Wanted to let you have me

You talkin', you talkin' like you did find somebody else
Stop that, stop that

I might just need to remind
Slide up in there from behind

'Cause love takes time
I don't want to be here

From this hollow in my heart

Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain

Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't want to be here
I don't wanna be here alone

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do inside

To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind

Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday ooh someday

Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only
But when your down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered through alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind

And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long, road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong

That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

I must have been so blind

I'm falling in love with you

There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going thru a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same

Mariah Carey,"If you're lonely and need a friend
And troubles seem like they never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way

Anytime you need a friend, I will be here
You'll never be alone again, so don't you fear
Even if you're miles away, I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely, love will make it alright

When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there to guide you home

Anytime you need a friend, I will be here
You'll never be alone again, so don't you fear
Even if you're miles away, I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely, love will make it alright

If you just believe in me, I will love you endlessly
Take my hand, take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go, I'll never let go

Anytime you need a friend, I will be here
You'll never be alone again, so don't you fear
Even if you're miles away, I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely, it's alright, it's alright

Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end

Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

I gaze out the window 
This cold winter's night 
At all of the twinkling lights 
Alone in the darkness 
Remembering when you were mine 
Everybody's smiling 
The whole world is rejoicing 
And everyone's embracing 
Except for you and I 

Baby I miss you 
Most at Christmas time 
And I can't get you 
Get you off my mind 
Every other season comes along 
And I'm all right 
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time 

In the springtime 
Those memories start to fade 
With the April rain 
Through the summer days 
Till autumn's leaves are gone 
I get by without you 
Till the snow begins to fall 

And then I miss you 
Most at Christmas time 
And I can't get you 
Get you off my mind 
Every other season comes along 
And I'm all right 
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time",Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) [PCM Stereo]
Mariah Carey,"O holy night the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angels' voices 
O night divine 
O night when Christ was born 
O night divine o night 
O night divine

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn 
Fall on your knees 
O hear the angels' voices

Mariah Carey,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Mariah Carey,"Once I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am free

You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free

Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

Once I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty

But now
I am
Now, oh, now
Now
I am free",I Am Free
Mariah Carey,"Oahhh
Yeah
No
Yeah yeah yeah

Once upon a time
You whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairytales
That I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul
And you took control
As you slowly swept me up
And carried me away

You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then
I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fools' paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again
And remember when you came to my window
On a dark and stormy day

Baby, I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down (down)
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me (used haunt, used haunt me)

Long ago
You used to want me

Mariah Carey,"You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say she takes it all for granted
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me",Looking In
Mariah Carey,"You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms",Melt Away
Mariah Carey,"One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart in you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars

Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting drifting drifting drifting

And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars

Underneath the stars, baby, baby",Underneath the Stars
Mariah Carey,"Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was a rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changin' you with a tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there, all at once, I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

With no beginning
And without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so, oh oh yeah
Your eyes let me know, oh oh oh

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe,
I fell so deep, oh oh

When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it

When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing I will survive
Do you lash out and say how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it

Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out

That you care for me
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing I will survive
Do you lash out and say how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind

It'll break you down

Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But never the less

You and me between the sheets (oh)
I want to get intimate 
But you're not within my reach (no, no, no, no)

Mariah Carey,"When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly, butterfly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun

Mariah Carey,"I was wayward child 
With the weight of the world 
That I held deep inside 
Life was a winding road 
And I learned many things 
Little ones shouldn't know 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Funny how one can learn 
To grow numb to the madness 
And block it away 
I left the worst unsaid 
Let it all dissipate 
And I try to forget 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child falling inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 

Guardian angel I 
Sail away on an ocean 
With you by my side 
Orange clouds roll by 
They burn into your image 
And you're still alive 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raise my head to the sky 
And though time rolls by 
Still feel like a child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up

Starry eyed 
As you put your hand in mine

Strewn across the sky 
And we sat close enough 
That we just barely touched 
While roman candles 
Went soaring above us and baby 

Then you put your hand in mine 
And we wandered away 
I was trembling inside 
But I wanted to stay 
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind 
On that Fourth of July 

So starry eyed (so starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside 
Breathless and fervid 
Amid the dandelions 
As it swept over me 
Like the wind trough the trees 
I felt you sigh with a 
Sweet intensity and baby 

Then you put your hand in mine (your hand in mine)
And we floated away 
Delicately lay entwined 
In an intimate daze 
A crescent moon began to shine (began to shine)
And I wanted to stay (stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies 
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

Thunder clouds (thunder clouds)
Hung around (hung around)
So threateningly (so threateningly)
Ominously hovering 
And the sky (the sky)
Opened wide (opened wide)

Mariah Carey,"It's hard to explain 
Inherently it's just always been strange 
Neither here nor there 
Always somewhat out of place everywhere 
Ambiguous 
Without a sense of belonging to touch 
Somewhere halfway 
Feeling there's no one completely the same 

Standing alone 
Eager to just 
Believe it's good enough to be what 
You really are 
But in your heart 
Uncertainty forever lies 
And you'll always be 
Somewhere on the 
Outside 

Early on, you face 
The realization you don't 
Have a space 
Where you fit in 
And recognize you 
Were born to exist 

Standing alone 
Eager to just 
Believe it's good enough to be what 
You really are 
But in your heart 
Uncertainty forever lies 
And you'll always be 
Somewhere on the 
Outside 

And it's hard 
And it's hard 
And it's hard 

Irreversibly 
Falling in between 
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood 
As you are 
As you are

Oh, and God knows 
That you're standing on your own 
Blind and unguided 
Into a world divided 
You're thrown 
Where you're never quite the same 
Although you try, try and try 
To tell yourself 
You really are

It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on 
That warm November night 
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding 
Begging me to turn away 
But I just had to see your face 
To feel alive 
And then you casually walked in the room 
And I was twisted in the web 
Of my desire for you 
My apprehension blew away 
I only wanted you 
To taste my sadness 
As you kissed me in the dark 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

And so we finished the Moet and 
Started feeling liberated 
And I surrendered as you took me 
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment 
I couldn't bear to let you go yet 
So I threw caution to the wind 
And started listening to my longing heart 
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine 
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed 
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot 
The sorrow and the pain 
And melted with you as we stood 
There in the rain 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

Last night I dreamed that I 
Whispered the words I love you 
And touched you so very 
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye 
Pretty baby, how I'm missing you

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 
 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time

Yeah, yeah, Infamous, knock 'em out the box, yo
I got you stuck off the realness
Infamous, knock 'em out the box
I got you stuck off the realness

It wasn't raining yet but it was definitely
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding my inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away but I just had to see your face to feel alive

And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away, I only wanted you
To taste my sadness as you kissed me in the dark

Every time makes feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
I was so caught up in the moment, I couldn't bear to let you go yet
Threw caution to the wind and started listening to my longing heart

And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed for such a long time
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words, ""I love you""
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
(Infamous rocks the box)

I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin' down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us score up in the project call
Third floor gravitates on the staircase

As we embrace strictly loud without the raw base
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you the one that's like my pistol
I said, Crystal, keep you on my side till the ficial

Ain't it ill how we click, boo
Me and you got me stuck off the realness
Just me and you, up on the roof beats, Pebble Beach
Talk to me anytime even when I wit my peeps

Ruler L, why you smell like the perfume Chanel?
Push big G's, rappin' all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top, do it till we both drop
M O B B with Mariah sounds so hot

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)

And go back in time to relieve the splendor
(It was oh so sweet)
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night
(You and I , on that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)

And go back in time to relieve the splendor

Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

and I believe it was a little something like this:

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know there's
Just no getting over you

Ladies and gentleman, Olivia Newton John!
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
(But) baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no where to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you (you)

Mariah Carey,"You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands

I know it’s crazy but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you think that I wouldn’t feel the same
But time melts into nothing, nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I’m filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type

If there’s one spark of hope left in my grasp
I'd hold it with both hands
It’s worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Patiently I've waited

After tonight 
Will you remember 
How sweet and tenderly 
You reached for me 
And pulled me closer 
After you go 
Will you return to love me 
After tonight begins to fade 

I feel your touch caressing me 
This feeling's all I'll ever need 
With every kiss from your sweet lips 
It's like I'm drifting out of time 

Alone will tell 
If you feel the way I feel 
When I look in your eyes 

After tonight (after tonight)
Will you remember 
How sweet and tenderly 
You reached for me and pulled-me closer 
After you go (after you go)

Ya know, ya know

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay so it's 5 am and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're 
Trying to reach me, probably because you see that I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me
(Baby don't cry)

Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo 
Trying to find relief on the radio (ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears, but they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two and try to forget you (ya know, ya know)

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me (Baby don't cry)

Baby here me when I say
Let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time and worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby here me when I say
A playa feeling good today
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man you's a fool for this
But on the real dog I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-o double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Late at night like a little child (I'm like a little child) (dry your eyes)

Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
And could have been so perfect
Still I cry, I cry, I cry (you know, yeah)

Being so how destined for me
Got me in the days, but we're not the same

She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends
She want to creep past the block spyin' again
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me ""Heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does and uh

Mariah Carey,"I've often wondered if there's ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness and sought stability

A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew, that flower changed
She started flaying in the wind
Like golden petals scattering

And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me every time
I try to touch you

But I miss you dandelion
And even love you

I gravitated towards a patriarch so young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life within a maze of misery

A boy and a girl befriended me
We're bonded through despondency
I stayed so long but finally
I fled to save my sanity
And I miss you little sis 
And Little brother
And I hope you realize
I'll always love you
(Always love you)
And although you're struggling
You will recover (we're gonna make it maybe)
And I miss you little sis and little brother

So many I considered
Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping
Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep
(Sleep) (Sleep) (Sleep)

And I missed a lot of life
But I'll recover
Though I know you really like
To see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd
Forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you

I really loved you

But you drove me away

Try to bring me down
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try but they can't take that away from me

Oh, they, they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

'Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try but they can't take that away from me

No, they can't take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go

Oh, they can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or lose faith in my dreams

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Mariah Carey,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.",Do You Know Where You're Going To? [Theme From Mahogany]
Mariah Carey,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true oh
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need, and I
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow, and I
I just wanna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you

All I want for Christmas is you, baby",All I Want for Christmas Is You [So So Def Rmx]
Mariah Carey,"I've been waiting for someone
To come into my life
Who would bring me joy
And give me pleasure

I have taken chances on
Romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart
It's you I treasure

You and only you can
Make me feel the way I do
You and only you can
Make it better

You and only you can
Do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and
That's forever and ever

My love's been
Waiting for you
All my life
My heart's been waiting too

All my life

I've been wishing
On a star
I've been praying
On my knees

I've got some sly and
Sexy tricks to show you
Most of all
I'll give you anything

Boy that you need
To keep you right
Here by my side
I know you
I'll show you

You and only you can
Make me feel the way I do
You and only you can
Make it better

You and only you can
Do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and

Mariah Carey,"When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on

Now I bring you home
You told me goodnight's not enough for you
I'm sorry baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
No, I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Not like you think
I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Were expecting a one night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand

I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
Only trying to be nice
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on

Babe now why should I
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on

When I took you out
Iknew what you were all about
