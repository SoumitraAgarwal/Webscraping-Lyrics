Ramones,"Feedback blasting out my ears
Makes me so high
I love all the monitor men
But why are they alive
The van is making me crazy
It's just like being in the navy

Doomsday, doomsday's coming - 1981
But until things blow
I'm gonna have some fun
The bubble's going to explode
Probably never live to get old

[Chorus:]
But I just want to have some fun
Probably won't see no money
I just want to have some fun
Before they throw me in the sanitarium

Feedback blasting out my ears
Makes me so high
I love all the monitor men
But why are they alive
Well Monte's making me crazy
It's just like being in the navy

Ramones,"Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain

And though I'm really tryin'
I think I may start cryin'
My heart can't wait an other day

When you kiss me I just gotta
Kiss me I just gotta
Kiss me I just gotta say :

Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you

I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way

Oh I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name

Oh tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same

Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you","Baby, I Love You"
Ramones,"Somebody calls me on the phone
Say ""hey-hey, is Artie home?
You want to take a walk
You want to go cop
You want to go get some Chinese Rock?""

I'm livin' on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm livin' on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

The plaster fallin' of the wall
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch

I'm livin' on a Chinese Rock

Come out of the ground, not making a sound,

I don't want to live my life again.
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
I don't want to live my life again.

Follow Victor to the sacred place,
This ain't a dream, I can't escape,
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones,
Spirits moaning among the tombstones,
And the night, when the moon is bright,
Someone cries, something ain't right.

The moon is full, the air is still,
All of a sudden I feel a chill,
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away,
Skeletons dance, I curse this day,
And the night when the wolves cry out,
Listen close and you can hear me shout.

Ramones,"Leave your cares behind
Come with us and find
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

Beyond the seas of thought 
Beyone the realm of what 
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not 

Come along if you care 
Come along if you dare 
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind 

But please realise 
You'll probably be surprised 
For it's the land unknown to man 
Where fantasy is fact 
So if you can, please understand 
You might not come back 
Come along if you care 
Come along if you dare 
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see 
How happy life could be 
If all of mankind 
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind 
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind

Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

You could relate, I bomb ya chest like Kuwait
You dead weight, and I'm about to shut down ya gates
Forgive me Lord, I'm on the take, give me a brake

Been around the world, gettin loot
I got future plans in the Meadowlands
Pushin in the phat lands

Seein my mans, mad fans sittin in the stands
Goin crazy, Rampage, too young to fade

And my trunk load to unfold, I'm out to get the gold

Your vision is blind, no you can't see the victory.
You in the street, it's gettin deep.
You rolled up with the wrong peeps, you're the black sheep.
You won't protest, drop when your little brother got shot. (Bang!)

In neon en natrium licht
De stad is een kermis van kleur

Steeds een ander gezicht
Steeds opnieuw jouw gezicht, jouw gezicht

Steeds weer nieuwe avonturen

In de armen van de stad

Kom, ik wacht al zoveel uren
Op het grote avontuur

De liefde is als regen op mijn huid
Maar mijn koel gevoel dat mij omsluit

Hier ver vandaan
Ver weg, samen met jou
Laten we gaan, laten we gaan, laten we gaan

De stad lokt met duizenden stemmen
Van mensen alleen in de nacht
De stad zingt een lied met hun woorden
Er is altijd weer een ander die wacht
Steeds een ander die wacht
Steeds ben ik het die wacht
Op jou wacht

Ik wil verder gaan en dwalen
Door steeds andere verhalen
In de armen van de stad
In mijn armen
Ik wil nachtenlang verdwalen
In de stad van jouw verhalen
In jouw armen wil ik dat
Ik wil altijd verder dwalen

Als ik je aankijk, heb ik nergens meer greep op
Ik swing door de straten als een discodanser
Ik sta voor je, trillend van dankbaarheid
Mateloos stroom ik over, mateloos

En dan in bad, lach niet, ik kus je voeten over en weer
Je haalt adem alsof je slaapt, maar je slaapt niet
Ik zeg hardop: Wat ben jij prachtig
Je schiet in een lach omdat ik vroeger
Een liedje heb gemaakt over twee deftige
Oude dames in het bad, die tegen elkaar zeien
Wat zijn wij prachtig
Wat zijn wij prachtig allebei
We komen niet meer bij

Dan zijn we stil, je beroert me
Ik kus je voeten een eeuwigheid
We steken het licht aan en nemen een sigaret
En kleden ons aan om ergens wat koffie te drinken
Om op de tramhalte stil tegen je aan te staan
Met gesloten ogen de auto's voorbij te horen gaan
En de stemmen van mensen, voetstappen, de fietsen
Stil tegen je aan te staan in eeuwigheid

Om dan later een beetje lachend
De eerste de beste zijstraat in te slaan
Om dan in bed stil tegen je aan te liggen met open ogen
Je vindt me een klein jongetje
Je aait m'n neus, m'n hoofd, m'n haar
Stil tegen je aan te liggen in eeuwigheid

Je maakt grapjes tegen me dat je straks
Een boterham met pindakaas klaar zult maken
En morgen mag ik naar de speeltuin
Want eens zul je er niet meer zijn
Een eeuwigheid stil naast je te liggen
En tot die tijd wil je me alles geven

Ik adem je in tot ik niet meer kan

Ramsey,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Ramsey Lewis,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best

Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

But when I'm playing love with you it never ends
And when I'm feeling all my days aren't going right

Feeling like you can't go on?

Tell me, are you going through changes
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way

I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care

But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Are drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way

Are you trying to find a beginning
Something just to hold on to?
Always know that love will find a way, yeah

Is it hard this life you're living?
Does the world seem so unkind?
Don't you worry, love will find a way

Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
If you know where you are going
There is nothing you can't do

'Cause problems will come
And they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

He's back in the hole where they got him living
Like a rat but he's smarter than that nine lives
Like a cat take him to the youth authority home
First thing you learn is that you got to make it
In this world alone

Now he's gotten out he's gotten free he's gotta go
Gotta car twenty one years old he's runnin' from the
Bar his pager's beepin' he's got in deep in
Whatever he can move on in you know that kid's a creepin'

In tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below
His eye his mother cries she knows that he is strong enough
To die he's rollin' in the Cadillac it's midnight sunroof is down

In the core of this capital dynasty,

We're still a part of this goddamn money machine.
Right after the show, strengthened with a bottle of wine,
He said to me: ""Diese T-shirt ist ja mein,
You capitalistische schwein"" !!

And aimed right at my head,
I got scared and took shelter right behind my own amp
And the glass swished above my head.

Everybody's dancing and stomping their feet
One guy is shouting in a megaphone
He said this is ours and ours alone

Just a kid full of dreams
We didn't have much but an old radio
Music came from places we'd never been

Growing up in a prairie town
Learning to drive in the snow
Not much to do so you start a band
And soon you've gone as far as you can go

Winter nights are long, summer days are gone
Portage and Main fifty below
Springtime melts the snow, rivers overflow
Portage and Main fifty below
Portage and Main fifty below

All the bands in a prairie town
Try to outdo the next in line
Learning records out of Liverpool
Dreams of England on their Minds

On the other side of Winnipeg
Neil and The Squires played the Zone
But then he went to play
For awhile in Thunder Bay
He never looked back and he's never coming home

Just a band from a prairie town
Sometimes we'd drive from coast to coast
One call from LA and we'd pack and fly away
But in our hearts we're always prairie folk

Looking back at a prairie town
People ask me why I went away
To fly with the best, sometimes you have to leave the nest
But the prairies made me what I am today",Prairie Town

By;Randy Brown


Rather hurt, hurt myself
Than to hurt you

All the talk
That's going around town
About me and Mary Ann
It's getting you down down down
And I'm aware of all your friends
Calling you a fool
Trying to show you the place
To where I'm using you you you

But after all these years
We've been together
I would think by now
You would know me better
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to hurt you

Uhhh, Uhhh, Uhhh, Uhhh

Now I can understand
You being all upset
The whole towns laughing, huh
And talking behind your back
But I shouldn't have to remind you
How low down people are
They see us doing good
What better way to tear us apart

But just remember
Before you walk out the door
The words I told you
Twelve long years ago
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to hurt you, baby
I don't want to hurt you no no no no
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to hurt you, baby
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to hurt you
I don't want to hurt you

Because you mean
So much to me baby, baby
I'll give you all I got
If you want it girl
I'd rather hurt myself
Hurt myself
Hurt myself
If I ever hurt you baby, oh, ho, ho
I'd throw myself
In the lions den
Than let a day go by
That you don't smile again

Randy Burns,"Oh I will never be the one
To say that you're wrong for what's been done
For I know that you are young
Can't tell where you belong

So if you find a word, please use it
'Fore your trembling tongue does lose it
Even though the world confuse it
I'll still understand

For I will never make you bend
Or even ask that you pretend
To lend only to be there when I need you

Turn around,
Think it over,
And surely you will see
That time has made no change in me

And everything this road had taught me
I gave freely when you sought me
Somehow don't you think you ought to lend a thought to me?

For I could tell you of my tears
Yet you'll not tell me of your fears
Is it easier to say you never cared for me at all?

And I know all that you have suffered
Must I pay back for all others
Till the day that you discover 
I was not the one?

Turn around,
Think it over,
And surely you will see
That time has really made no change in me

And can you bear to watch your dreams
Be cast aside as empty schemes?
When even that which truth conceives
Now you cannot believe

For there is neither dusk nor dawn
When all cause for time is gone
Just waiting for a thought to spawn
And bring your vision on

And even words within this song
Are meaningless when taken wrong
Even those who listen on 
May ne'er hear what I say

Turn around,
Think it over,
And surely you will see
That time has really made no change in me",No Change in Me
Randy Burns,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots

You're a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do

Ooh I've been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun

I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, and it's that man you fought with
This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.

Sometimes I've been to cryin' for unborn children
That might have made me complete

The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Means that someday you'd say goodbye
Remember my friends
Goodbye's not the end

Randy Crawford,"It was way past midnight
And she still couldn't fall asleep
This night the dream was leavin'
She tried so hard to keep

And with the new day's dawnin'
She felt it driftin' away
Not only for a cruise, not only for a day

Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

As the day came up, she made a stop
She stopped waitin' another day for
The captain of her heart

Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

Randy Crawford,"Whoa, whoa, changes
I've been going through some
Everybody does, everybody does
Though they're subtle ones

Whether it's the way we look at life
And all of life's possibilities
Or the way we comb our hair
Or interesting faces

When day becomes night
When night becomes morning
When wrong becomes right
When right becomes a warning

When the good in us becomes better
When the good die young
When we look at all the seasons
To find we challenged none

Whether it's the way we look at mountains
Decorating our horizons
Or the way we search our hearts
To free our minds

Whoa, changes, changes
Oh oh, changes

Look at the universe, look at the cryin'
Look at our children, look at our babies
Look at the flowers

Whoa, everybody does, everybody does
Go through changes, my, my, my
As I search my heart right now, ooh, ooh

",Let It Rain
Randy Crawford,"If only you'd return my love, I'd be a flower
With colors shining so lovely
The sweetest smell there will ever be

If only you'd return my love, I'd be a teardrop
That's rolling down from your eyes to your lips
And slowly melting into your skin

Memories of our love as one appear before my eyes
You have enchanted me
Mesmerizing scenes of love, you shared a passion
My precious one, my precious one

Wasn't love strong enough to make believe?
Wasn't love pure enough, enough to dream?
My love is strong enough to break the dark inside of you
Inside of me

If only you'd return my love, I'd be an angel
I'm sure of everything I am
Desire strong enough to give love

Memories of the love you gave, satisfying joy
I feel you close to me
Mesmerizing love we made
I remember all my precious one, my precious one

Wasn't love strong enough to make believe?
Wasn't love pure enough, enough to dream?
My love is strong enough to break the dark inside of you
And shine through

Is it true that flowers bloom at night?
So high I attended with great care
Is it true that angels spread their wings
So wide because of what they bring?

Wasn't love strong enough to make believe?
Wasn't love pure enough, enough to dream?
My love is strong enough to break the dark inside of you
And shine through

Wasn't love strong enough to make believe?
Wasn't love pure enough, enough to dream?

'Cause I have to have you
Say I’m dreaming

Who will always be my first love
It’s you
Who first showed me who I really was

In you

I’m searching for
It’s true, I adore you

A merry go round
Sometimes it’s up
Sometimes it’s down

Like the sun and the rain
Even good loves found the change
Boy, you should know
'Cause the love we have we shouldn’t let go

Now you can walk away
Go on without me
Or you can try to stay
And make this easy

Though it’s hard
If you really wanna be alone
It’s okay, okay

A merry go round
Sometimes it’s up
Sometimes it’s down

Leaves you breathless when two hearts make one

And if you keep it young, your song is always sung

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do?

Randy Edelman,"Everybody always asks me
How I got to play so fine
And friends, I'm gonna tell ya
It really did take some time

Yes, after years and years of practice
And a case of real bad knees
While the other guys were out playin' with the football
I was home bangin' on the keys
And it got me

Right were I am, this is me
Playing the piano
I hope ya like what I do
It's for you, and I'll try and sing right too

I guess I'm really very lucky
That I've got this thing to play
'Cause it can really make me feel good
Even when it's cloudy and grey

Yes, after years and years of practice
And awful allergies that made me sneeze
And now the other guys are out playin' with their girlfriends
And I was still bangin' on the keys

No, I can't make rhymes
No, I can't do anything

And I here it's gone out to cry
So I'm gonna say some kind words to you

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?

Whistling winds start to blow,
Strange, the bleak sky comforts so,
Even the dark has its own sort of glow.
Autumn colors changed by storm,
Yet somehow they're keeping me warm,

And I feel the peace as I look through my window,
I feel a hope as I turn toward the sea,
Somehow it hurts when you find what you wanted,
There is a dream that is setting us free.
And I feel the golden fire burning,
Outside the raindrops brush the tree.
Isn't it nice things can happen,
Like you and me.

Passing by I almost missed
Meeting the belle of the band.
But something sparked so I persist
I never realized I'd melt in her hand.
Never easy, but somehow so right
We drifted on wheels through the night.

[Chorus]

Nobody knows what is out in the distance,
Somehow it's hard not to stray from the line
Some people wish to arrive at perfection
But you never know up ahead what you'll find

Hi Honey, whatcha doing for the
Rest of your life
I've been waiting such a long, long time
And you know what honey?
Meetin' you here, man, it just
Really feels like fate
Oh I, I bet you didn't see me as a marrying type
Let's take it slow I don't just want one
Night, oh no

If you're looking for that you might as well look somewhere else
Well, because I'm just not that kind of guy

Kids, oh I love kids
Dogs, in-laws, and a piece of land
Dirty diapers in my mini van
Aw man, I can hardly wait

Oh a
Man has got to do what a man's gotta do
Anything it takes to make her think you're cool
Aw, you got nothin' to lose so
Go on and try
Just walk right up, and smile, and look her dead in the eye

Let's start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell 'em we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to

Start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss,
My lips, your lips

Let's start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait",Goodnight Kiss

Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild, like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on, like a cowboy

I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would

I know it's hard on you but like I always do

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away

Randy Houser,"He hadn't told his kids, he hadn't told his wife
Made plans to leave it all, leave it all behind that night,
He had his car gassed up, he had his suitcase packed
He planned to hit the road, he hit hard and not look back
He made it 40 miles out of town
Turned on that radio and turned that car around

That's the power of a song
When it grabs you by the heart
It's gonna find you when it wants to
No matter where you are
That's a miracle of music
Love's the only thing as strong
That can move you when you hear it
That's the power, the power of a song

His voice inside her head said, you're not strong enough
But in her heart she knows, that love shouldn't hurt that much
Knew what her future held, like the back of his hand
She tried a hundred times, but she couldn't leave that man
She made it 40 miles out of town
And turned up that radio and never turned that car around

Well that's the power of a song
When it grabs you by the heart
It's gonna find you when it wants to

Randy Houser,"I'd like to say it was perfect
And growing up was a fairytale
But Hollywood don't make no movies
About a house up on wheels 
Down a dirt road, Mississippi
Tucked back in the trees
Route 3 Box 250 D

Well the man my mama married
Had a mean streak in his blood
And when he took to drinking
He'd take it out on us
And I could hear my mama crying
That made it hard to sleep
Route 3 Box 250 D

That's where I became a man
Long before my time
And since I left I ain't been back
But I go back in my mind

Thank God for Buford Bailey
He had a pond he'd let me fish
That's where I'd run off to
Every chance I'd get
And I would pray that God was listening
And He'd come rescue me
Route 3 Box 250 D

Then one day, my uncle pulled up in a pickup truck
Loaded up everything
Wasn't much but it was everything

That ain't been boarded up 'fore the banks shut down.
At first glance, you might think times were hard

There ain't no coal comin' out of that shaft
There's rust all over the railroad tracks
You can't see nothing but a big old black
Cloud up in the sky
And if the good Lord don't see fit
To send a little sun down on these pines, that's fine
Old Leonard gonna make us shine

Way back before these mines were tapped
He had a bigger dot there on the map
Who knows, we might get there again

Wonderin if he'd ever make it home
She loved the singer
She just couldn't live the song.

She loved the hero
Even more than that 
She loved the man without the mask when no one was around
She let him lean on
Her lovin' arms when he would call
He'd fall, she'd pick him up off of the ground
And in her dreams, the face she see's ain't the one taken with a camera
It's the one after the mask is taken off
She loved the singer, 
She just couldn't live the song.

Trying to hold him is like trying to hold a flame
But she was always just one of a million screaming his name

She loved the poet
Words straight from his heart
Tear you apart then start
To make you fall right back in love
And every day the radio plays one familiar
Then hits her just a little too strong

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going
Quite like you do when you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town
Something to talk about

We were taillights-fading from some blue-lights-chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancin’
Didn’t take long, just a couple of songs
You know it’s last call when the law comes walkin’ in

So we were taillights-fading from some blue-lights-chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Randy Howard,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul

There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

As the sun was going down
She was lyin' on the beach
In her graduation gown

She was wrapped up in a blanket
I could tell, she knew her way around
And as I lay down beside her
Know, she never made a sound

On down the beach
Came the beach cleaning man
Scoopin' up the papers
Flattening down the sand

Got to run away
That big white truck is closin' in
And we'll get wounded if we stay

Now Lucinda lies buried
'Neath the California sand

They sent her to low school

They don't live in cabins like the old folks used to do
Their cabin is a penthouse up on Lennox Avenue
Underneath that Harlem moon

They just live for dancing
They're never blue or forlorn
Ain't no sin to laugh or grin

Randy Newman,"There she is sitting there
Out behind the smoke house in her rocking chair
She don't do nothin'
She don't say nothin'
She don't feel nothin'
She don't know nothin'
Maybe she's crazy  I don't know
But maybe that's why I love her so

Her papa was a midget
Her mama was a whore
Her grandad was a newsboy 'til he was eighty four
What a slimy old bastard he was
Man don't you think I know she hates me
Man don't you think I know that she's no good
If she knew how she'd be unfaithful to me
I think she'd kill me if she could
Maybe she's crazy I don't know
But maybe that's why I love her so

I'm not afraid of the grey wolf
Who stalks through our forest at dawn
As long as I have her beside me
I have the strength to carry on

Today we will be married
And all the freaks that she knows will be there
And all the people from the village will be there
To congratulate us
I will carry her across the threshold
I will make dim the light
I will attempt to spend my love within her
But though I try with all my might
She will laugh at my mighty sword
She will laugh at my mighty sword
Why must everybody laugh at my mighty sword?
Lord, hep me if you will
Maybe we're both crazy, I don't know
Maybe that's why I love her so",A Wedding in Cherokee County

And he makes more money than you ever will
He just got married to a Polish girl
With a space between her teeth

He was helping out my Pop in the barbershop
Sweeping up the hair as it would drop
On to the boardwalk and out of the shop

How 'bout lettin' him out today?
I can promise you he'll be OK

Knocked over some bottles with the handle of his broom

Daddy took him to a baseball game, and still he cried
Daddy took him to the zoo, and still he cried
Daddy said, ""Son, I ain't angry,
But I'm so disappointed in you.""

Randy Newman,"A rabbit bein' chased by a big, black dog
Through the early mornin' fog
Over the meadow and past the bog,
They were runnin'

The rabbit had jumped a fence or two
Cause that's what rabbits like to do
Big black dog had to jump 'em too
They was runnin'

Now this black dog had a brother
'Cept he was white as snow
One looked like the other
Least that's how the story go

So the black dog's chasin' the rabbit down the road
And he seen a familiar face he knowed
He said, ""Hey there white dog, what you say?
Take over chasin' this rabbit, all right?
Thank you, get away!
Take over chasin' this rabbit
Or they'll be no rabbit stew today for us.""

And here what the white dog say
He say, ""That rabbit smiled as he went by
He know he got you beat, that's why.
You wait here and I'll chase a while
Cause I hate to see a rabbit smile.""
So off he go, off the white dog go.

Now when that little rabbit looked around
He jumped four feet off the ground
He said, ""That big old dog that's chasin' me
Why, he's taken off his jacket and he's runnin' free
He's taken off his jacket and he's catchin' me.""

Now there's a moral to this story
For crazy rabbits with dreams of glory
Any rabbit think a dog wear a jacket
Should get out of the rabbit racket.
One dog's brother is another dog's child
And no one likes to see a rabbit smile",The Joke [#]

So when he died I put a razor in his coffin
And poured Vaseline all over his head.

The people come from mile around
To follow Daddy's coffin to the graveyard
And put poor Daddy's body in the ground

Ran to the room

Lay in wait for him

Many, many, many years ago
We lived out in North Hollywood then
In a steamy little bungalow

My baby brother and me
Playin' cowboys all day out there in the valley

Went off to high school
When I was thirteen
I was kind of advanced

My daddy had to come down to the station to get me, he say
""Where is my angry young man?""

Take me back
Baby, please take me back
I don't wanna live here by this dirty old airport, in this greasy little shack
Take me back
Baby, please take me back
Just give me a chance and we'll start all over again

Was just a summertime thing
She went back to school
When the school bell rang
Now I do my laundry by myself
Every night I eat alone

Won't you let me come back home?

Passed every test

He could be one of the best""

Dad was a captain in the army

Made our getaway

Got on the Dixie Flyer bound for New Orleans
Across the state of Texas to the land of dreams
On the Dixie Flyer bound for New Orleans
Back to her friends and her family in the land of dreams

Her own mother came to meet us at the station
Her dress as black as a crow in a coal mine
She cried when her little girl got off the train
Her brothers and her sisters came down from Jackson, Mississippi
In a great green Hudson driven by a Gentile they knew
Drinkin' rye whiskey from a flask in the back seat
Tryin' to do like the Gentiles do
Christ, they wanted to be Gentiles, too
Who wouldn't down there, wouldn't you
An American Christian, God damn

My daddy said ""Son  rise from your bed.""

Here's your little brown cowboy pants  put 'em on
Here's your little brown shoes  can you tie them yourself?

I said, ""Work?  What are you talking about?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?""
He said ""Yes I am!""
And drove off into the morning light

For a while I stood there, on the sidewalk
A Roy Rogers lunch pail in my hand
Then I heard sweet children's voices calling
And I began to understand
They said, ""Four eyes!  Look like you're still sleeping!""

One side for White and one side for Colored
I remember trash cans floatin' down Canal Street
It rained every day one summer
Momma used to take me to Audubon Park
Show me the ways of the world
She said  ""here comes a white boy  there goes a black one, that one's an octoroon
This little cookie here's a macaroon, that big round thing's a red balloon
And the paper down here's called the Picayune
And here's a New Orleans tune""

In 1948 my Daddy came to the city
Told the people that they'd won the war
Maybe they'd heard it, maybe not
Probably they'd heard it and just forgot
Cause they built him a platform there in Jackson Square
And the people came to hear him from everywhere
They started to party and they partied some more
Cause New Orleans had won the war
(We knew we'd do it, we done whipped the Yankees)

Daddy said, ""I'm gonna get this boy out of this place
Bound to sap his strength
People have fun here, and I think that they should
But nobody from here every come to no good
They're gonna pickle him in brandy and tell him he's saved
Then throw fireworks all 'round his grave""

You gotta use a stepladder to lick their love thing
It's a family place too now, so bring the kids along

Or the humblest Yucca tree
He chases round this desert
Cause he thinks that's where I'll be

From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in heaven at the prayers you offer me

The temples that we built to you
Have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please, please let us be?""

But lyrically, it's another story of a guy getting himself into a bad relationship 
That he can't get out of. 

He says, ""When you fall in love with someone who doesn't love you
Someone who treats you so badly it ramifies your head
Someone who doesn't want you but won't let you go
Someone who thinks you're crazy and tells you so, over and over and over

If this happens to you, you're better off dead.""
It's exaggerated, but there's a kernel of truth there for so many people. 
You don't know what bad is until you feel that. 
I know what I'm talking about because I was once a woman who loved too much. 

I know some critic is going to think I don't know what the word ramify means, or how to use it. 
Made up an alternate verb form of it here, like a made-up R&B word, like the ""puppetudes"" of love. Wanted to say how there would be ramifications from something 
That happens to your head in this kind of a relationship. 
I should've said ""blamifies"" or something to make it really obvious I was playing with the word, but I just didn't give a fuck.",Better off Dead

Schools, pretending to have certain businesses. He made a profession of lying.

Randy Newman,"This is a World War I song. 
World War I fascinates me because it was such a shock to the world. 
Nothing before or since has come close. 
It was a horrible, horrible event. 
It was modern weaponry and cavalry and then tanks. 
They fought for four years over a hundred yards, some ridiculously small amount of ground. 
It's the stupidest event in history. 
This is one of those songs that I just can't sing - it's right in one of the cracks in my range.

And on the trail one day

Isn't he the guy, the guy who left you crying?
Isn't he the one who made you blue?
When you remember those nights in his arms,
You know you gotta make up your mind
 
Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over?
There's no easy way tosee this through
All the broken dreams, all the disappointments
Oh girl, what you gonna do?
Your hear keeps sayin', ""It's just not fair""
But still you gotta make up your mind",The One You Love
Randy Newman,"Pretty little baby
How come you never come around
Pretty little baby
How come you never come around
I sent you all them pretty flowers
Now you're nowhere to be found

I call you up at midnight sometimes I must admit
But I I find you're not at home
My head heats up like a furnace
My heart grows colder than a stone
So what's the good of all this money I got
If every night I'm left here all alone
It's a gun that I need

Shame shame shame shame shame
I ain't ashamed of nothing
Shame shame shame shame shame
I don't know what you're talking about

All right let's talk a little business
You know what I'm saying
A man of my experience of life
Don't expect a beautiful young woman like yourself
To come on over here every day
And have some old dude banging on
Her like a gypsy on a tambourine
That's not what we're talking about
That's not what we're talking about
That's not what we're talking about

But I will say this
I've been all over the world
I've seen some wonderful things
I haven't been well lately
I have no one to share my plans, my dreams
My hopes and my schemes, my

Shame shame shame shame shame
You could be right
I've sunk pretty low this time
Shame shame shame shame shame
These are truly desperate times

Saw your little sandals baby
Out behind the wishing well
Down here in the cool depths of the quarter
Where the rich folk dwell
And I pictured you in diamonds, satins and pearls
Come on back to daddy
Daddy miss his little baby girl

Now, my father, he was an angry man
You cross him he made you pay
I myself, am no longer an angry man
Don't make me beg you
Don't make me beg

Do you know what if feels like
To wake up in the morning
Have every joint in your body aching, god damn it
Do you know what it feels like
To have to get up in the middle of the night
And sit down to take a piss
You do know
So you say
I have my doubts, missy
Do you know what it feels like
To have to beg a little bum like you for love
God damn it you little b****
I'd kill you if I didn't love you so much
Shame shame shame shame shame
Shut up

Forgive me
My unfocused words
I was flying blind
I lost my mind (shame shame shame)
If you could find it in your heart, if you got one
To forgive me
I'd be ever so grateful (shame shame shame)
Will you stop that please (shame shame shame)
Will you stop that please
I'm trying to talk to someone (shame)
Thank you
You know, I have a lexus now
I don't get out much

Randy Newman,"When Karl Marx was a boy
He took a hard look around
He saw people were starving all over the place
While others were painting the town
The public spirited boy
Became a public spirited man
So he worked very hard and he read everything
Until he came up with a plan

There'll be no exploitation
Of the worker or his kin
No discrimination 'cause of the color of your skin
No more private property
It would not be allowed
No one could rise too high
No one could sink too low
Or go under completely like some we all know

If Marx were living today
He'd be rolling around in his grave
And if I had him here in my mansion on the hill
I'd tell him a story t'would give his old heart a chill

It's something that happened to me
I'd say, Karl I recently stumbled
Into a new family
With two little children in school
Where all little children should be
I went to the orientation
All the young mommies were there
Karl, you never have seen such a glorious sight
As these beautiful women arrayed for the night
Just like countesses, empresses, movie stars and queens
And they'd come there with men much like me
Froggish men, unpleasant to see
Were you to kiss one, Karl
Nary a prince would there be

Oh Karl the world isn't fair
It isn't and never will be
They tried out your plan
It brought misery instead
If you'd seen how they worked it
You'd be glad you were dead
Just like I'm glad I'm living in the land of the free
Where the rich just get richer
And the poor you don't ever have to see
It would depress us, Karl
Because we care
That the world still isn't fair",The World Isn't Fair
Randy Newman,"Look at the light coming over me
Show me a man who's gentle and kind
And I'll show you a loser
Now, show me a man who takes what he wants
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
So the poet sings

When you're a fool in love
And nothing goes the way you plan
And no one cares and no one understands
That you're a fool and you're in love
Never another spring for you,
Never a robin to sing for you,
You're out there on your own
When you're a fool in love

When you're a fool in love
Seems like the skies are always grey
You turn around there's someone in your way
And its you, and you're in love
Sometimes you think that your luck has changed
And a rainbow explodes 'cross the sky,
But when you're a fool in love
You'll be a fool 'til the day you die",A Fool In Love

With a million or two
I'd live in a penthouse

With some smart ass New York Jew
And the Jew laughed at Lester Maddox
And the audience laughed at Lester Maddox too

Well, he may be a fool but he's our fool

We drink too much and we laugh too loud
We're too dumb to make it no Northern town
We keepin' the niggers down

We got no-necked oilmen from Texas
And good ol' boys from Tennessee
And college men from L.S.U.

You see, he's got his dignity
Down here we're too ignorant to realize
That the North has set the nigger free

And he's free to be put in a cage
In the South-Side of Chicago, the West-Side
And he's free to be put in a cage in Hough in Cleveland

A few words
In defense of our country
Whose people aren't bad
Nor are they mean
Now, the leaders we have
While they're the worst that we've had
Are hardly the worst
This poor world has seen

Let's turn history's pages, shall we?

Take the Caesars, for example
Why, with the first few of them
They were sleeping with their sister, stashing little boys in swimming pools, and burning down the city
And one of 'em, one of 'em appointed his own horse to be Counsel of the Empire
That's like vice president or something
That's not a very good example right now, is it?
But here's one:
Spanish Inquisition
That's a good one
Put people in a terrible position
I don't even like to think about it
Well, sometimes I like to think about it

Just a few words
In defense of our country
Whose time at the top
Could be coming to an end
Now, we don't want their love
And respect at this point's pretty much out of the question
But in times like these
We sure could use a friend

Hitler
Stalin
Men who need no introduction

King Leopold of Belgium, that's right
Everyone thinks he's so great
Well, he owned the Congo
He tore it up too
Took the diamonds
Took the silver
Took the gold
You know what he left 'em with?

Malaria

You know, a president once said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself""
Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid
It's patriotic, in fact
Color-coded
What we supposed to be afraid of?
Why, of being afraid
That's what terror means, doesn't it?
That's what it used to mean

You know, it pisses me off a little that this Supreme Court's gonna outlive me
Couple young Italian fellas and a brother on the Court now too
But I defy you, anywhere in the world, to find me two Italians as tight ass as the two Italians we got
And as for the brother
Well, Pluto's not a planet anymore either

The end of an empire
Is messy at best
And this empire's ending
Like all the rest
Like the Spanish Armada
Adrift on the sea
We're adrift in the land of the brave
And the home of the free

I tell you why
Has anybody seen me lately
I tell you why
I caught something that made me so sick
That I thought that I would die
And I almost did

First my knees begun to tremble
My heart begin to pound
First my knees begun to tremble
My heart begin to pound, was arythmy
Got it to lost my equilibrium
Still face down on the ground

As I lay there on the cold pavement
A tear ran down my face
'Cause I thought I was dying
You boys know I'm not a religious man
But I sent a prayer out just in case, never know
You know almost immediately I have has reason to believe
That my prayer had been heard in a very special place
But this is what happened, I heard this sound

Ooooo
Yes
Oooo
Yes
Ooooo
It was harps and angels
Harps and angels
Coming near
I was too sick to roll over and see 'em
But I could hear them singing
Ever so beautifully in my ear

Then the sound began to subside
And then sound like background singers
This voice come down
From the heaven above
Was a voice full of anger from the Old Testament
A voice full of love from the new one
It was priestly love
Like it was the middle of the day

And I laid there quietly
Listening to what that voice had to say
You ain't been a good man
You ain't been a bad man
But you've been pretty bad
Lucky for you, this ain't you're time
Someone very dear to me as made another clerical error
And we're here on a bit of wild goose chase
But I want to tell you a few things 
That'll hold you in good stead
When it is your time
So you better listen close
I'm only going to say this once

[Chorus:]
Lay you on the table
Keep your business clean
Lay you on the table
Keep your business clean

Don't want no backstabbing
Ass grabbing, you know exactly what I mean
Alright girls go outta  here

Encore, encore
He spoke French
Tres bien
Encore
And off they went into the night
Almost immediately I felt better
Now I'm round here to see you boys
'Cause you know we ain't living right
And while it was fresh
I wanted to tell you
What he told me
He said

[Chorus:]
Yes there won't be no harps and angels
Coming for you
Will be trombones, kettles drums
Pitch forks and tambourines

Sing it like they did for me
Yes
Beautiful
Wish I spoke French
So actually the main thing about this story is, for me
There really is an after life
And I hope to see all of you there

Do you remember me
Should've told you

I get over losing anything

Funny story about that

Now I used to pitch
I could get the ball over the plate
Anyway this one time
Must have thrown a football round or something the day before
I walked about fourteen kids in a row
Cried, walked off the mound
Handed the ball to the third baseman
And just left the field

Anyway many years later
I brought the woman who was to become my second wife
God bless her
To meet my father for the first time
They exchanged pleasantries
I left the room for a moment
This is first time he met her, you understand
When I came back
He's telling her the story
Right off the bat
About how I walked fourteen kids
Cried and left the mound

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

To this great arena
Durham, North Carolina
The heart of the research triangle
We've come to this particular place tonight
We've gotta look at things from every angle
We need some answers to some complicated questions
If we're going to get it right
To that end we have here gathered 
Some of the most expensive scientists in the world
Eminent scientists, that is
We got biologists, biometricians
We got a quantum mechanic and astrophysicians
We got a cosmologist and cosmeticians
We got an astronaut, we got an astroboy

We got he-doctors, she-doctors
Knee doctors, tea doctors
We got a lumberjack and a life coach

On the other side, we have the true believers
We got the Baptists, the Methodists, the Presbyterians
Episcopalians are here, pass the hat
We got the Sugars, the Quakers
The anti innoculators
The big-boss line from Madison Town
The Six Blind Boys, Five Tons of Joy
Give 'em room or get outta the way
We got a Bible-belter from the Mississippi delta
Have them all arraigned

Scientists, are you ready?
First question
Dark matter
Ooh, dark matter
Get me someone who knows somethin' about space
Nice space music, Georgie
Alright, what is it?
Where is it?
Can we get some?
Stand up sir, what's your-
You are standing, forgive me
Dark matter, go ahead

Dark matter is out in space
It's seventy-five percent of everything
Just a moment, sir
Do yourself a favor, use our music, people like it and
Your music's making people sick
Alright, it's a free country
Go ahead with dark matter, what is it?
We don't know what it is
But we think it's everywhere
I'll take a look at it
Can we get someone down here?
Of course not!

Let me get this straight
You don't know what it is
You don't know where it is
And we can't get any
Put that to the one side
Let's put the Lord, faith, eternity

Next one is going to be a hard one
It's about the theory of evolution
And it's about animals also
So get me someone who knows somethin' about evolution and animals
Who you got?

Woah
You're a beautiful woman, aren't you?
It doesn't matter of course
This science thing doesn't work out for you
Don't boo me, don't boo me 
I'm just kidding, you know that
Here's my question
Explain me the giraffe
Go ahead
Elaborate with pleasure, miss
The giraffe, to survive, must eat leaves high up on the Yabba Yabba tree
That's true, isn't it?
Of course it is, everyone knows that
But Mr. Darwin's giraffe, a half-way giraffe, with a half-way giraffe neck
Could never reach the highest branches of the Yabba Yabba 
Therefore, it could not have survived
It's only common sense
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Charles Darwin didn't have any common sense
Evolution is a theory
And we have just now, tonight, disproved it
Show of hands

I'll take Jesus everytime

I'll take Jesus everytime

Yes, I would
Yes, I would
I'll take Jesus everytime

Next question, global warming
Is it? And if so, so what?
One the true believers seems to be recognized
Hand over a mic, Charles
Thank you

Sir, you know what you are
You're an idiot
You're a strong man, a fabrication
You see, the author of this little vignette, Mr. Newman
Self-described atheist and communist
Creates characters like you as objects of ridicule
He doesn't to believe anything he has you say
Nor does he want us to believe anything you say
Makes it easy for him to knock you down, hence a strong man
I myself, believe in Jesus
I believe in evolution also
I believe in global warming 
And in life everlasting
No one can knock me down

Oh, we can knock you down, mister
We can knock your communist friend down, too
Communist? He called me an idiot
We've been knocking people like Mr. Newman down for years and years

Being a man named Sonny Boy
Might bother you, it never bothered me none
My mother loved me, my wife did too

Like ""Good Morning School Girl"" and ""Jackson Blue""
Around the time of the great migration
The blues run up the river, spread across the nation
I run up with 'em caused a great sensation
Selling biscuits on the radio in Chicago
Out on the Westside to see the sights
Turned a corner, see my name in lights
Said I'd been playin' there for fourteen nights
This I had to see
This big old ugly cat was on the stage
Twice my size, about my age
Played six songs, five were mine
If I said he was good I'd be lyin'

The crowd says ""Sonny Boy!""
He says ""What's my name?""
They go ""Sonny Boy!""
And he says ""What's my name?""
I said ""Hold it,
My name is Sonny Boy Williamson
The one from Jackson, Tennessee
Don't know who you are
Or where you come from
But one thing I do know
You ain't me, son""
I looked in his eyes
And they was red
As was the rangtang hair dye
All over his head
Scared me so bad I ran outside
Looked for a place to hide
Ran 'round a corner
Smack into a robbery
They were shootin' each other
But they hit me
Next thing I know I came up here
In the middle of my thirty-fourth year

Now I'm the only bluesman in heaven
It makes me kind of sad
I know only one
Died so young
Didn't have the time
To do nothing bad
As for Sonny Boy Two
The man who stole my name
He went on to glory, fortune and fame
He's the one who went to England
Tried to teach those English boys the blues
He said what do I have to lose?
Well, it killed him
Yeah, it killed him

I'm the only bluesman in heaven
And I'm lonely as can be
Lord, if you're listening
Hear my plea
Send down a bluesman
To play the blues with me

This is Sonny Boy Williamson
Number One
That's my story
I'm done",Sonny Boy
Randy Newman,"Thank you for the party
I was glad we came
I'm the only from the family to make it
But I know they'd say the same
I came here with my father
And I brought my wife
Three sons, a daughter
And a last baby boy
A little caboose we call the light of our life
And that's who I'm waiting for

Where is my wandering boy tonight?
Where is my wandering boy?
If you see him, push him towards the light
Where is my wandering boy?

He went over that harbor there
When he was five years old
Laughing like a maniac
Shining in the sun like gold
He was afraid of nothing then
He was loved by everyone
I see it clear as I see you
That day there in the sun

I hope he's warm and I hope he's dry
And that a strangers eye is a friendly eye
And I hope he has someone close by his side
And I hope that he'll come home

Randy Owen,"She could be the first female president
Or be the doctor whose experiment
Finds the cure to what she's in here for
But right now treatments keep her sick in bed
That baseball cap never leaves her head
And while she sleeps I sit and dream

One day I ask her what do you wanna do
When you grow up
I soon found out I wasn't dreaming big enough

She said, I'm gonna ride my bike, I'm gonna climb a tree
Gonna fly a kite, score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again
Take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair

She could question God, Lord, knows I would
She could just give up
I don't think I could be that strong or fight so long
How can such a little girl have such big faith
And even through the pain she still prays
Saying, God will make a way

For me to ride my bike, for me to climb a tree
I'm gonna fly a kite and score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again
And take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair

She was crying at the fleetwood fair
Now shes laughing and tossing her hair
Cause she loves you like I never broke her heart

Never made her cry
Never told a lie, crossed the line or pushed too hard
I never slammed the door
Or made her walk the floor
I wonder where I went when I went too far
She loves you like I never broke her heart

At the time I didn't know
Just what I had til she let go
Of me and fell right into your arms
So ill turn away if she looks at me

'Cause I've got nothing to prove
And there's nothing left for me to lose
Nothing more to me than just a memory
Go out every night.
Up 'till the morning light
Having the time of my life
When I see you out with him
All I can do is grin
Glad it's not me whose missing out
When that sun goes down
You can find me out painting the town
Drinking away what used to be
'Cause I've got nothing to prove
And there's nothing left for me to lose
Nothing more to me than just a memory

The man I've become just ain't the same
Wanted to run but there's just no where to go
Livin' in a dream world, praying that it don't show.

Is who you want me to be
But I'm havin' a hard time finding me

Won't you let me go 
Got to do this by myself

Telling myself that I'm a damn fool

You're smiles still as bright as it's ever been
You won't show your eyes, scared that they might
Show all the world what you told me last night

And you're so tired of just being alive
You're so sad you could just cry

I'd sing you the sweetest songs and hold you so long
And make you forget all the reasons
You talked about leaving this place
If you're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

You seem pretty calm for what you have done
You're always rehearsed, you impress everyone
You're covered so well that no one can tell
Your skin is on fire and your heart is in hell

And you're so tired of just being alive
You're so sad you could just cry

I'd sing you the sweetest songs and hold you so long
And make you forget all the reasons
You talked about leaving this place
You're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

If you got to go, then you oughta know
I won't stand in your way
Just give me time and I'll change you mind
Soon you'll forget yesterday

Sing you the sweetest songs and hold you so long
And make you forget all the reasons
You talked about leaving this place
If you're thinking about leaving
I could give you a reason to stay

A reason to stay, won't you stay with me tonight
A reason to stay, won't you stay with me one more time

Randy Rogers,"It didn't matter Tommy Jackson was running free
Cause the man he killed never mattered much to me
There's talk in our town about where Tommy might run
Wondered if it mattered, he has used my gun

80 Miles East of the line down on my grand daddy's farm
He laid low just for the night and he slept there in our barn
I watched him steal our Ford and drive away in the sun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run

[Chorus]
Isn't love a funny thing with a pistol in your hand
Close you eyes and bow your head to pray if you can
Well you sealed your fate when you picked up that shotgun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run, on the run

For 15 days Tommy kept his conscience between the lines
His ex-wife and a cold jail cell were always on his mind
He ran out of cash at an east-bound truck stop
But he found work there at Fritz's muffler shop
Fritz was a good man and Pamela was his wife
2 kids a nice home and on the surface a good life
But drunk on Whiskey Pam and Tommy had some fun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run

[Chorus]

Now every Sunday morning she goes down to the place where he lays
She tells Tommy how she never wanted things this way

Cause it's been six long days and I'm on my way
Will I ever see the end?
I've got a heavy load down a dead end road
And I can't sleep again, no I can't sleep again

Hold the phone now, hold the phone now
You're calling again, why won't you call again?

Say my name little girl, say my name little gir

It will be easy when I'm not around

This path the road leads me down
Ain't the same one others see

I can't tell the sky from the ground
It's wrong, but it's right
It's gonna be another long night
I can see the lights of the next town
And I can't slow down

It was good to be back home
When you left I got drunk alone
I let the whiskey burn a hole
Right through you and me

But I'm too scared to put it down

I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've been walking in circles, all my life 
Chasing my own tail 
I've got a penny in my pocket but the rest of my change 
Is down at the bottom of the well 
I've got my mind made up but what I can't figure out 
Is how am I gonna leave my mark 
When all I've got left is doubt 

I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've wasted my time all these years 
Just looking for a little bit more 
But it's hard to keep your shoes clean 
When all you've got is dirt on the floor 
And I've hit rock bottom with some good friends of mine 
We sat and watched the sun rise but we never saw it shine 

There's a man on the radio says he's got it all worked out 
He's got a show on the road but he don't know 
What it's all about

Randy Rogers,"3 a.m. and I'm all alone, try to call but I doubt you're home. Not much has changed here on my end. Sure would be good to see you again. I know we had our fights. Nothing since has felt that right. Lived my life from day to day. If I don't think too much everything is okay.

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. with me.

I still drive that same ol' car, still work at that run down bar. Still hang out with that same group of guys, and on Saturday nights, still go that dive. Been two months since I had a drink. Damn good for me, don't you think? Oh, its been a year now since you've gone. Oh I've tried my best, I can't move on..

Cause' I miss holding your hand. Miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep. Guess I just miss you with me..

If you give me a second chance, I'll never let you go. Swallowed all my pride and now I got a let you know..

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. I guess I miss you.. with me.

Randy Rogers,"It's funny how some people dream
They put on a show just to be on the scene
I don't know how many times I've stood right here
And you still don't see me
It may be wrong but tonight I'm gonna see those city lights
Cause it sure as hell beats lying here
Wishing I was on your mind

So tonight I'm walking and you started talking
About what you said we would never be
Oh and I've been worried it's the same old story I never know if you're gonna leave
I say it's the last time, just like I always do
I give you another chance and I lay it all on you

I caught myself out drifting
I guess sometimes it's good to be alone
Like a lonely gypsy I've got nothing to prove
And no one to call my own
I know there are people watching
Waiting for my next move
Yeah but they can't see that I'm too busy

It comes creepin in, deeper than I have ever known
And I don't know if you know it, but it's catching up with me
It's gonna track you down

I've been running with my heart wide open
I know I'm not always what you need

Tear ourselves all apart just so we could make up

You could've left me before you did me wrong

That's right, it's too late
Yeah, I left a long time ago
You were too busy living it up

Now don't act so sad
Those tears aren't even real
You ain't ever gonna see me again

Just like I knew you would

But I've got the road less traveled
My dreams unraveled
A broken heart that suits me fine
Yeah, my load's a little lighter from a string of all-nighters
A bottle for killin' time
Honey, you start over your way, yeah, and I'll start over mine

If you're here to make amends
I'll let you rub it in
But I'm not gonna play the fool
Yeah, 'cause even if the rumors were true I could never tell you

Don't know why things keep going right for me
All I've ever done is run wild and free
I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be

Well, I guess I must've done something right
Some other time or place, maybe some other life
There's no way I deserve how I've been blessed
If it was up to me I'd still be a mess

'Cause I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be
Don't know why things keep going right for me

I just wanna keep living this dream
Oh, I could never make up
Anything as good as what's happening to me

Well, I try my best but I can do no wrong
Blues come my way but they never stay long
I thought I had it all when I didn't have a buck
Now it ain't easy having all the luck

And you're looking for someone who can dance
I'll be right over there by the jukebox, a quarter in my hand

So I rehearsed my lines
Said I ain't looking for trouble
Well, I know you came in here with him tonight

Randy Rogers,"Peace of mind combined with everything you didn't say
Leaves me lonely only for the night and everyday
You always run away from me and I run away from you

It's all the same, I'm ashamed it had to turn out this way
Now every time reminds me how it's all a big cliche
You always run away from me and I run away from you

And I wish this time you would be mine for good
But the reason why you never stay is you say
You didn't know you could

Didn't know you could turn back right then
And spend your life with someone you just let go

A once in a lifetime blind love never saw the light of day
It cost us forever for better or for worse
That's the price we pay

And I wish this time you would be mine for good
But the reason why you never stay is you say
You didn't know you could

And you always ran away from me and I always knew you would
And you say the reason why you never stayed

Randy Rogers,"A hand-me-down hot rod holding down the interstate
Life in the fast lane, staying out too late
Drunk on summertime, crazy and hard to hold

A car full of dreamers parked in the parking lot
Waiting on the world and some girls was a long shot
Life was a drug and we were hooked, we didn't know

We'll never be that high again, stoned out our minds on innocence
Used to catch a buzz on the fact that it was Saturday night
We'll never be that high again, tell me why did it have to end
You're only young once but man you're not too old to try
But you know you'll never be that high

I'll always remember when I met Jim Bean
Everybody laughed pretty hard at the first drink
Barely got it down, thought I'd drowned when it took a hold

It hit me like a train to the brain feeling real tall
Twenty minutes later Jim hit me like a brick wall
Never felt as good as the first time that whiskey flowed

We'll never be that high again, stoned out our minds on innocence

But the next one's the same as before
The trail's so damn rocky and the Sun's so damn hot
I don't know where I'm headed anymore
it's hard to remember the first time I drew my gun
The faces return in the night
The past is all echoes and shadows anymore
I think I lost my taste for the fight

That is the fate of the old desperado
Better the angels to claim you than a long ride alone
Someone would have long ago found El Dorado
So luck to you, cowboy, I'm movin' on

Play your cards as they lay on the table
Should've ended a long time ago
The only place that ever really mattered to me
Was the one place I just couldn't go
And the stars, when they shine, how they light up the night
Smell the rain comin' in on the wind
Though my eyes are so heavy, I remember tonight
When the world was just waitin' to begin

That is the fate of the old desperado
Better the angels to claim you than a long ride alone
Someone would have long ago found El Dorado

But the easy will blind you, the road will unwind you
Remind you of how far you've gone

Some 15 years ago
We had us a hell raising time
So we took it on the road
Broke and damn near homeless
Lost and stumbling around
But I think that when you struggle
That’s when you find your sound

I’ve seen love come and go
Lost some friends along the way
Had nobody at our shows
And nights we didn’t get paid
There’s been bar tabs and b.s
Choices, good and bad
But it’s all part of the story and the damn good luck we’ve had

Well we’re not sure how we got here
But somehow we stuck around
Some days I feel like we can fly
And some days I think we’ll drown
I guess what they say is true
All you need is one good friend
And in the next life, we wanna be ourselves again

Buddy what was it like to play the Opry?
Well, you tell me man, you’ve been there
You know I had to have a few drinks of courage
Yeah, me too, I was nervous as hell
And remember the Houston Rodeo
The time I opened up for The King
Yeah, man we made some damn fine memories
I know, sometimes it’s hard to believe

I'm not sure how we got here
But somehow we stuck around
Some days I feel like we can fly
Some days I think we’ll drown
I guess what they say is true
All you need is one good friend
And in the next life, we wanna be ourselves again

My daddy is a hell raising, good timing man
I was born the son of a preacher singing all those hymns
Got a little of both mixed up, somewhere in these songs
But right or wrong, I know they’re proud of what we have become

I can't say we've had a good morning

Randy Rogers,"Reasons to quit
The smoke and booze don't do me like before
I'm hardly ever sober
My old friends don't come around much anymore
Reasons to quit
The low is always lower than the high
The reasons to quit
Don't outnumber all the reasons why

So we keep smokin' and we keep drinkin'
Havin' fun, never thinkin'
Laughin' at the price tags that we pay
We keep roarin' down the fast lane
Like two young men feelin' no pain
And the reasons for quittin' are gettin' bigger each day

Reasons to quit
I can't afford the habit all the time
I need to be sober
I need to write some new songs that will rhyme
Reasons to quit
You have no rhyme or reason when you're high
And the reasons to quit
Don't outnumber all the reasons why

We keep smokin' and we keep drinkin'
Havin' fun and never thinkin'
Laughin' at the price tags that we pay
We keep roarin' down the fast lane

He said I got some songs for you
There's one about a dirt road, I really think you outta' do
So I gave it a listen
And it wasn't all that bad
But it ain't me, so I shook my head
And that's all there is to that

I don't have hits
I've got standards
Tell me how can I sell out?
If I barely sell at all
You won't see my name on the billboard
Every night I pack the dance floor
There's your answer
I don't have hits, I've got standards

He just smiled, he rolled his eyes
He said ""how can I make you see?""
We just need one big hit
And the rest will be history
If we could find a way to compromise
You could be the next big star
I said ""man you might be right,
But I don't care if you are""

'Cause I done lost my woman
And I need a night out

Said I can't burn it down
'Cause I'm gettin' up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sittin' at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hittin' on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy

Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money

Did I crash a party
Have a run in with the law
Take a swim in a fountain
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

There's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants

Who the hell is Heather
And when were we together
'Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
A cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm

It's fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money

Did I call my momma
Try to break into the mall
Did I even pay the cabbie
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

I remember how it started
After that it's just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday
Am I suppose to be at work

It's fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny

Will the room stop spinning
Will I find my car
On my way back home right now

We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow

And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go

Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",Me and My Shadow

For everything that love could bring you brought me

Randy Sandke,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love","In a Mist, Candlelight [Bonus Track]"

Randy Sandke,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

That love's young dream never comes true,

Randy Scott,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Randy Scruggs,"Ridin' on the city of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday mornin' rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors, twenty-five sacks of mail
Out on the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kakakee
And it rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no name
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't nobody keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magic carpet make of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans

Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home and we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings that song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues

Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true, true love never dies

The first time I thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turnin'
Yeah, there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesome is not surely passin'
That ol' true, true love never dies

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale emanita and hyssop so blue

A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning no words of farewell
I will dance I will sing and my life shall be gay
I will charm every heart in the crowd I will sway
Though my heart is now breaking he never shall know
How his name makes me tremble my pale cheeks to glow
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour

To get to you 

Well I give anything if I had you forever 
I'd give anything to see that time 
Well I walk upon my hands up the stairway to heaven 
Anything to make you mine

Anything, anytime 
Day or night, rain or shine 
There ain't nothin' I won't do 
To get to you",Anything
Randy Travis,"You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killin'
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen

They say time take its toll on a body
Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen

As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen","Forever and Ever, Amen"
Randy Travis,"Mama always prayed that I'd be a better man than daddy
And I determined not to let her down
Deserted by the man she loved and left to raise four children
We were the local gossip of the town.

I promised her that I'd live right and not be like the others
But I wound up in jail on Christmas day
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers
When I got home my mom had passed away

(chorus)
And I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions
And mama my intentions were the best
There's lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention
Looks like I've turned out like all the rest
But mama my intentions were the best

A little boy with big blue eyes a-beggin' to go fishing
I promised him but never took the time
Now they won't let me see him and I sit here a-wishing
Wishin' I could hold him one more time

(repeat chorus)
But mama my intentions were the best",Good Intentions
Randy Travis,"You're my always and forever
You're the one that hung the moon
After all these nights together
I still get lost in your perfume
And if I could write a love song
Every line would tell the truth
It would be a warm and soft one
And my heart would say to you

When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over
I won't need you anymore

Oh, the feelings lay so easy
Lyin' here the way we are
No one else could ever hold me
Like the heavens hold the stars

When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over

I won't need you anymore
I won't need you anymore",I Won't Need You Anymore
Randy Travis,"My house is no mansion
But it still holds my treasures
Things that will never be sold
There's a few things in this world
That just can't be measured
By money, by silver and gold

My house is filled with the things that I love
From her smile in the mornin'
To her soft goodnight hugs
Her whisper, her laughter
Everything that she does
My house is filled with the things that I love

This old bed that we sleep on
Don't have satin covers
But it holds some great memories
No decorations can make better lovers
In her arms I feel like a king
My house is filled with the things that I love
From her smile in the mornin'
To her soft goodnight hugs
Her whisper, her laughter
Everything that she does
My house is filled with the things that l love
Yes, my house is filled with the things that I love",My House
Randy Travis,"Tonight were gonna tear down the walls		
 Were gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball	
 The good times ain't over after all
 And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls	
 It seems we let the hard times come between us	
 Like a wall around our hearts we couldn't see	
 Hard luck and trouble came rainin down upon us		
 They almost got the best of you and me
 Once we loved to stay at home and make love	
 Now work is all we ever seem to do	
 We been spendin too much time makin money
 I think its time we had a laugh or two
 Tonight were gonna tear down the walls		
 Were gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball

 And Ill polish that ol truck until it shines

 Just leave hard luck and troubles far behind

Randy Travis,"Everybody said I'd leave you
They gave us six months to a year
Said our love would just fall pray to
The jukebox, women and the beer
They want to get those rumours flyin'
They're watchin' for a rendez-vous
But if they ever say I'm cheatin'
They'll be lyin'

The fire and the wine and the touch of a man
But fell in love and ruined all your plans
Now what'll you do about me

Imagine the faces on your high class friends
When I beat on the door and I beg to come in 
Screamin ""Come On Love me again""
Now what'll you do about me

Well you can change your number 
You can change your name
You can ride like hell on the midnight train
That's alright Momma that's okay
But What'll you do about me

Picture your neighbors when you try to explain
That good ol' boy standin' out in the rain
With his nose on window pain
Now what'll you do about me

What in the world are you planning to do
When a man comes over 
Just to visit with you
And I'm on the porch with a 2'2
Lady what will you do about me

Well you can call youer lawyer 
You can call yeah 'cause
You can sound the alarm wake the neighbors up
Ain't no way to stop a man in love
Now what'll you do about me

All you wanted was a one night stand
The fire and the wine and the touch of a man
But fell in love and baby here I am

Randy Travis,"The writing is on the wall, baby
We're different as day and night
But I guess that I refused to face it
The blues in black and white

When I got home I knew, baby
Something was wrong tonight 
When I found the note you wrote ,it gave 
The blues in black and white

[Chorus]
Color my world without you in it 
And the future don't look too bright 
Darlin' its not a pretty picture 
The blues in black and white

Since you've been gone I'm going crazy 
I've got to get on with my life
Maybe I'll write a book and call it 
The blues in black and white

Randy Travis,"If I'd have been all you ever wanted
I wonder how much better I'd be
And I know you think it's over
'Cause you're so far away
But darlin' you're still here with me

And I will hold you always
No matter how far we're apart
You could be anywhere in the world tonight
But I'd still have you here in my heart

I don't try to forget you, don't cry over regrets
And I always know right where you are
So I'll be happy just to hold you
Here in my heart
Till I have you back in my arms

Randy Travis,"Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doing' fine

Is it still over are we still through
Since my phone still ain't ringing
I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not sure that I'm still over you

That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do

Is it still over are we still through
Since my phone still ain't ringing
I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not sure that I'm still over you

Is it still over are we still through
Since my phone still ain't ringing
I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not sure that I'm still over you

If I repeat myself it's 'cause I've nothing else to do
But I'm not sure that I'm still over you",Is It Still Over?
Randy Travis,"I'll just turn away, there's not need to watch her leaving
I don't want to let her see me cry
And the part of me that's breaking
Is The part that has been taking her for granted
And that's why she said goodbye

I twas me that let her down and left her lonely
But her leaving me was never in my plan
It started with my lying
And it ended with me crying
And she's taken all the lonely she can stand

It's out of my hands now
It's over and done
She's made her choice now
And I'm not the one
She'll find her future with some other man
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see
Now it's out of my hands.

She tried every way she knew to make me happy
She was more than just a lover and a friend
I was just too blind to see
And now she set me free
So it's best to walk away and let it end

It's out of my hands now
It's over and done
She's made her choice now
And I'm not the one
She'll find her future with some other man
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see
Now it's out of my hands.



",It's Out of My Hands
Randy Travis,"Well know it ain't much
But it's all that I have since she's gone

One black and white memory
Of the only love I've ever known
One moment in time
When we were together
A page from the past 
To haunt me forever
A constant reminder that hearts heal much slower than bones

[Chorus:]
Now my whole world's in one 8x10
With 4 metal walls holding it in
Through one plate glass window 
'neath a blanket of dust
Stands an 8x10 picture of us

I wish I'd have told her what I felt inside
Back when her sweet love was growing like wine
I wish she'd come back and love me again 
The way that she loved me in that old 8x10

Now the silence I deaf'ning
As the date turns to dark
Her presence gets stronger with each beat of my heart

I pretend that she's here
And we've made a new start
And for a moment 
She's back in my arms

[Chorus]
There's an 8x10 picture of us",Old 8 X 10
Randy Travis,"Cheap perfume and painted faces
Fallen angles fill the places 
Where I go when my troubles pull me down
All the lies I know they'll tell me
And the time that they will sell me 
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town
Back at home in bed she's crying
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pry I make it safely through the night
When the mornin' sun starts showing 
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light 

And I'll make promises 
Promises to change 
I'll make her promises swear I'll rearrange 
And I'll start giving all the love she needs 
If only she will stay
Once again she'll reassure me and 
I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord I know she's just a woman 
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know she'll 
Leave without a trace
For broken' promises 
Will tear her dreams apart
Just token promises will someday break her heart
And for the last time she'll hold me when I cry 
And while I'm sleeping
She'll quietly say goodbye",Promises
Randy Travis,"You can throw away my picture, empty out my dresser drawer
Break up all the dishes, change the lock on the door 
But you can't erase my memory, no matter how you try
It don't mean its over, just because you said goodbye
I'm sorry that I hurt you, but you made me so mad
If I don't care about you, why do I feel so bad
We're almost out of sugar, and our matches got wet 
But we ain't out of love yet

We ain't out of love yet lets not do something hasty,baby,that we'll regret
Our lovin' cup ain't empty, there's still plenty left
We ain't out of love yet

We might run out of gas and be left out in the rain
Could run out of cigarettes or money again
A little out of touch or just plain out of our heads
But we ain't out of love yet

We ain't out of love yet 
Lets not do something hasty, baby, that we'll regret
Our lovin' cup ain't empty there's still plenty left
We ain't out of love yet

And with just a little mending we can have a happy ending
Lets forgive and forget
We don't need a lawyer now we just need a rest 
Then we can get back into doin' what we do best
Was Scarlett ever through with Rhett
You can't break up a perfect set 
And we ain't out of love yet",We Ain't out of Love Yet
Randy Travis,"I'm gonna take you down to the riverside
Where the water runs slow and wide
There's a big ole rock out in the middle
And I took my hammer and chisel

And worked all night so you could see
Just how much you mean to me
I carved your name right next to mine
And it'll be there till the end of time
And my love will last at least that long

It's written in stone how I feel for you
It's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be 100
Or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know how I feel for you
Is written in stone

There's a place on the edge of town
When I was a kid I found
Two names on a stone together
Lying side by side forever

And it was then and there I knew
If I ever thought a love was true
I'd surely want to write it down
On something that would be around
When all the spoken words have come and gone

It's written in stone how I feel for you
It's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be 100
Or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you
Is written in stone

And when this life has come and gone
Our love will still be
Written in stone how I feel for you
Written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and life hereafter loving you

And darling if we live to be 100
Or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know how I feel for you
Is written in stone",Written in Stone

Carolers are singing
Snowflakes drifting through the air

How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?
I want to give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Won't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do

At first I thought of giving you a pretty golden ring
Wore myself out shopping for a million other things
Finally decided on something you can't buy
But how will I disguise it so you will be surprised?

How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?
I want to give it to you

Won't fit the gift I'm givin'

The gift of love was given to the world so long ago
Lying in a manger he was wrapped in swaddling clothes
Every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above
And give to one another our little gifts of love
