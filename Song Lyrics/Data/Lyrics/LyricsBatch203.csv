Johnnie Taylor,"I am somebody, yeah
You are somebody, yeah

A lawyer is somebody
Though he loses every
Case that he pleads
A doctor is still somebody
Thought he gives out
The wrong remedy

Now, I may not have shoes
To put on my feet
I may not have

Alright, now, I`ll tell you
I am somebody
Every man and
Woman is somebody

Though you`re up in society
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

Without everyday people like me

You can make it
Watch me make it
Watch me make it
I`m gonna make it

I am somebody, yeah
You are somebody

Old Martin was somebody
Before he ever started
The March on Washington
Old Bobby was somebody
Before his campaign for
President begun

You may not have a place
To lay your head
The clothes on your back
They do nothing but shred
But you are somebody
Every man is somebody

There`s some good in every man
Give him respect and
Give him a chance
And surely, surely
He`ll understand

Johnnie Taylor,"I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry

I feel for sorry
For any man out there
When he can't look around
And say this is my woman
My woman alone

I feel sorry, yeah
For any woman out there
Who can't say I got somebody
That I can call my very own

I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry

One thing I can say about
The people of the world today
They see you with a good thing
They want to take it away

But I believe in you
You believe in me too, yeah
Even your best friend will come
Around making sly remarks
Trying to put you down
I believe in you
You believe in me too

Listen, honey
People talking
Trying to pull us apart
Sticking pins and needles
In both of our hearts
I love you no matter
Don't care about
The stormy weather

I heard your mother say
Loving me didn't make no sense
But when she put me down
You stood up in my defense

I believe in you
Anytime you against
Your own mother
It makes me know
You believe in me, yeah
Here's another thing

We had our hard times
And almost didn't make it
We always worked it
Never tried to fake it

But I believe in you
You believe in me too
Here's anything about it

People talking
Trying to pull us apart
Always ticking pins and
Needles in both of our hearts
Our love together
Don't care about
The stormy weather

I believe in you
You believe in me too, yeah

I believe
That's why every time
We get a chance
I tell you, honey
How much I love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you

And most of all
How much I trust you
The reason why I trust you, baby
Is because of one thing
I can lean on you, yeah, baby
And you can lean on me too
One more time I'm gonna say

I believe in you
Honey, please
Let me believe in you
I know a lot of folk out there
Wish they had somebody
They could believe in

I believe, I believe in you
You believe in me too

Your own mother

To know you believe in me too",I Believe in You (You Believe in Me)
Johnnie Taylor,"If I became President
I know I won't last a day
I would lower all the taxes

I'd bring home all the fellers
From over in Vietnam
Station them around your door
So the world can't do you no harm

Don't you know, I'd place Presidential
Powers in your hand

Congress would veto the first bill
I would pass
First would be, ?Tear the White House down
Build you a house of glass?

And stake out the Navy
On every downtown street

Johnnie Taylor,"Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Baby, listen

I don't wanna lose you
As a matter of fact
I can't stand to lose you

When I say I love you, yeah
This time, you can believe me
Yes, you can

I can't blame you
If you wanna leave me, no, no
After all, I'm the one
Who deceived you

But I'm just here
To let you know
Never, ever, will I
Want to let you go

I don't wanna lose you

Let me, let me, let me say it

You saw me running
Around with another
But the next time
They'll never, no, never
Log on to kill this message

'Cause the love in my heart is so true
No one else will ever do
If you say we're gonna part
Don't you know you're gonna break J T's heart

I don't wanna lose you
Oh, the sweet loving you give me
I don't wanna lose you
(Baby)

Don't let the memory
That we shared fade away
Reconsider my new love and devotion
'Cause I can honestly say

My love is real
I'm gonna make you feel it
My love is real, baby
I want you to have it

If I lose your love
It'll be like taking the
Sun out of the sky, baby

If I lose, if I lose, if I lose
If I lose, if I lose
If I lose your love, honey
Where can a man go from here?

Oh, no, I don't wanna
Go on without you

I can't live, listen to my heartbeat
It's beating kind of slow
You just broke my heart when you told me
John, I don't love you no more

Tell me one more time
Take me in your arm
Tell me anything can be alright
Tell me that you love me, tell

Hold on to my
Oh, hold on, hold on, baby
I don't wanna lose you
You got to hold it, hold it

Johnnie Taylor,"I've been born again
I'm a brand new man (kind of brand new)
I've been born again
Saturday night in the city
Parties on every block
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party
But my party days had to stop
So brothers you can keep your street life
Changin' women like you change your clothes
'Cause every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one
My love just grows and grows

Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips

I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
Oh, I'm not a casanova
My playin' days are over

I think I'm gonna start me a fire
Got my matchbox in my hand
Burnin' up the pages in my little black book
Start my life all over again
I don't need no women in excess
I can't afford to spread my lovin' around
Cause when my woman, she's needin' me by her side
I just don't wanna let her down

Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip

Just to prove my manhood
I got me one special woman

Johnnie Taylor,"Every guy I know
Trying to get ahead
Working two jobs
Til you're almost dead
(You tell em)

Work your fingers
Right down to the bone
There's a cat named Jody
Sneaking around in your home

There's a cat named Jody
In every town
Spending lots of cash
And just riding around

Ride on, Jody
Ride on, ride on

Footprints on your carpet

To sleep in your bed
Sit down at the table
Eat your bread

After working hard all day
Jody's got your girl
And he don't play

To make the money grow

Mister foreman, I think we
Better make a compromise
If you keep me any longer
It won't be too wise

My baby thinks I'm
Fooling with another ?
Now fire me if you wanna

Going on home
You take like James Brown
You better check on your love bone
And you, Wilson Pickett
You better get on the telephone
And check at home

Gave me that time 634-5789
You better call it right now
And check on your love bone

One night only in Soul Heaven
I didn't wanna wake up
I was having such a good time
All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage
Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing ""A Change Gonna Come""
Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay

There was a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

Train & Miles (J. Coltrane,  took mean solo
Jr. Walker had 'em dancing in the isles
They stood up when Jackie sang ""Lonley Teardrops""
When Sammy (Davis, Jr.) danced, the crowd went wild
I think I saw Ella standing with Mahalia
Backstage with Elvis with his blue suede shoes
It started raining, everybody just stayed there
To hear Z.Z. sing the ""Down Home Blues""

When Marvin sang ""Let's Get It On"", they jumped to

Everyone started screaming and gave a standing ovation
When the curtain came up with the mighty Temptations
King Curtis blew the ""Soul Serenade""
Thought I saw Lady Day (B. Holiday) sittin' in the
shade
I got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Lord I love the way sweet Mary (Wells) sings
It was getting kinda late, it was time to go
Tupac and Biggie (Smalls), they closed the show

"Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson","Everybody rappin' and talkin' 'bout nothin' and makin' 'em sexy sounds 
And in the meantime and in-between-time I'm down here on the ground. 
But now, I'm not complainin' about what's pertainin' to my present status quo 
About things gettin' hard, ooh, my God – inflation… I know you know. Listen: 

Now just yesterday I'd like to say before I got on my bed. 
Now I was already tired on the for-real side and a few bills I'd have got to pay… 
Now my phone rang and a cute little girl began to sing this tune, 
She said: “Mr. Watson I'd like to inform you your phone is turned off at noon!” 

Now that came to me as no surprise, 'cause last week I went up the coast, 
I met a cute little girl that was all the way live and callin' her I thought was the most! 
She had them great big eyes and 'em great big legs and it gave my body a chill. 
So, you know, I never thought about the cost and, no – a telephone bill! 

So I just kept on rappin', my hands got clappin', havin' myself a ball, 
Eh, ah – you know, it slipped my mind it was at the same time I was makin' a long distance call. 
So that day before yesterday I ran into the problem just making them calls an hollers 
And I picked up the envelope that contained my bill – guess what: 500 dollars! 

Now, the next time I call this big-leg-cutie to make myself a date 
I'm gonna call that girl way after nine and get me the evening rate! 
Now, I ain't gonna tell her, shh, ain't gonna tell her nothin' to blow my frown thing, 
But it'll be way, way, way after nine when she'll hear her telephone ring! 

Ring it! Ring it! Ring that telephone! 
Ring it! Ring it! Ring that telephone! 
I said: ring it! Ring it! Have yourself a thrill! 
And when you ring it, ring it: watch your phone bill! 

Now I paid the bill and the deal was real and my talking resumed and all. 
A, ah, I said: from now on, pal, I must stick to my local calls! 
Now, a few weeks passed, and I would just guess – y-you know what I'm talkin' about – 
I say, when I got the bill the figure was so low, I was impressed! Knock me out! 

Now, shortly that after something stopped my laughter, I was upside diggin' in the yard, 
Heard a “ding” and I heard a “dong” – it was the phone! Ooh, my Lord! 
Say, I dropped my shovel and my body I levelled and I made me a 100-yard dash 
And then I straightened up my clothes and I blew my nose through a kleenex in the trash. 

I composed myself and I picked up the phone and I was still kinda huffin' and puffin' 
And the operator said “would you accept a collect call?” – I said: “Ain't that nothin'?” 
But, uh, I was just cool, 'cause, you know, I didn't wanna be no fool, and, see, I didn't know who it was – 
It was the big-legged cutie from up off the coast tellin' me that she was in love! 

Then, now, for three whole minutes I planned to talk – not now you all know I ain't never lied! 
But, in love or not, I planned to stop when the third minute arrived! 
I went three minutes past – it occured to me: ooh! She might talk a week! 
I-I said: “I'm sorry, Baby, look, I gotta go!” – She was a telephone freak! 

She said: “Oh, Johnny, talk a little longer! With you I'm so in love!” 
I said: “I know, where you're comin' from, I can dig it! I gotta go rehearse at the club!” 
She said: “Well, if you gotta go rehearse I'll call you later, there's some I gotta tell you what's on my mind!” 
I said: “Well, yeah okay, Baby, you can call me back – anytime after nine!” 

Ring it! Ring it! Ring that telephone! 
Why don't you ring it? Ring it? Ring that telephone? 
And when you ring it, ring it, have yourself a thrill! 
And ring it, ring it: watch your phone bill ",Telephone Bill

You're not the girl that I belong to
And even though I know it's wrong to
There's a little place where we can go
Where we won't run into a soul we know

Whoa, baby, baby
Well I wish I could get you out of my life
But my heart won't let you out of my life
Oh Baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you?
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you?

Sure I could tell you it's over and then
One day I'd call you and beg you to see me again
This is a fine mess I got myself in
And let me tell you, you ain't helpin' 
You know the changes I'm going through
But still you look at me the way you do

Girl you got me to fall in love with you
Though I'm not free to fall in love with you

I want to know
Why did I have to get so hung on you

Through the perishing
winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Where do you walk tonight?

Waiting for a crew of men so she can make her trip 
Out searching was the best gang that everyone knew well 
A-searchin' the streets & gutters so the Defiant could set sail 

The captain ordered to see the men to pick them for his crew 
Called for headstruck daughters but for all the good men too 
Out to sail this morning, Italy was her destiny 
To escort back a convoy that was helpless on the sea 

CHORUS:

There was no word of mutiny aboard, but who was there to blame? 

The Defiant reached its destiny, no timber ships in sight 
So returning home, the French approached; the Defiant had to fight 
She captured herself a vessel with a chest of jewels aboard 
Along with the Frenchmen who advised Napoleon under his sword 

With Captain Culvert wounded was there not a man to care 
The first lieutenant took command with mutiny in the air 
The breakout be with 2 men named Evans & Vazar 
Commanded the mutineers to take the ship where they desired

The English were surrounded by the French who came to fight 
With love for England the mutineers turned to fight with all their might

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

Johnny Cash,"Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all its land
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall
He had concubines and wives
He called his Babylon ""Paradise"" 
On his throne he drank and ate 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time
All holy things they scorned and mocked 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand 
Nothin' else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood 
Belshazzar asked him what it said 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your houses are built upon the sand""",Belshazzar

I guess the things will never be the same

Johnny Cash,"When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)",Are All the Children In
Johnny Cash,"Well the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky 
And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high

Cause I call him when I'm troubled and I call him when I'm weak 
And he always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe 
He'll be there (he'll be there) he'll be there (he'll be there)

Johnny Cash,"Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven 
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven 
My name was at the top and many things below 
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all) 
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah) 
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away 
And the old account was settled long ago 
Well the old account was large and growin' every day 
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray 
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe 
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees)...

Johnny Cash,"The years have been many the years have been long 
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home 
He's looking my way though he hardly can see 
God bless my old daddy he recognize me 
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there a halo of worry and care 
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold 
For I cherish the snow in his hair

We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known 
So don't forget when shadows gather 
The Lord our God is still the King upon his throne

And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat 
These things shall pass and life be sweeter 
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure 
These things shall pass so don't you worry

So hold up high and face your troubles 
And don't despair if you must face them all alone

Johnny Cash,"I live in the cemetery ol' caretaker they call me 
In the wintertime I rake the leaves and in the summer I cut the weeds 
When a funeral comes the people cry and pray 
They bury their dead and they all go away 
But through their grief I still can see their hate and greed and jealousy 
So here I work and I somehow hide from a world that rushes by outside 
And each night when I rest my head I'm contented as the peaceful death 
But who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies 
Once I was a young man dashing with the girls 
Now no one wants an old man I lost my handsome curls 
But I want to say when my time comes lay me facing the rising sun 
Put me in the corner where where I buried my pup 
Tell the preacher to pray then cover me up 
Don't lay flowers where my head should be maybe God let some grow for me 
And all the little children that I love like my own 
Will they be sorry that old John's gone 
Who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies",The Caretaker

Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan 
He told 'em this would be his last carousing 

I'm gonna settle down boys if I can (with my darling) Clementine

Concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded
On the pages of God's holy word

Desiring to lower her standards
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching
But really she makes no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing

On a cloud like He said in His word

Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down 
Went right home and I went to bed I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head 
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun took a transfusion and away I run 
Made a good run but I run too slow they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico 
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills in walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill 
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown 
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down 
Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee 
If you've got a warrant just a read it to me 
Shot her down because she made me slow 
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more 
When I was arrested I was dressed in black put me on a train and they took me back 
Had no friends for to go my bail they slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail 
Into the courtroom my trial began where I was handled by twelve honest men 
Just before the jury started out I saw the little judge commenced to look about 
In about five minutes in walked the man holding the verdict in his right hand 
Verdict read in the first degree I hollered Lowdy Lowdy have a mercy on me 
The judge he smiled as he picked up his ben 99 years in the San Quentin pen 
99 years underneath that ground I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine

I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of Heaven

Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in Heaven

Johnny Cash,"Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Johnny Cash,"On your knees you are taller than trees you can look over heartaches and pain 
When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees 
One night it was a long time ago now I knelt at my mother's knee 
And she said son lift up your eyes to him in the skies 
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks 
But you son created in image of God can become taller than the tallest trees 
And this was the answer I felt as down at her knees I knelt 
On your knees you're taller than trees 
You can look over all your heartaches and son you can look over all of your pains 
When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees",Taller Than Trees
Johnny Cash,"(When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
[ guitar ]
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down...

Johnny Cash,"There are those who are taking vacations to the mountains the lakes and the sea 
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles 
What a wonderful time that must be 
But it seems not my lot to be like them I must toil through the heat and the cold 
Seekin' out the lost sheep on the mountains bringing wanderers back to the fold 
But when I take my vacation in heaven what a wonderful time that will be 
Hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus and the face of my Saviour I'll see 
Sitting down on the banks of the river neath the shade of the evergreen tree 
There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me

""I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I""

Did they not stray did little lambs weep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep

And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out

Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went

Johnny Cash,"Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
Could a land know such a people
As the pioneer, the cowboy
His clothes, his conversation, his unique brand of lingo

All his devil deeds of daring
His hat, his bandana, the dirty boots
And ragged chaps
But mainly that sixgun dangling

So his hand could get it quickly
But draw your own conclusions
Lean to your own understandings
Your beliefs and your convictions

Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds
And songs and legends
But I ask you if you do be sure
You've walked in many moccasins

Over many, many pathways
And that you have listened carefully
Really listened to the west wind
And to everything it whispers

And then go back and listen, listen to this once more
To these legends and traditions
They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
Just ponder on the things that happened

As we gaze so very deeply
In the time and place and persons
Seeing now and then the West as it really was
And to tell you of a little that we saw there

And looking backward through a century
There was the True West there was the Real True West
Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
And saw it as we saw it

And heard that west wind screaming, shouting almost speaking
Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
And the legends and traditions

Through the wind that breeze these tales
Of the ones who never made it
Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys, snow and hunger
They went westward, westward, westward

When the lightnin' hit the leaders and the devil led the pack

Stampede they're comin' up to draw...

Our horses they were handy for we had just rode in
We went from drinkin' coffee to thinkin' of our sins

Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be

With the rose so red and the lilies so fair
And the mirltes so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portions of love had all blown away

Oh she taught me to love her and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
She left me no warning no words of farewell

Even tho' you lost they speak highly of your name, 'cause

[Chorus]

I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes 'cause you couldn't help at all, but

[Chorus]

I saw Gen'ral Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched in the battle of the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared, took days to count the dead, 'cause

[Chorus]

When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great vict'ry ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you, Johnny Reb, and all that you believe

You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
Yeah, you fought all the way, Johnny Reb

Johnny Cash,"They had a warrant out for me all over the country
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below

His steel gray eyes were blazing when he saw me
His hand was on his gun when he rode up
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up

Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
And he had me deep in Texas the next day
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away

A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die
But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a file
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles",Austin Prison

On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

Tried to deny but I love you like a do

You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you

As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call

As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say

You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that northern sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Mary Anne it's only five more miles to Mary Anne

That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's screams
And we'd best be movin' faster if we can
Dan just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Mary Anne it's only three more miles to Mary Anne

Come on Dan get up your ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you if I can
All right Dan perhaps it's best we'll just stop awhile and rest
For it's still another mile to Mary Anne it's still another mile to Mary Anne

Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn

These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On the bloody ground at the close of day

Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a narrow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
Where there's not a soul that will care for me
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie

I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley ann
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

Well John's had two daughters and the song
One went to Denver the other went wrong
His young wife died in a poolroom fight
But he tries to keep singing from morning till night

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

When I die take my saddle from the wall
Strap it my pony, lead him out of the stall
Throw my bones on his back, turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best

Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

Johnny Cash,"A cowpoke rode in, one hot dusty day
To a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say
Do I have a letter from home

The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his gray head
The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him
And these are the words that he said

No letter from home, no letter from home
There's never a letter from home
No message from mother or none of the others
There's never a letter from home

That night he was shot on the wrong side of town
No more of those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him
And said, ""Son here's your letter from home""

""If only I had just a little more time
To read it"", the young cowpoke said
""I can't take it with me and I must go on""
Then he died with his letter unread

No time for the letter from home
The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread
Too late for the letter from home",A Letter from Home
Johnny Cash,"The devil in hell, we're told was chained
A thousand years he there remained
He neither complain nor did he groan but
Was determined to start a hell of his own

Where he could torment the souls of men
Without being chained in a prison pen
So he asked the lord if he had on hand
Anything left when he made this land

The Lord said yes, there's a plenty on hand
But I left it down by the Rio Grande
The fact is ol' boy, the stuff is so poor
I don't think you could use it as the hell anymore

But the devil went down to look at the truck
And said if he took it as a gift he was stuck
For after lookin' that over carefully and well
He said this place is too dry for hell

But in order to get it off his hands
The Lord promised the devil to water the land
So trade was closed and deed was given
And the Lord went back to his home in heaven

And the devil said, now I got all what's needed
To make a good hell and he succeeded
He began by putting thorns all over the trees
He mixed up the sand with millions of fleas

He scattered tarantulas along the road
Put thorns on cactus and horns on toads
Lengthened the horns of the Texas steer
Put an addition to the rabbit's ear

Put a little devil in the bronco steed
And poisoned the feet of the centipede
The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion stings
The mosquito delights you with his buzzing wings

The sunbursts are there and so the ants
And if you sit down
You'll need to have soles on your pants
The wild boar rooms on a high chapparel

It's a hell of a place that he has for hell
The heat in the summers are hundred and ten
Too hot for the devil, too hot for men
The red pepper grows upon the banks of the brook

The Mexican use it in all that he cook
Just dine in with one of 'em and you're bound to shout
I've hell on the inside as well as it out
My hands are calloused July to July

I use a Big Dipper to navigate by
Fight off the wolves who drink from my well
So I have to be mean as hell
A sheep-herder came and put up the fence

I saw him one day but I ain't seen him since
But if you need a mutton we got mutton to sell
We're cowpunchers and we're mean as hell
Neither me nor my pony's got a pedigree

But he takes me where I'm wantin' to be
I'll ride him to death and when he has fell
I'll get me another one mean as hell
I shot me a calf and I cut off her head

'Cause the boys in the bunkhouse are waitin' to be fed
They rise in chime with the five thirty bell
And the best one of any of 'em is mean as hell",Mean as Hell

And I said mam what was it that happened mam and she said

Well everybody drifted off toward home finally

And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man

I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)

Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said

Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'

The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr Garfield and he said yeah he's gone

Who crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
Two yoke of oxen a big yeller dog
A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

One evenin' quite early they camped on the plat
Down by the road on a green shady flat
Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose
And Ike he just gazed on his Pike County rose

Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
Down in the sand she lay rollin' about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
He said, ""Betsy get up, you'll get sand in your eyes""

Well the Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that mornin' was fried
Ike he got discouraged and Betsy got mad
The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad

Well a miner said, ""Betsy will you dance with me""
""I will now old Hoss if you don't make too free
But don't dance me hard do you want to know why
Doggone you I'm chocked full of strong alkali""

I've got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that get bigger each day
The County will haul my belongings away I'm busted!

I went to my brother to ask for a loan I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking of calling on you I'm busted!",Busted [#][*]
Johnny Cash,"Oh, come all you young fellers, young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
'Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man, that I've seen in my day
(No laughing during the song please)
(It's been recorded I know, hell)
(Don't you know it's recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope,
And a dropper with his wine
A man will have less for the lure of the mine
And, I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Sorry about that little interruption there, but I just

Johnny Cash,"Last time, last time we were here at Folsom Prison,
They were hanging Joe Bean.
Is Joe still here, Joe Bean?
Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right?

Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for killing a man in Arkansas.
Funny thing about it, Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas.
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man.
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday.

See through the prison bars, Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand.
Just twenty short years from the day you were born, you died by the hangman's hand.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for a shooting that he never did.
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did.

Well, Joe, your mother is at the Capitol, asking the governor for a stay.
And it's hard on her, 'cause she knows where you were, on that particular day.
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe.

Well, the telegraph wires are humming.
Here, the governor's words come through.
He said, ""I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean,
I'll do, I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you.
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean.""

Alright. June! June Carter. Let's get June out here
Let's get June Carter and the Tennessee Three back out right now",Joe Bean [#][*]
Johnny Cash,"Anybody got any special requests for us to do
John Henry?
Lemme do John Henry then and we'll go...

Johnny Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
He said ""Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you,"" Said ""Listen boy
Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to.""

John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
He said, ""I'll pay you a quarter at a time starting tomorrow
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line.""

Then the section foreman said, ""Hey! Hammer-swinger!
I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?"" and he said,
""I can hoist a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.""
He said ""Can you swing a hammer"" He said ""do anything you hire me to.""

""Now ain't you something! So high and mighty with all that muscle!""
Go ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, and show me what you can do!""

He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
Pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do

With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
John Henry raised it back 'til it touched his heels then
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
Thirty-five cents a day for driving steel
Said ""Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!""
""I was born drivin' steel""

Well now John Henry hammered in the mountains
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
To watch make the cold-steel ring ""Lord! What a swinger!
Watch him make the cold-steel ring""

But the bad boss came up laughin' at John Henry
He said, ""You full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
We gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin'
Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you.""

John Henry said, ""I feed four little brothers
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of the livin'?
And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
Do engines get rewarded for their steam?

John Henry said to his captain said ""A man ain't nothin' but a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill ""How is you?
Said pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.
I said how are you Huh?
Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.

Two-thousand people hollered, ""Go John Henry!""
Then somebody hollered,"" The mountain's cavin' in!""
John Henry told the captin, ""Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.

""Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills""

Now, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
Early next mornin' he said,
""Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
Said you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up
And I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up
That I couldn't come up with it
He said, (dirty mind),
He said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
And when you swinging with that lead man
You tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,
I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats,
When they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.
They say,""Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger.""
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
Clickity clack

Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man

Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man

Yonder lies a steel-drivin'

Thank you very much
You know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia
Digin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.
And he was a mighty big man they say
That from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet
Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke",The Legend of John Henry's Hammer [#][*]
Johnny Cash,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds	
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues [Live] [Live]
Johnny Cash,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

[Chorus:]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

Johnny Cash,"After seven years behind these bars together
I'll miss you more than a brother when you go when you go
If only I had not tried to escape
They'd barred me with you I know yes I know

Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
And don't let them know I never will be free be free
Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
And send a picture of mother back to me

Say hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
But stay with me just another minute or so or so
After all this sweating blood together
Who'll be my fighting partner when you go when you go

The hardest time will be on Sunday morning
Church bells will ring on Heaven Hill Heaven Hill

The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry, ""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Her mother wiped the tears and said, ""See honey, you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay""
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine, ""Call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Johnny Cash,"Cisco Clifton had a fillin' station
About a mile and a half from town
Most cars passed unless they were out of gas
So Cisco was always around

Regular gas was all that it sold
Except tobacco matches and oil
Other than that he fixed lots of flats
Keepin' Cisco rough hands soiled

He'd wipe the gas and check the air
In a hundred times a day
He patiently gave directions
On how to get to the state highway

Usually he'd give 'em water
Or a tyre or two some air
And once a big black Cadillac
Spent seven dollars there

He'd give anybody anything they'd ask
And lend anything he had
His tools are tyres bumper jacks or wire
To the good ones or the bad

In wintertime there was a depot stove
And a table for a checker game
And every mornin' at sunup
The same checker players came

So Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
Was always in the red
Personal loans were personally gone
But never a word was said

One mornin' at eight, them checker players
Heard a big bulldozer roar like a freight
And Cisco said I hope my kids stay fed
When they build that Interstate

He'd managed to pay for property
Where his little fillin' station sat
And friends still came for checker game
So Cisco settled for that

He wouldn't say so but Cisco knew
That the Interstate was too much to fight
But to keep his will and to pay his bills
He did odd jobs at night

He still opened up at sunrise
And the checker game went on
The cars flew past on highest gas
And the neighbors had sold out and gone

If a car ever did go by he was lost
And if they stopped they were treated the same
So at Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
There's a howdy and a checker game",Cisco Clifton's Fillin' Station
Johnny Cash,"While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed

Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead

Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night

I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through

In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust

And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
You take ten good men and guts and luck
And you might navigate the whirl and the suck

At Chattanooga she oughta unwind
She could a run right on the Georgia Sea
But she cut right back through Tennessee

Well, the settlers come by raft
And boat bringin' everything that could stay a float
But like a loco horse that'll twist and buck
They hardly ever made it through the whirl and the suck

And the Chickamagua tribe and the Nickajack
They kept the watch where the river cut back
And if a raft or a boat ever rode the bend
The Indians got 'em cause they had 'em hemmed in

It took a mighty good man with salty hands
And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
You take ten good men and guts and luck
And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
",The Whirl and The Suck
Johnny Cash,"Like a sweet rippling mountain stream
Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek
Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on
So does the land just ripple on and on

As a heart gets soft on a woman
So can the heart get soft on the land
And to fall in love with a woman
As well as the land is to surely be in love

I stayed away too long I know
And every day was slow to go
Every night I dreamed I was here
It's been a mighty lonely year

Every mile I needed you
I kinda hope that you needed me too
Everywhere I saw your face around
Every town I was in

This old familiar place welcomed me again
Back to where I belonged
To be back to you and Tennessee
Back to you and Tennessee

Beside the Cumberland River
Where the grass is soft and sweet
We ran across the fields of cedar
Hiding from the noisy streets

And when the leaves fell from the cold
The stars were silver the moon was gold
I said it's yours with love from me
I'm planting my roots in this ground

And when they look for me I'll be found
With something that is part of me
You and Tennessee
Back with you and Tennessee
",You and Tennessee
Johnny Cash,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughing during this song please it's being recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon

I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop lovin' me a little at a time

Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time

For the Smiling Bill McCall Show

He won't be plantin' potato slips
When he cashes in his chips

Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so

It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town

Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committin' suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried

Johnny Cash,"Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
And His hands could join a table true enough to stand forever
And He might have spun His life out in the coolness of the morning
But He put aside His tools and He walked the burning highways
And He built His house from people just like these

And He found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And He found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind Him emptied
He put aside His tools and stopped to touch the dying
And He built His house from people just like these

It was on a storming Sunday when He rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before Him
Were like the crimes they laid against Him
It was on a storming Friday when He climbed the streets to Calvary
And where He died today why they're selling beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago

But would He stand today upon the sands of California
And walk the sweating blacktop of New York and Mississippi?
Would He be a guest on Sunday, a vagrant on a Monday?
With the doors locked tight against His kind you know

Oh, come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent, cathedrals to our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't You come and build a house on rock again

Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
And His hands could form a table true enough to stand forever

Johnny Cash,"And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil.

It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row.
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold.
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul.
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar.

My thirsty wanted whisky; my hungry needed beans,
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream.
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams,
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar.

Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern:
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor;
Friendly shadows.

I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar.
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar.
An' he turned and said: ""Come up here boy, and show us what you are.""
I said: ""I'm dry."" He bought me a beer.

He nodded at my guitar and said: ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him. He said: ""You ain't makin' any money, are you?""
I said: ""You've been readin' my mail.""
He just smiled and said: ""Let me see that guitar.
""I've got something you oughta hear.""
Then he laid it on me:

""If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,
""To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.
""And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,
""Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?""

There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind,
Who were crucified for what they tried to show.
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time.
'Cause the truth remains that no-one wants to know.

Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before,
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door.
When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor,
And lonesome was more than a state of mind.

You see, the devil haunts a hungry man,
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him.
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing.
Then I stole his song.

And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen,
To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear.
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about,
Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care.

I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same,
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul.
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed.
'Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to know.",To Beat the Devil
Johnny Cash,"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota.
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis, later on down the river.
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
Raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.

If you don't mind Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs
I'd love to

Appreciate a little help on guitar, alright. Thank you Carl

Well,my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do
Now you're gonna die""

(yeah, that's what I told him)

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""

Well what could I do? What could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my Pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..
Bill or George! Any-damn-thing but Sue!

Johnny Cash,"And, and Carl Perkins wrote us another song
That tells about the reason for it all
That takes us back home and
Again, tells it like it was when I was a little bitty kid
And we gathered around the piana
And me and little brother would join in
And mamma would sing tenor, and dad would sing bass

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

You could hear us singin' for a country mile

But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

We'd like to hit one serious note for you
Even if that note is out of tune

June and I went to the land of Israel in the month of May last year
With a tape recorder
We took it with us
And there are some things in this world
That everyone wants to see or hear at one time or anther in their life
And especially for you fellas, I think it's
We feel real good that we can bring back sounds of the people and the places
I know a lot of you are just like I was
They were always dear to you, the stories and the songs about Israel
We went to Nazareth, Thank you
We went to Nazareth, and went to the Sea of Galilee to Tiberius
We went to Jerusalem, the way of the cross, went to the wailing wall
All these sounds are on the album for you to hear,
And we hope that you'll enjoy some of it
I'd like to tell you, a real happening in this album
We went into the little town of town of Kayna
Just over the hills from Nazareth
And there's a church that sits over the sis-turn where the water came from
That Christ turned to wine where the first miracle was performed
We went into the church, saw the sis-turns,
You could hear the sounds of the water in there
Hear the Echo
I was so impressed when I came out of the church, if I ever had an inspiration
And I had one then
From seeing what I had just seen and heard
And I said under my breath ""He turned the water, into wine of all things""
On the way to Tiberius, in the car
In the next few minutes, I wrote this song

He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Canan town the word went all around that
He turned the water into wine

Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and
Walked upon the Sea of Galilee

He turned the water into wine he did my lord now,
He turned the water into wine
In the little Canan town, the word went all around that
He turned the water into wine

He fed the hungry multitude (didn't he brother)
He fed the hungry multitude.
With a little bit of fish and bread,
They said every one was fed, (5000)
He fed the hungry multitude.

He turned the water into wine.

He turned the water into wine.

Johnny Cash,"I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay 
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the barren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon

I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon

South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodigal returning to the girl in Saskatoon

Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lilies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon

My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wanderlust was stifled
By possession of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon",Girl in Saskatoon

The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the Captain had his orders, so the roll call begin

McCoy, Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd, Thomas Wilson

I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air

Johnny Cash,"(Joy to the world the Lord is come) 
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman 
He grew up in another small village 
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter 

Then for three years he was a traveling minister 
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born 
And where he did go he usually walked 
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home 

Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city 
Yes here was a man 
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness 
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world 

Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world 
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him 
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him 
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies 

Then he went through the mockery of a trial 
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves 
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled 
For the only piece of property that he had in this world 

And that was his robe his purple robe 
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross 
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends 
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone 

And today he's a centerpiece of the human race 
Our leader in the column to human destiny 
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched 
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas 

All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned

He tried to help everybody 'long

Johnny Cash,"From a carnie show and a rodeo that shared a three day stand
A cowboy met a fiery carnie queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carnie van
They laughed and loved and shared shortlived dreams

But the carnie show and the rodeo went their seperate ways
And the carnie season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark eyed carnie queen

The black sheep child that grew up wild
From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire
An orphan of the road

I was still a child when my mama died
Of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name too wild to tame no one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone

In dingy bars and cold boxcars hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down

The black sheep child that grew up wild
From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire
An orphan of the road

In the misty rain I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep grey night I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor

And he said I tried to find her but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him but I never did but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die

I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flickerin' flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother sir I said of her I have her same dark eyes

""We've been everywhere once and some places twice""
As I had another helpin' of country ham
She said, ""We ain't never been to Vietnam
There's a bunch of our boys over there""
So, we went to the Orient, Saigon

Well, we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Ben
We checked in and everything got kinda quite
But a soldier boy said, ""Just wait 'til tonight
Things get noisy, things start happening'
Big bad firecrackers""

Well, that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
Then we crawled into bed for some peace and quite
But things weren't peaceful and things weren't quite
Things were scary

Well, for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say, ""What was that?""
I said ""That was a shell or a bomb""
She said, ""I'm scared"", I said, ""Me too""

Well, all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs and the motor shells
Shook our bed every time one fell and it never let up
It was gonna get worse before it got any better

Well when the sun came up the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep and we were sleepin' sound
Then a soldier knocked on our door and said
""Last night we brought in seven dead and fourteen wounded""
And would we come down to the base hospital
And see the boys, yeah

So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs 'til dawn again
And the helicopters brought in a wounded man
Night after night, day after day, comin' and a goin'

So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said so long
We did our best to let them know that we cared
For every last one of them it's over there
Whether we belonged over there or not
Somebody over here loves them and needs them

Well, now that's about all there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there anymore
Hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war's over with and they all come back home
To stay in peace

Well Johnny he packed up to leave her but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
He said ""I'm your man I wouldn't do you wrong""

Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinkin' about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man he wasn't doin' her wrong

Then in the front door walked a redhead Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man but she was far away

He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none

Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him
She slapped him a time or two
She said ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you""

But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)
Me and little brother would join right in there

I grew up picking cotton in the Mississippi sand

Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta take a stand

Singing songs of sadness picking girls off of the street
He made a little bit of music was a leader of a band
And they call him the muddy Mississippi band

I took her out to churches to socials schools and things
She was a rose just right for picking and he nipped her in the bud

Johnny Cash,"It rained all the way to Cincinnati
With our mattress on top of the car
Us kids were eatin' crackers and baloney
And papa kept on driving never stopped once at a bar
Then mama started talking about Jesus
And how our lives could be from now on
While papa bought a used tire in Columbus
Mama rocked the baby till all her tears were gone

She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves

I remember when papa finally gave up drinking
I think mama was the only one on earth that really thought he could
I remember all the times we'd packed everything we owned
Into some old car and started out for some new town
And through it all mama's faith was the one thing
That was strong enough to finally do the some good

Johnny Cash,"Six foot six he stood on the ground,
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds,
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.
He was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck,
Look you in the eye and never back up,
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love.
You can't see it with your eyes,
Hold it in your hand.
But like the wind, it covers our land,
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,
This thing called love.
It can lift you up,
Never let you down,
Take your world and turn it all around,
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,
That's stronger than love.
Most men are like me, they struggle in doubt,
They trouble their minds day in and day out,
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love.
But when I see a mother's tenderness,
As she holds her young close to her breast,
Then I thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.
You can't see it with your eyes,
Hold it in your hand.
But like the wind, it covers our land,
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,
This thing called love.
It can lift you up,
Never let you down,
Take your world and turn it all around,

Mama called us together and mama tried to smile 
She said you know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year 
There's just no spending money and well at least we're all here 
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents 
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat 
That's quite a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant 
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were 
At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her 
Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me 
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread 
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed 
Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean 
But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things 
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then 
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him 
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks 
And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town 
A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us 
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk 
And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil 
A log apples cranges and such 
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found 
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down 
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door 
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said 
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door 
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back 
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light 
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night 
Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent 
Then daddy put on his gumboots waited for the thaw back home in Dyess Arkansas",Christmas as I Knew It

They grow a lot of sugarcane and tomatoes and things at Rose Hall now
It used to be just a sugarcane plantation back in the days of slavery
And they tell stories about the place and about the great house at Rose Hall
That many many years ago they came from the country of Haiti
A lady named Annie Palmer who lived in that great house there
And she was a mistress of the plantation she was the boss her word was law
Well they tell a lot of tales about Annie
They say she had three husbands one at a time I guess
But they also tell tales about Annie and the slaves
There were about 5000 slaves on the plantation
And she had her favorites and she had the ones that weren't her favorites
Well down on the sea there're three tall palm trees wavin' in the breeze
And they say that maybe Annie Palmer's three husbands
Are buried under those palm trees

On the Island of Jamaica quite a long long time ago
At Rose Hall Plantation where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer the mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear to see a frown on Annie's face

Are they sleeping neath the palms beside the Caribbean Sea
At night I hear you ridin' and I hear your lovers call
And still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall hmm

Johnny Cash,"I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
People gettin' ready for battle and there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake and the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today

Matthew 24 is knocking at the door
And there can't be too much more to come to past (come to past)
Matthew 24 is knockin' at the door and today or one day more could be the last

The great bear from the Northland has risen from his sleep
And the army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep
The young and old now prophesy a coming prince of peace
And last night I dreamed of lightening in the East

Johnny Cash,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothing' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothing' left to lose

Johnny Cash,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning 
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad 
So I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost 
Somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk 
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk 
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday

Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows

If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

Said: ""Steve, you're way behind time

""Shovel on a little more coal

This is how it read

Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans.

And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina.

Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two.

God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.

She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

About life out on the road
If he does a lotta singing

If he gets a lotta loving

And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his

Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road

I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive

Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup

And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night

I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate

All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive

See the fish all dead upon the shore
Don't go near the water

I said, ""I think I got a nibble son""
""Me too"", he said
Then he said, ""Daddy if we catch a fish can we eat him""
I said, ""Well there was a time son
This water's bad now and I might not be safe to eat the fish
But there was a time""

There was a time the air was clean
And you could see forever 'cross the plains
The wind was sweet as honey
And no one had ever heard of acid rain

We're torturin' the earth
And pourin' every kind of evil in the sea
We violated nature
And our children have to pay the penalty

Don't go near the water children
See the fish all dead upon the shore
Don't go near the water
'Cause the water isn't water anymore

Don't go near the water children
See the fish all dead upon the shore
Don't go near the water
'Cause the water isn't water anymore

Ahh: I told my Mama: ""Baby, don't you cry. ""I'll get a job before the day go by."" I don't know where, and that is why, I'm a worried man. (Worried.) Worried man, a worried man. (Worried.)

You can't make it at the cotton mill

If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Get put on at the Harlan mine
Be the last one out at quittin' time

You already workin' when the whistle blew
Never complain about a job to do
When they say who can, you say I will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill

If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill

You need a good woman to share your bed
To keep you loved and to keep you fed
To help you to face another day
To get you up and on your way

Where the golden rule don't rule out true
You do to them before they do to you
Watch out for yourself or nobody will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill

If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill

Saturday night you go to Harlan town
You shoot some pool and you fool around
You watch the girls and you drink bootleg
Get starved to death before you beg

You trust in luck till your luck is gone
Then jump right in and you hang right on
There may be times you would have to kill
If you ever gonna be king of the hill

If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill

When the last of the coals out of every vein
Had long been gone on the northbound train
Walk up to the top and if you're standing still
You can call yourself king of the hill

But if you fall like a lot have done
By accident or knife or gun
When they lay you high on the mountain still
You can call yourself king of the hill

If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill

Johnny Cash,"I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench an old man was sitting there
I said, your old courthouse is kinda run down
He said, naw, it'll do for our little town
I said, your old flagpole has leaned a little bit
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it

He said, have a seat, and I sat down
Is this the first time you've been to our little town?
I said, I think it is
He said, I don't like to brag
But we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag

You see, we got a little hole in that flag there when 
Washington took it across the Delaware
And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writing say can you see
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seams

And it almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the texas flag, but she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag

On Flanders field in World War one
She got a big hole from a Bertha gun
She turned blood red in World War Two
She hung limp and low a time or two
She was in Korea and Vietnam
She went where she was sent by Uncle Sam

She waved from our ships upon the Briny foam
And now they've about quit waving her back here at home
In her own good land here she's been abused 
She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused

And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout the land
And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
'Cause she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more

So we raise her up every morning
We take her down every night
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
On second thought, I do like to brag
'Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag",Ragged Old Flag
Johnny Cash,"I've been a thrill seeking rambler
And often came into this town
But the thrills were too high for my little sky
So I dug in and I've settled down

And I got a good job in Nashville
No way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves
Making brut and snuff

Southern comfort is killin' me

I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room

Southern comfort is killin' me

I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carryin' on
She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on

But I guess she got tired of tobacco
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
And memories are burnin' in my mind

And Southern comfort is killin' me

The Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee
I'm sniffin' and dippin' and livin' alone
I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
She's in some other county now proving her own

Will you live the lowly heart about to break
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake

Would you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the persecuted
Will you show the bounds how all the chains can break
Did you sow the cropper seed will you walk among the weak
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake

Did you turn the other cheek are you counted with the meek
Would you give a little more than you can take
Will you shine your little light on the children of the night

And berries from my old vine

While I got it on my mind

Then she looks at me and I can see

And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat

And leavin' the girls to cry

Johnny Cash,"Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
He's been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway and an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind
He was all around cowboy 1959 from the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time

They rode him high and hard to the ground
But he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner
And the feeling of bein' a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again

The windmills're turning on the west Texas plains but he's dry as an old river bed
He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain but he knows he'll be ridin' again
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo to be the all around cowboy again
But he remembers the thrill",All Around Cowboy

As your face is shining upon me 
A love that would never cease 
Out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep 
And up in the starry skies 
And further out to sea 
Late in time when it will come 
I see it in my dreams 
At night with the cold wind blowing

Gone the dream, it's all faded now

Lying wide awake 
All across the land the lights are out 
Under an open sky 
I feel for you and everybody 
Dreaming in your beds 
I'm feeling lost, there is nothing 
Nothing more than this 
Going out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep 
And up in the starry skies 
And further out to sea 
Late in time when it will come

I don't ever lay awake, I never think my heart will break

I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

I don't lose no sleep at night 'cause things with you are going right

And all of my songs remain unsung

Johnny Cash,"This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfillin' his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County

Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true

So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God

Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil

And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got

Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased

And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel

I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Ain't nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's gettin' weaker and she's gettin' older every day

And she talks softly about joinin' papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Tryin' to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean

But I just wish that papa was here right now
To see this good crop that we finally got
Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long

Johnny Cash,"Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writin' on
And after wipin' her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said

For mowing the yard 5 dollars
For making my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For getting a good report card 5 dollars
And for raking the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents

Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turning the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him

For the nine months she carried you growing inside her, no charge
For the nights we sat up with you, doctoring you, praying for you, no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead, no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college, no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

Well when I finished readin' he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge",No Charge

I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?"" and he said,
""I can turn a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.""
""Can you swing a hammer, boy?"" ""Yes sir, I'll do anything you hire me to.""

Spoken:
""Now ain't you somethin'! So high and mighty with all that muscle! Just go
Ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer!""

He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do

With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
John Henry raised it back til' it touched his heels then
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
Thirty-five cents a day for drivin' steel
""Sweat! Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!""
""I was born drivin' steel""

Well John Henry hammered in the mountain
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
To watch make the coal-steel ring ""Lord! What a swinger!
Watch him make the coal-steel ring""

But the bad boys came up laughin' at John Henry
They said,"" Your full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
We gonna get a steamdrill to do your share of drivin'
Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you.""

John Henry said,""I feed for little brothers
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of livin'?
And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
Do engines get rewarded for their steam?

John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner nap
Had thirty minutes to rest before the bell
The mine boys hollered,"" Get up whoever you are and get a pickax
Mine me enough to start another hell and keep it burnin'
Mine me enough to start another hell.

John Henry said to his captain said ""A man ain't nothin' but a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
'Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill ""How is you?
(spoken) Pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me. Huh?
Well, can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.

(Faster...........)
Two-thousand people hollered, ""Go John Henry!!!!!""
Then somebody hollered,"" The mountain's cavin' in!!!!!!""
John Henry told the captin,""Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.

""Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and there ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills""

(Slower...........)
(Spoken)
Well, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
He laid down to rest his weary back and early next mornin' he said,
""Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
You know I believe this is the first time there ever was the sun come
And I couldn't come up. Take my hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
Swing that hammer like you seen me do it
They'll all know your John Henry's woman but tell em' that ain't all you can
Do
Tell em'.........

I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats, the men do
When they come to the place where he's laying' retsina' his back.
They say,""Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger.""
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.

Johnny Cash,"Many, many years ago
When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees

And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with

So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down

And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man

Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the loggin' camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please

I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees

Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud

When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's gonna fall for the Timber man

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

And when they're cuttin' on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall
The man yells out timber, timber

On the river of your plans I'm up the creek
Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted
On the calendar of your events I'm last week

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart",Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart
Johnny Cash,"The old home town looks the same,
As I step down from the train,
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa.
Down the road I look, and there comes Mary,
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

The old house is still standing,
Though the paint is cracked and dry,
And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on.
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Yes, they'll all come to see me,
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Then I awake and look around me,
To the cold gray walls that surround me,
And then I realize that I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,
Arm in arm, I'll walk at daybreak.
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home.

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old oak tree,
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.","Green, Green Grass of Home"
Johnny Cash,"Thank you very much
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom prison
And last night was the first time I've ever sung this song
Anyways, this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley
Um, hope we do your song justice Glen, we're going to do our best

Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the souls of many lost men
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the House of God is never locked

Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel
And I thank the Lord for helpin' me each day
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on ever stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's givin' me the strength to carry on
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

Have an announcement from Lt. Piper
Ah, steady
Uh, Duffy, number nine oh four seven, custody office
There's a gentleman here I'd like to have stand up, who's a very very proud man
He used to be many years ago, a bad land farmer down in Dias, Arkansas

Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Did I hear someone applaud?

Now the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the north wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

And don't let them know I never will be free be free

How about one big cheer for Luther Perkins

Yeah, I had a song called San Quentin, I was going to do
Where's my....hey, in my kit back in there where I've got all my dope
I mean, where I got all my things

There's a, there's a, there's a little red notebook back there
Would somebody, would one of the guards bring it to me
Somebody bring it to me, bring me the red notebook, and I will uh..

Hey, that, that briefcase back there of mine, you know,
That's got all the songs I stole in it

Telling it like it is, ain't I? Alright

Wrote a song yesterday. I try.
It takes a lot of imagination to write a sometimes to write a song
And to really, to really put something into it
Where somebody else can understand it and feel it .
Well we've been in several prisons
San Quentin, and Folsom prison, and the Starkville Mississippi jail
An El Paso jail. And uh.
You wouldn't believe it, one night I got in jail in Starkville Mississippi
For picking flowers.
I was walking down the street. I may sing heaven for you a little bit later
I was walking down the street....what?
Excuse me I couldn't hear you I was talking
I was walking down the street, and uh
You know, going to get me some cigarettes or something
'Bout two in the morning, after a show. I think it was
Anyway, I reached down and picked a dandelion here and a daisy there as I went along
And this car pulls up.
Said, get it the hell in here boy, what are you doing?
Said, I'm just picking flowers
Well,thirty six dollars for picking flowers and a night in jail (goddamn)
You can't hardly win can ya, goddamn
No telling what they'd do if you pull an apple or something
Well I'd like to do this song on behalf of all you guys in San Quentin
To kinda get back at whoever you want to out there
In my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville Mississippi
That still has my thirty six dollars

Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel,
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well.
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees;

I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze.
I found myself surrounded; one policeman said: ""That's him.
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m.""

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
I said: ""What the hell did I do?""
And he said: ""Shut up and sit down.""

Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Ah, shut up.""
Well, I sure was in a fix.

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so;
I ain't bein' treated right.""

Well, they're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.

Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
At 8 a.m. they let me out, I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!""
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.",Starkville City Jail
Johnny Cash,"There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
You could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first

Well the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall

Well a years went by since .....that's the truth
Well a years gone (them mean bastards ain't they?)
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall

May your walls fall down and may I live to tell.
May all the world forget you ever stood.

In New York city just walking the street
Ran out of money had nothing to eat
I stopped at the Plaza, that fancy hotel
Where you can check in if you're well to do wellâ?¦
The first of July and a hundred and four
I stopped at the Plaza's front revolving door
I stepped in the door and went around for a ride
Treatin' myself to the cool air inside
Then I found myself in a chandeliered room
Where people were dining and I hid in the gloom
My hunger pains hurt 'til I thought I would break
When a waiter brought out a big strawberry cake

Oh that strawberry cake
Oh that strawberry cake
Out in California them berries were grown
And into this city them berries were flown
For making that strawberry cake

Then I thought of Oxnard, just north of LA
Where I picked strawberries for many a day
Hard work with no future for the harvest was done
And I headed eastward a-travelin' by thumb
And nobody wanted me here in this town
I felt like a stray dog they all kick around
Them berries reminded me of my bad breaks
I'm hungry and I want that strawberry cake

I deserve that strawberry cake
Deserve that strawberry cake
I ran and I grabbed it then out the side door
Into Central Park through the bushes I tore
Holdin' my strawberry cake

I look back behind me and what do I see
The chef and headwaiter and the maÃ®tre d
I had a nice helpin' of cake as I ran
I gobble them berries as fast as I can
They're closin' the gap as I slowed down to eat
But the cake brought a new surge of power to my feet
I hid in the bush when the lead I did take
And I quietly finished my strawberry cake

I ate all that strawberry cake
That fine fancy strawberry cake
Someone at the plaza is without dessert
But for the first time in days now my belly don't hurt
I'm full of strawberry cake



",Strawberry Cake
Johnny Cash,"In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation

I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growin'
And the seasons changed and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowin'

Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breathtakin' lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people

And I rambled north and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted

In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothin' green ever growin'
Where the buildings hide the risin' sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowin'

Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after

In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said, ""Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people?""

And she said, ""I will"", and she said, ""I do""
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
'Cause she loved the noisy city

But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growin'
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to goin'

Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said, ""I'll take the city""

Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm goin' home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older

Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team

What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around

It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away

Bravely fighting the battle of time. 
There's a dear one who's wept through life's sorrows. 
It's that silver haired daddy of mine.

If I could recall all the heartaches, dear ole daddy I've caused you to bear. 
If I could erase those lines from your face and bring back the gold to your hair. 
If God would but grant me the power just to turn back the pages of time.

Johnny Cash,"I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight

And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
He won't say how many tried and died
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run

He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again

Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky

Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid

Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time

Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace

You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far

Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun

If you cannot stand, I've got a place for you to fall

And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go

I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
'Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go

County road 6-40, State Highway 45
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go

Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain

There's hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good

The gospel ain't gospel until it is spread

Johnny Cash,"There once was a musical troupe
A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land

They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy on his rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted",The One on the Right Is on the Left
Johnny Cash,"About 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with The Gambler; We were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
Til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak. 

He said: ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
""And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
""And if you don't mind my sayin', I would say you're out of aces;
""And for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice."" 

So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
He said: ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right."" 

""'Cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
""Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
""And ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
""And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. 

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done."" 

And when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
Put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.


""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.

Johnny Cash,"Every town has its town bum
I guess ours had one
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
Well his name was Abner Brown

I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
And nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin

He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town
So they tolerated Abner Brown

And all us kids were on his side
'Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall
'Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all

And after school and on weekends
You could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was
A good old drunk named Abner Brown

Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low
And higher places that I've been

Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown

Lord take me back to the cotton land
To Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin

He's probably dead many years ago
And gone the way that old drunks go

I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
Now the years they rolled by and old Shep he grew old
His eye sight at last it grew dim
Then one day the doctor looked at him and said I can't do no more for him Jim
With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
And I aimed it at Shep's faithful head

Johnny Cash,"Those cotton fields were hot
And that tractor never was my kind of livin'
And when I hit sixteen
I had my size and I hit the road to freedom

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her sayin' to me
""Get your guitar and pick the Wildwood Flower'""

Now Memphis was big
And it was hard to find a job and so I didn't
And it was easier to go back to the country
And it was more like livin'

Now, I've been down every road
And I've stood on every porch where they were givin'
And if they had a dime on an hour
I would pick the Wildwood Flower

It's hard to turn around
And look back down the roads that I have traveled
'Cause like a never endin' ball of twine
My dreams have come unraveled

Now as evening lays its shawl
Across the shoulders of my life, I find
I couldn't tie my life together
With guitar strings and a poet's heartfelt mind

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying to me
Get your guitar and pick the Wildwood Flower

Play it like this, son",Pick the Wildwood Flower
Johnny Cash,"Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing

Goodbye good luck may God bless you I don't say I won't love again 
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything",Time Changes Everything
Johnny Cash,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues
Johnny Cash,"I'm gonna sit on the porch and pick on my old guitar
I'm gonna lay on my back and laugh at my lucky star
And then I'm gonna fly away and never come back someday
'Less I thought I was gonna land right close to where you are

Well, if I thought anybody cared I'd send back word
Strapped to the leg of a trans celestial bird
I wonder if I really ever did leave how many would there be to grieve?
How would they react to the word?

Well, I wouldn't ever want to hurt a solitary soul
I have still got all 6 foot 2 in control
But when my obligation's low is a greasy uphill road
And pleasin' everybody but me is my first goal

I want to sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
And just hope you're hangin' loose where ever you are
And for the joy you brought to me this song I sung for thee
While I sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
",I'm Gonna Sit on the Porch and Pick on My Old Guitar
Johnny Cash,"I built her a castle of perma stone
But I should have reigned more with her
Too often I left my queen alone
And that was no way to leave her

I rode out in quest of song and wine
And that was no way to treat her
I kept her hangin' like grapes on the vine
And that was no way to keep her

Reds Goodguy rode by on his milk white steed
And casually mentioned my misdeeds
He promised her love far greater than mine
Thus pulled out and plucked my grapes from the vine

I built her a castle with patios
But I seldom cooked out upon it
I bought her a TV with stereo
But I never listened much to it

Now I have a castle but the queen's not home
And that is no way to have her
I have the vine but the grapes are gone
And that's no way to run a vineyard

Running o'er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Sou'ville headquarters on the line
Receiving there strict orders from a station just behind

Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time

Up the road he darted against the rocks he crashed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast was smashed
His head lay against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad to be born for an engineer on the C&O road to die

The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy lie still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die with the engine I love one hundred and forty three

The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved

Johnny Cash,"The assembly line is runnin' slow on Monday
They've been livin' it up
And layin' up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to kinda come around
But they still feel bad and they're down

And mad ‘cause they've got four more day
Before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feelin' fine again
And they're workin' like a dog and diggin' in

Tryin' to do everything they should
Puttin' 'em cars together good
And I got me a car that was made
On Wednesday, on Wednesday

If you're gonna buy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough
To get one made on Wednesday

On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week
That's the day they make lemons dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday
Friend, you'll soon be in the creek

’Cause it's payday and the loafin' has begun
Lord them Friday cars just hope you don't get one

Johnny Cash,"This world that I live in is empty and cold
This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul
I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son
I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run

So here I return to a back street of thrills
Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill
And then I treat shame like an old friend from home
That I can lean on till the misery is gone

A new day is here yet nothing is new
You're still gone and I tremble for you

I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight
But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light
Of course you're not there, no, you never are
Then I try to forget that there's always a bar

And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do
But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you

",I Tremble for You
Johnny Cash,"Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams

",My Old Faded Rose
Johnny Cash,"I stood in there in the shadows
As they went strolling by
Now she ain't my girl no longer
There's no reason I should cry

But I knew there went my future
And I couldn't stop the tears
And the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I spent every dime I had on her
And when it was gone
She said, ""Hun, it's sure been fun
But it's time you moved along""

So I stood there in the shadows
And I had my .44
I could hear her mocking laughter
But she won't laugh anymore

Now I'm down here in the gaol house
And I know what brought me here
It was the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

Well, I guess, I should have left this town
And her far behind
For the way that she made fun of me
Keeps running through my mind

Well, the jury showed no mercy
And I never asked for none
'Cause I know I've got it coming
I'm not proud of what I've done

But down here in this darkness
More and more I seem to hear
The sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I hear the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ear

And some old shack, and me and you

And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again

Remember how we used to walk and talk
Walk and talk, holdin' hands
We said we loved each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans

I guess I'd better straighten out my mind
Straighten it out, and go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times

Before a wild bird sings I'm gonna fly

Rolls along past houses, farms & fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Good mornin' America, how are you?
Don't you know me? I'm your native son!

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters & the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Johnny Cash,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black",Man in Black
Johnny Cash,"Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a fifty three
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER

And picked it up, it's cheaper that way

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

""And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

""And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am

Johnny Cash,"He drinks a cup of coffee and way before the sun he's up and goin'
Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowin'
All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
And then he'll come back in the evening
And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true

This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday

Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by

Please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told
(I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor ol' darling alone)
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
Now I have a grand ship out on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
That ship would be anchored and sold

Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling
And there I'd be willing to die",The Prisoner's Song

Johnny Cash,"When Robert E Lee surrendered the Confederacy Jefferson Davis was upset about it 
He said how dare that man resent an order 
Form the president of the Confederate States of America 
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself 
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up 
Would cost about twenty thousand lives on both sides 
And he said two hundred and forty thousand dead already is enough 
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother war 
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won 
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say Dod bless Robert E Lee 
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down 
Cotton fields are blue with Sherman's troupes 
I overheard a Yankee say yesterday Nashville fell 
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help 
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see 
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee 
Sherman's troupes burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky 
And those of us who survived it are watchin' my Dixie die 
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down 
And surrender to the Yankees and Ulysees S Grant 
So look away look away Dixie... 
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground

He threw his mother's wedding ring
And he said you won my money
But it ain't gonna do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game
against your fancy stick
The Baron's eyes got foggy
as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over
Like he had been hit below the belt
Twenty years ago 
It was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left
that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder
when the Baron shot the break
But it grew thickly quiet
as He lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder
and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman
Who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished
The eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up
and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring 
In the hands that held him long ago
and he tossed that fancy shooting stick

And you're the one I need

I carved a whistle from a reed

And you're the one I need

There's so much I don't see
I don't see how hair can turn silver-grey
I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind
With a sharp axe to grind

And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist
I don't understand why there is loneliness
I don't know why they claim some men have no soul
But there's one thing I do know

[Chorus]

No, He never keeps His window closed",God Ain't No Stained Glass Window

Johnny Cash,"I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers 
Oh, what a dream 
The houses all were silver towers 
Oh, what a dream 
Beside the road an angel sat, 
I said hello and tipped my hat 
And stopped when I saw her smile 
And set me down a while 
I set me down a while 
You dreamer you

I tried the angel for a kiss 
Oh, what a dream 
But she turned away and my lips missed 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, ""Sir, I'll have you know 
I met you just a while ago 
You're welcome for to sit 
But calm yourself a bit, sir 
Calm yourself a bit 
You dreamer you

I fell in love like one, two, three 
Oh, what a dream 
I asked the angel to marry me 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, ""Sir, I can't marry you, 
But I'm a dream that can come true 
There are dreams of much my worth 
That live upon the earth, sir 
Live upon the earth 
You dreamer you""

Then I awoke and found my love 
Oh, what a dream 
As heavenly as the one above 
Oh, what a dream 
We'll marry in a sea of flowers, 
Home will be a silver tower 
There'll be heaven in my life 
With an angel for a wife 
With an angel for a wife 
You dreamer you 
You dreamer you","Oh, What a Dream"
Johnny Cash,"San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me.
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you.
You've cut me and have scarred me through and thru.
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man;
Miter Congressman why can't you understand.

San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you may my soul;
And you stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell.
May your walls fall down and may I live to tell.
May all the world forget you ever stood.
Ans may all the world regret you did no good.

Johnny Cash,"The seasons come the seasons go we get a little sunshine rain and snow 
Just the way that it was planned to be 
But there's no seasons in my heart while you play the leading part 
Cause the flowers will bloom eternally 
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow and my tears like withered leaves will fall 
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow and darling we could be happy after all 

As it is in nature's plan no season get the upper hand 
How I try to keep this fact in mind 
The trees are bare the cold wind blows and by experience we should know 
Winter comes but the spring is close behind

Johnny Cash,"My name is Joe Roberts I work for the State 
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks No 8 
I've always done an honest job honest as I could 
Got a brother named Frankie Frankie ain't no good 
Ever since we were young kids it's been the same come down 
I'd get a call on a short way Frankie's in trouble downtown 
But if it was any other man I'd put him straight away 
But sometimes when it's your brother you look the other way

Man turns his back on his family he ain't no good 
Well Frankie went into the army back in 1965 
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife 
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we's gettin' robbed 
Frankie came home in '68 and me I took this job

While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line 
Man turns his back on his family ain't no friend of mine 
The night was like any other I got a call bout the quarter of nine 
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line 
There was a kid on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head 
There was a girl cryin' at a table it was Frankie she said 
I ran out and I jumped in my car then I hit the lights 
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night 
It was down by the crossroads out bout willow bank 
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank 
Well I chased him through them county roads 
Till the sign said Canadian border five miles from here 
Pulled over to the south out the highway watched his taillights disappeared

Johnny Cash,"Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Back in the saddle again

My little boy said, ""Daddy, who's Gene Autry?""
His old movie was comin' on TV
And I said, ""Let me tell you about him, son""
And I took him upon my knee

""Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright""

""I'd be right downtown at the picture show
Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good""

Singin', ""Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again""

""Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was ridin' right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine""

""And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot""

""Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me""

Singin', ""Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again""

""And you know the way
He rescued the rancher's daughter
He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home
With a good victorious smile""

""Now you ask me, 'Who's Gene Autry?'
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him
Like I did forty years ago""

Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way

Johnny Cash,"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart

Johnny Cash,"Some days I think this old machine is out to get me
Some days she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week
I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who

I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me

I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules
So say a little prayer every day
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain
You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop

When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99

A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away

Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand

Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time

Johnny Cash,"There was a man whose deeds were dark as night
And quite by chance he rode into the light
A man, wild as a dust devil with, no place to run
Livin' by his wits and by his gun

He met a girl like none he'd ever known
She cared not for the wild oats he had sewn
And, so, he laid his gun down and set his spirit free
Began livin' in respectability

But his old ways of thinkin' wouldn't die
Could not forget the old creed he lived by
And the good and bad and the right and wrong kept fightin' for his soul
Till his heart and mind both went out of control

But now the old saloon had lost its spell
What once was laughter now was livin' hell
And the hookers, guns and drinkin' in his life were out of place
And in his mind he saw an Angel's face

So, he burned all his bridges in a day
And the Devil deeds were done and laid away
And he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
And the Angel got the Badman in the end
",Angel and the Badman
Johnny Cash,"I'm an easy rider, the wind is at my back
I'm an easy rider, the white line is my track

I'm an easy rider, my wheels love to roll
I'm an easy rider, I ride a new road every day
I'm an easy rider, I will see you on my way

I got a number down in every town in my little black book
And they understand that I'm a travelin' man
So they don't think they got hooked
I'm an easy rider, I love that gray highway

I'm an easy rider, oh Lord, I love to roll

Johnny Cash,"I went out walking
Through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking
Under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

I went drifting
Through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I went out riding
Down that old eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking
With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon

Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you

Johnny Cash,"As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow 
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow 
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation 
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation 
After the US revolution corn planter was a chief 
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief 
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed 
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined 
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand 
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now 
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how 
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam 
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam 
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin 
It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim 
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground 
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south 
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth 
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site 
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right 
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way 
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay 
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea 
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring 
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling 
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time 
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine 
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill 
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill 
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow 
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow

Broke away from British rule and took a stand

We know of your lush green valleys
We're comin' to claim you, to tame you""

",Begin West Movement
Johnny Cash,"But the land was already claimed by a people
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways
A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota

Big Foot was an Indian chief
Of the Minneconjou band
A band of Minneconjou Sioux
From South Dakota land

Big Foot said to Custer
""Stay away from Crazy Horse""
But Custer crossed into Sioux land
And he never came back across

Then Big Foot led his people
To a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded
By the 7th Cavalry

Big chief Big Foot
Rise up from your bed
Minneconjou babies cry
For their mothers lying dead

Big Foot was down with a fever
When he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners
Of the 7th Cavalry

Two hundred women and children
And another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace
But peace did not begin

An accidental gunshot
And Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles
You could hear the babies cry

Big chief Big Foot
It's good that you can't see
Revenge is being wrought
By Custer's 7th Cavalry

Then smoke hung over the canyon
On that cold December day
All was death and dying
Around where Big Foot lay

Farther on up the canyon
Some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favorites
Women, men, and children died

One side called it a massacre
The other a victory
But the white flag is still waving
Today at Wounded Knee

Your Minneconjou band
Is more than remembered here
In South Dakota land

And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies

Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
""I have seen"" he said, ""A water bigger than the big sea water
Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it""

Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning

And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people

And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities

Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful

And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder

And I was a proud one the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey I could not bear
Oh goodbye softly sweet one...

Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm

Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (but she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (left it all and caught a train)

Johnny Cash,"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash

I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle

Johnny Cash,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying

When love is gone and the one you thought would stay
Does you wrong, and you're left alone to pay
The price is high
But somehow you'll survive, don't give in

Johnny Cash,"My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again

Johnny Cash,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
Roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now you gonna die!""
Yeah that's what I told 'em

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah he said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue""
Yeah what could I do, what could I do

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
Called him my Pa, and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed

I took a shot of cocaine and away I run

I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me

Like a knight in some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I, if I have been unkind
I just hope you will let it go by
And if I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out to me

But I swear by this song
And by all I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to be

I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me, ""Don't ask for so much""
And a young woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me, ""Why not ask for more""

Like a drunk in a midnight choir

Johnny Cash,"Delia, oh, Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn't shot poor Delia
I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round 
Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there
Found her in her parlor
And I tied her to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round 
Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to
Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round 
Delia's gone

First time I shot her
I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round

But jailer, oh, jailer
Jailer, I can't sleep
'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round

So if your woman's devilish
You can let her run 
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done

Johnny Cash,"There's a place I know where the train goes slow 
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb 
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove 
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell 
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell 
And there's room for the forsaken, if you're there on time 
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes 
If you're down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist 
And I know that your name can be on that list

He was down there by the train

And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord 
Is down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer 
Never given of myself, never truly cared 
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain 
I've taken the low road and if you've done the same

Johnny Cash,"Well, I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
He said I think my country got a little off track
Took 'em twenty five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not comin' back at all
Many a good men I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', and don't mean nothin' 
Drive on

What I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
We had our sixteen's on rock and roll
And with all that fire, I was scared and cold
I was crazy, and I was wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead, but by God's grace

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', and don't mean nothin' 
Drive on

It was a slow walk in a sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home, but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got
But I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam

Johnny Cash,"I don't want no aggravation
When my train has left the station
If you're there or not, I may not even know
Have a round and remember
Things we did that weren't so tender
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

On my old guitar sell tickets
So someone can finally pick it
And tell the girls down at the Ritz I said hello
Tell the gossipers and liars
I will see them in the fire
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy
Let her blow
No regrets, all my debts will be paid
When I get laid
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

You'll be left without excuses
For the evils and abuses
Down today from years and years ago
And have yourself another toke
From my basket full of smoke
And let the train blow the whistle when I go

Johnny Cash,"With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me 
And I lifted me up with you 
So, I believe it was a road that I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember
And pain that it's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

But in my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that's my spoils of victory is you

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Everyday gets betther than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war",Like a Soldier
Johnny Cash,"There once was a man and he couldn't cry 
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies, movie love stories
For instance could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts all ran dry
Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry

His dog got ran over, his wife up and left him
After that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob

Well, his novel was refused, and his movie was panned
His big Broadway show was a flop

He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or a drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
Not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least

They all agreed sure enough, this is no cream puff
Oh, but in fact an insensitive beast

He was taken from the jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
And he cried every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried

On the forty first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

He went up to heaven, located his dog
After that, he rejoined his arm
Below all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks 
His ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out

Right down to the ground, the jail house burned down
And the earth suffered perpetual drought",The Man Who Couldn't Cry [Live]
Johnny Cash,"Lord, I've never lived where churches grow 
I loved creation better as it stood 
That day you finished it so long ago 
And looked upon your work and called it good 
I know that others find you in the light 
That sifted down through tinted window panes 
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight 
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains 

I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well 
That you've made my freedom so complete 
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell 
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street 
Just let me live my life as I've begun 
And give me work that's open to the sky 
Make me a partner of the wind and sun 
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high 

Let me be easy on the man that's down 
Let me be square and generous with all 
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town 
But never let them say I'm mean or small 
Make me as big and open as the plains 
And honest as the horse between my knees 
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains 
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze 

Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget 
You know about the reasons that are hid 
You understand the things that gall or fret 
Well, you knew me better than my mother did 
Just keep an eye on all that's done or said 
And right me sometimes when I turn aside 
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead 
That stretches upward toward the great divide

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie 
These words came low and mournfully 
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay 
On his dying bed at the close of day

Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there 
But we took no heed to his dying prayer 
In a shallow grave just six by three 
We buried him there on the lone prairie","Oh, Bury Me Not (Introduction: A Cowboy's Prayer)"
Johnny Cash,"From the hands it came down
From the side it came down
From the feet it came down
And ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell
A teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew
The tree of life grew

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From the tree streamed a light
That started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine
On whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came
Fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks
Of six-sixty-six

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down
From his side it came down
From his feet it came down
And ran to the ground
And a small inner voice
Said ""You do have a choice""
The vine engrafted me
And I clung to the tree

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set captives free
And with the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood
I clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down
From his side it came down
From the feet it came down
And ran to the ground",Redemption

Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care

But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

And spend a pleasant summer, out in New Mexico

I'll furnish you good wages, your transportation too
If you will but go with me, one summer season through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico

We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses, marching over we did go
Until we reached the logging out in New Mexico

It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hail storm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles, us cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us, out in New Mexico

She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall

Take a walk just a little ways
And as we walked, along we talk
All would be our wedding day

In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""

I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river side
And there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Oh Lord, what have I've done?""

Because she would not marry me

On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man.

See through the prison bars, Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand. 
Just twenty short years from the day you were born, you died by the hangman's hand.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did.

Well, Joe, your mother is at the Capitol, asking the governor for a stay. 
And it's hard on her, 'cause she knows where you were, on that particular day. 
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe.

Well, the telegraph wires are humming. 
Here, the governor's words come through. 
He said, ""I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, 
I'll do, I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you. 
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean.""",Joe Bean

Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I 
From the sunny mountain side

And she said don't go my darling I know twill break my heart 
When we two are far apart 

Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home 
Carry me back to old Virginia back to my old mountain home 

My mother's old and feeble and my father's getting gray 
Carry me back to old Virginia for its there I want to stay

And I told her that I'd wed her when I come back from the west

And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
If you wanna have fun come along with me

How's about savin' all your time for me?
No more lookin', I know, I've been tooken
How's about keepin' steady company?

Find me one for five or ten cents

Johnny Cash,"I never picked cotton
But my mother did
And my brother did
And my sister did
And my daddy died young

When I was just a baby
Too little for the cotton sack
I played in the dirt
While the others worked
'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs
And I made myself a promise
When I was old enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day

And the farm couldn't hold me then 
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck
And I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey
Long legged girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring
And I took it all with a gun

And I never picked cotton
Like my mother did
And my brother did
And my sister did
And my daddy died young

It was Saturday night in Memphis
When a redneck grabbed my shirt
And he said go back to your cotton sack
I left him lying in the dirt
And they'll take me in the morning
To the gallows just outside
And in the time I got
There ain't a hell of a lot
I can look back on with pride

Where the mountains lean down to the sand 
We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep 
And I stood on the cliff and held your hand

We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills 
And we loved and we laughed the pain away 
At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

Can't be sure of how's it's going to be 
When we walk into the light across the bar 
But I'll know you and you'll know me 
Out there beyond the stars

We've seen the secret things revealed by God 
And we heard what the angels had to say 
Should you go first, or if you follow me 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the day
See how the flavor stays

Johnny Cash,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues

Johnny Cash,"I was a highwayman.
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman [Live]
Johnny Cash,"On a Monday,

I got stripes,
Stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, 
Chains around my feet

Johnny Cash,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near

But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall

In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Naming her wedding day

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first

Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there ain't no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall

Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall

Johnny Cash,"My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again

Johnny Cash,"Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
Go and climb that mountain...
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
Go and climb that mountain...
Thou shalt have no Gods before me...

There were songs in old dusty books
Of love thats always been
Sweet lovers in their glory
Who are now gone with the wind
Old fashion love words spoken then
Keep coming back around again
Nothings changed except the names
Their love burns just like mine

Before my time
Before my time

And in the dim of yesterday
I can clearly see
That flesh and blood cried out to someone
As it does in me
And there was some old song that said
I love you 'til I die

Before my time
Before my time

But what the old time masters had
Is what I feel for you
Love is love and doesn't change
In a century or two
If someway they had seen and knew
How it would be for me and you
They'd wish for love like yours
And they would wish for love like mine

Johnny Cash,"Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see this opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That it's dreadful imposition
Comes blacking in my mind

And then I see a darkness
And then I see a darkness
And then I see a darkness
And then I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep

This isn't all I see

Oh no, I see a darkness

Johnny Cash,"It was on one cold winter night
When the wind blew across the wild moor
When Mary came wandering home with a child
Till she came to her own father's door
""Father, dear father,"" she cried
""Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor.""

But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of a voice did he hear
So the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn'
And he found Mary dead but the child still alive
Closely grasping its dead mother's arms

In grief, the old man passed away
And the child, to it's mother, went soon
And no one, they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage, to ruin, has gone

But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows grew over the door
Saying, ""There Mary died, once the gay village bride
From the wind that blow across the wild moor",Mary of the Wild Moor
Johnny Cash,"Is it getting better

Will it make it easier on you now

One love we get to share it
It leaves you baby if you don't care for it

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing now
It's all I've got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other and we're doing it again

You said love is a temple
Love the higher law

And put me on Death Row

The face of Jesus in my soup

All history does unfold.

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar [Mono Version]
Johnny Cash,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White

And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I ohhh ohh ohh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell

But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

Johnny Cash,"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you",I Can't Help It* (If I'm Still in Love with You)
Johnny Cash,"By the way the land is layin?
I think I?d be safe in sayin?
That over the next hill we?ll be home

It?s a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we?ll be home

From the prophets I've been hearin?
I would say the end is nearin?
For I see familiar landmarks all along

By the dreams that I've been dreamin?
There will come a great redeemin?
And over the next hill we?ll be home

By the turn the tide is takin'
I would say there's no mistakin?
That over the next hill we?ll be home

there's a place that we are nearin?
That so many have been fearin?
And over the next hill we?ll be home

When we get there we're all hopin?
That we?ll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the comin? storm

For the way?s been long and weary
But at last the end is nearin?
And over the next hill we?ll be home

Johnny Cash,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
When the lights have lost their glow you're gonna cry, cry, cry

I lie awake at night to wait till you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell you're gonna cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away you'll cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
And you'll come back for me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this and you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of all the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry","Cry, Cry, Cry [DVD]"
Johnny Cash,"Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar [Undubbed Version]

And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down

Some are born and some are dyin'
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

""And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him""",The Man Comes Around

Johnny Cash,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo.
As I walked out on Laredo one day,
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen,
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by.
""Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story.
""I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die.""

""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing.
""Once in the saddle, I used to go gay.
""First to the card-house and then down to Rose's.
""But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin.
""Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
""Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
""Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.""

""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly.
""Play the dead march as you carry me along.
""Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,
""I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""Then go write a letter to my gray-haired mother,
""An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
""But please not one word of the man who had killed me.
""Don't mention his name and his name will pass on.""

And there stands his marker, we made, to this day.

While you hang you head and cry.

That ever did arrive in your hometown.
It'll be about the saddest thing,

I'm gonna tell you one more time.
That you still could reconsider,
And come back to being mine.

It'd be hard to refuse.

On the answer that you choose.
It will be a most important piece,

As to what went really wrong.
When what it was was that suddenly,
The music was all gone.
And this man and this woman got cut off,
In the middle of our song.

I'm gonna put it to a tune.
So I'll be sending with it,
A sweet melody for you.
And not some red-hot, upbeat zinger,
That'll set your body on fire.
But a hunk of love included,
Meant to take you a little higher.
And to settle on your sweet, sweet mind,
At night when you retire.

Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red

But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

Johnny Cash,"Me and my brother was down close to the depot
When I heard the report of a pistol
I hollered, ""I wonder what was that!""

He run out and come back and he said
""That was a report of a pistol""

And I thought I was gonna faint when he said it
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Lord, I knew the President was supposed to be down the depot that day
But I just wouldn't let myself believe that he'd been shot

Me and my bother run out there and everybody was all confused
And hollering' and running' round
And I stepped up to this one lady and I said that

""Ma'am what was it really that happened Ma'am?"", and she said that
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Well, it looked like everybody felt just about as bad as I did
Everybody started drift off to home
Me and my brother did too

Then a few weeks later, I heard that the President was still alive
So I told my brother, I said, ""Hey let's get on a train
And go to that Big House up there and see how the President is""

""Let's go up there to where he's laid up hurt and sick we'd see him""
So we went on up there and that big White House
And there was a soldier boy standin' round upside, outside

And, I sidled up to him and I said to that soldier boy
I said ""Who was it that did it?
Who was it that shot the President?""
And he said that, ""It was Charlie Guiteau that shot Mr. Garfield""

And I said, ""Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man""

That soldier boy said that
Miss Lucretia Garfield was always at his bedside
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot

And he said just that mornin' that he had been at the window
And he'd overheard Miss Lucretia and Mr. Garfield talkin'
And Mr Garfield said, ""Crete, honey"", he called her Crete

He said, ""Crete, honey, if somethin' worse would happens to me""
He said, ""You get yourself a good man""
And she said, ""Now James"", she called him James

She said, ""James, I won't hear to that now
'Cause I love you too much""

And he said that ""You'll make some good man a good wife, good wife
You'll make some man a good wife gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life, good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life""

That's what he said, ""Don't pull in single harness all your life""

Well a little while later, we come back around there
And things have changed
The flag was hangin' halfway up the flagpole

And everybody was cryin' and standin' 'round sad
And I walked back up to this soldier boy and I said
""Soldier boy, is he, is Mr Garfield?"" and he said, ""Yeah, he's gone""

Gonna lay him by that cold lonesome branch down low
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
Oh, Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low

Have you heard the news?
Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low, Lord

And when the papers
Were all signed, and a million copies made,

Bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed

In the streets below were dancing round and round

Johnny Cash,"Last time we were here at Folsom Prison, they were hanging Joe Bean. 
Is Joe still here, Joe Bean? Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right? 

Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for killing a man in Arkansas. 
Funny thing about it, Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas. 
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man. 
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday.

See through the prison bars, Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand. 
Just twenty short years from the day you were born, you died by the hangman's hand. 
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for a shooting that he never did. 
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did. 
Well, Joe, your mother is at the Capitol, asking the governor for a stay. 
And it's hard on her, 'cause she knows where you were, on that particular day. 
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe.

Well, the telegraph wires are humming. 
Here, the governor's words come through. 
He said, ""I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do. 
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you. Happy Birthday, Joe Bean.""",Joe Bean [Live]
Johnny Cash,"After seven years behind these bars together
I'll miss you more than a brother when you go when you go
If only I had not tried to escape
They'd barred me with you I know yes I know

Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
And don't let them know I never will be free be free
Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
And send a picture of mother back to me

Say hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
But stay with me just another minute or so or so
After all this sweating blood together
Who'll be my fighting partner when you go when you go

The hardest time will be on Sunday morning
Church bells will ring on Heaven Hill Heaven Hill
Please ask Reverend Garrett to pray for me
And send a picture of mother if you will

Johnny Cash,"Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel,
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well.
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees

I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the breeze.
I found myself surrounded; one policeman said: ""That's him.
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m.""

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
I said: ""What the hell did I do?""
He said: ""Shut up and sit down.""

Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Ah, shut up.""
Well, I sure was in a fix.

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so;
I ain't bein' treated right.""

Well, they're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.

Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
At 8 a.m. they let me out, I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!""
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.

They're bound to get you.

And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to Saint Louis later on (down the river)

I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf

Johnny Cash,"Beside a singing mountain stream
Where the willow grew

Where the silver leaf of maple
Sparkled in the morning dew
I braided twigs of willows
Made a string of buckeye beads
But flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

I leaned against a bark of birch
And I breathed the honey dew
I saw a North-bound flock of geese
Against a sky of baby blue
Beside the lily pads
I carved a whistle from a reed
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

A cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the song
Then the sun went slowly down the west
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my mind and spirit feed
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

So when this day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew everything I touched
Would wither and would die
And love is all that will remain
And grow from all these seeds
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need",Flesh and Blood [From the Movie I Walk the Line]

But he's gt the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues

Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

And I thought I was gonna jump with joy

Johnny Cash,"Now you know some fellahs, they want fame and fortune
Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit.
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

chorus:
Hey, John you walk the line,
Do ""Deelia"" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine.

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
(That's what I said)
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
I said, ""I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.""
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
I said ""I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

(chorus)

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!

He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars. 

It was white port, that put that look in his eye 
That grown men get when they need to cry 
And he sat down on the curb to rest 
And his head just fell down on his chest 

He said ""Every single day it gets 
A little bit harder to handle and yet"" 
And he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered 
And the words just rolled off down in the gutter 

Well he was elevator man in a cheap hotel 
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell 
He's old in years beyond his time 
Thanks to the world, and the white Port wine 

So he says ""Son,"" he always called me son 
He said, ""Life for you has just begun"" 
And he told me a story that I heard before 
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore 

Well he could cut through the years to the very night 
When it ended, in a whore house fight 
And she turned his last proposal down 
In favor of being a girl about town 

Now it's been seventeen years right in line 
And he ain't been straight none of the time 
Too many days of fightin' the weather 
And too many nights of not being together 

So he died

Well when they went through his personal affects 
In among the stubs from the welfare checks 
Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door 
An address in Dallas, and nothin' more 

The welfare people provided the priest 
A couple from the mission down the street 
Sang Amazing Grace, and no one cried 
'Cept some woman in black, way off to the side 

We all left and she was standing there 
Black veil covering her silver hair 
And 'ol One-Eyed John said her name was Alice 
And she used to be a whore in Dallas

A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",Don't Take Your Guns to Town
Johnny Cash,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all

A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way",Hurt [Multimedia Track]

Johnny Cash,"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash
One night I had a backstage pass
To a Willie Nelson show

There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

Kristofferson got an offer for a movie
Promoters closed another deal or two
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter
And he went home the minute he was through

I moved with the mob at intermission
To the green room where you see who you can see
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
Paupers, punks and millionaires and me

And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building
In order for the beer truck to come through
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie
Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude

There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
There were women who once did and some who still would
I heard one ask, ""Did Connie come along?""

And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
Leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

I wish, you could've been there
But maybe you were

Johnny Cash,"Well I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
Didn't even touch the light switch 'cause I didn't want to see
That haggard face was staring back at me

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Yes I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Oh it's nice to go out and have a big night
But sooner or later you're got to face the big light

Johnny Cash,"Some days I think this old machine is out to get me
Some days she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week
I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who

I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me

I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules
So say a little prayer every day
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain
You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel

Johnny Cash,"There was a showdown at high noon reputations on the line
It was the good guys and the bad guys I was eight and he was nine
And I forgot to keep my back to the wall in Dodge that day
And from somewhere behind me I heard him say

""That's one you owe me I let you slide
I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
But just remember you owe me one""

It was high school and football on two different teams
I was good but he was better than I would ever be
And when I finally crossed the goal line ahead of him that day
As the crowd was goin' wild I heard him say

""That's one you owe me I let you slide
I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
But just remember you owe me one""

She was long and lean and pretty and soon to be his bride
When she strayed into my arms one day with lovin' on her mind
Well I was almost tempted by her soft touch and her sigh
But the next time I saw him I could look him in the eye

That's one you owe me I let you slide
I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun

It's not the oven or the heat
That makes this bread so good to eat
It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete

""The Bad Seeds performed Cindy regularly in their live sets in 1990,and indeed on a TV appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song, but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as 'Sydney'. I think The Bad Seeds often sang 'Come on home, Sydney Cindy' -Maurice

Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me
I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
Told them that I love you, they all know its true
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
Need you in the evening when supper time is through
What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
If only you would love me say it and tell me so
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world

Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy

Johnny Cash,"About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man

That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind
Johnny Cash,"He said ""I'll love you till I die"",
She told him ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by,
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall,
Went half-crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all,
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red
Every single ""I love you""

I went to see him just today,
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away, first time
I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know,
She came to see him one last time.
Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she would.
And it kept runnin' through my mind
""This time he's over her for good.""

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away

Bring a drink of water, no

Is my own foldin' bed
Pork salad is my bread and meat
And it will be till I'm dead

Well, I brought me a little water
In a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the boss man caught me drinkin' it
And I believe, he broke my hand

They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for a deed I did
But I dis remember what, yeah

Well another boy is down
The shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body

Johnny Cash,"Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish fool, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping he will understand

I had a woman once; she was kind, and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job till I started into drinking
And I started making music that went with the devil's band

Oh, the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
My dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
It's a lonesome life when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus, will they take me back again?

If I give my soul, will he cleanse these clothes I'm wearin'?
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath inside me, and give back my dignity?

If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again?

If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again?",If I Give My Soul
Johnny Cash,"I come from just the other side of nowhere
To this big time lonesome town
They got a lot of ice and snow here
Half as cold as all the people I've found
Every way I try to go here seems to bring me down
I've seen about enough to know where I belong

I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
On that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays
Sittin' in a park alone
So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong
Tell 'em that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's
Goin' home

Takin' nothin' back to show there
For these dues I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here
And the body I've been givin' away
Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here
Headin' for the light of day

Johnny Cash,"With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me 
And I lifted me up with you 
So, I believe it was a road that I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember
And pain that it's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

But in my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that's my spoils of victory is you

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Everyday gets betther than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war",Like a Soldier [*]
Johnny Cash,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder: 
One of the four beasts saying: ""Come and see.""

And behold, a white horse. 

There's a man goin' 'round takin' names. 
An' he decides who to free and who to blame. 
Everybody won't be treated all the same. 
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.

The hairs on your arm will stand up. 
At the terror in each sip and in each sup. 
Will you partake of that last offered cup, 
Or disappear into the potter's ground. 
When the man comes around. 

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers. 
One hundred million angels singin'. 
Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum. 
Voices callin', voices cryin'. 
Some are born an' some are dyin'. 
It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come. 

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree. 
The virgins are all trimming their wicks. 
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree. 
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 

Till Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom. 
Then the father hen will call his chickens home. 
The wise men will bow down before the throne. 
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns. 
When the man comes around. 

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still. 
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still. 
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still. 
Listen to the words long written down,

In measured hundredweight and penny pound. 
When the man comes around. 

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts, 
And I looked and behold: a pale horse. 
And his name, that sat on him, was Death. 
And Hell followed with him.",The Man Comes Around [Early Take][*]

I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue, pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face

But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way

I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk

I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self

With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me

But I am living still.

Where steel and water did collide

Johnny Cash,"An old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I ohhh ohh ohh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Said: ""Steve, you're way behind time,
""This is not 38, this is Ol' 97,
""Put her into Spencer on time.""

Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman,
""Shovel on a little more coal.
""And when we cross that White Oak mountain,
""Watch Ol' '97 roll.""

And then a telegram come from Washington station,
This is how it read:
""Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97,
""Is lyin in old Danville dead.""

'Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour,
The whistle broke into a scream.
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
Scalded to death by the steam.

From this time on and learn.

Johnny Cash,"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move out over a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues [*]
Johnny Cash,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillac's

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

This is the cotton mouth
In the pyscho-billy Cadillac come on

And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there red ryder

And picked it up, it's cheaper that way

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

And it echoed thru the canyon like

Johnny Cash,"Sam Stone came home
To his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas

And the time that he served
Had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in hs knee

But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew 'round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work, he'd spent his last dime

And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit, without overtime

And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
Eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearing other
People's clothes

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair

Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air

But life had lost it's fun
And there was nothing to be done
Trade his house that he bought on the GI Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes hill

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Johnny Cash,"A way out on the mountain near the sky
Hiding from the cold realities of life
Shaking that old road dust off my heels
I give my heart and mind a chance to heal

Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

A raccoon stole my minnows in the night
Thought I appreciate his need and his appetite
But unlike me he doesn't have to roam
And it's true that man can't live on bread alone

Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

It feels so good to have a simple wish
Where life and death is me and some old fish
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand
And surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand

Johnny Cash,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil [DVD]

If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

In a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar,
And the people came from all around,

And all the girls,
From there to Austin,
Were slipping away from home,
And putting jewelery in hock,

To take the trip,
To go and listen,
To the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat-top box,
And he would play.

Well, he couldn't write or wrangle,
And he never cared to make a dime,
But give him his guitar,
And he'd be happy all the time,

And all the girls,
From nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him don't stop,
And hypnotized,

And fascinated,
By the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat-top box,
And he would play.
Then one day he was gone,

And no one ever saw him 'round,
He vanished like the breeze,
And they forgot him in the little town,
But all the girls,

Still dreamed about him,
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked,
And then one day,
On the hit parade,

Johnny Cash,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who is long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man In Black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changin' everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black",The Man in Black [DVD]

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall
She changed with the weather like the leaves I recall
She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
A two timin' woman with a heart of solid stone
She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little undergrown

Well she drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam
She never changes course she just goes along that same ol' way
Well I hope she keeps a driftin' rolls back home someday
Cause if I ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
And tell her now sit there woman you ain't leavin' no more

And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried ""Lord there must be a surer and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday""

I'd be a legend in my time.

So, it would sure would be nice if I could get my breath

Put me in my box on the 309

Take me to the depot, put me to bed
Blow an electric fan on my gnarly ol' head
Everybody take a look, see, I'm doin' fine
Then load my box on the 309
On the 309, on the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

Hey, sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hoot-and-nail for my journey now
On the 309, on the 309

I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
Hitman, take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's the 309
It's the 309, it's the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since Jubilee morn'
Talk about luck, well, I got mine
Asthma comin' down like the 309

Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile, I will be doin' fine
Then load my box on the 309

I have been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courtin'
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow

It's little heart is filled with pain
And Daddy cried they're taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train

I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train

As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train

It's hard to know she's gone forever

A flower not fading nor falling apart,
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm.

Johnny Cash,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking.
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing.
Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.

Johnny Cash,"What is man that you are mindful of him Lord
You made the stars, you made the sun
And all the worlds that came to be at your command
What is man? What has he done?

Then you crown him with glory and with honor
Give him dominion over land and sea and air
And store up an inheritance in heaven
Oh what is man that you would care?

What is man that you would let him live at all
To shed the blood of his own kind
And ever fail to even follow where you call
What is man? Why do you mind?

Yet you crown me with glory and with honor
Give me dominion over land and sea and air
And store up my inheritance in heaven
Oh, what is man, that you care?
What is man, Lord, that you would care?

Johnny Cash,"Did you walk another mile, turn a frown with a smile?
Did you lift the lowly heart about to break?
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted?
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break?
Did you sow the proper seed? Are you keeping out the weeds?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Will you be one of the meek, did you turn the other cheek?
Would you give a little more than you would take?
Did you shine your little light upon the children of the night?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted?
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break?
Did you sow the proper seed? Are you keeping out the weeds?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Johnny Cash,"The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
And asked me if I could forget

I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it's pedals will fall
In the shadow of undying pain

You can teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You can teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget",When I Stop Dreaming [#]
Johnny Cash,"Two times of loneliness and heartbreakin' despair and sadness
I've always found that a good song of inspiration lift me up
Makes me feel, just a little bit better

Who, at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near
Entrance within, demanding
Who is the voice, I hear

Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If Thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with Thee

Johnny Cash,"There's a wildwood in the pines where the family used to gather
There's a little shady grove where they built a country church
They was singing in the ground Baptisin' in the river
Glory! Hallelujah, brother! Sweet salvation there was found

So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the
land that lies up yonder
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' hallelujah!
I believe that Jesus loves me I can feel it in my soul

There's a long and windin' road that I long once more to travel
There's a home place in my heart sittin' high upon a hill
There's a rosewood rockin' chair and a place set at the table
Guess I better have a little talk with Jesus Maybe he can take me there

So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the
land that lies up yonder
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' hallelujah!

Johnny Cash,"Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you",I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You [*]
Johnny Cash,"In a vine covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
There's a dear one who's weathered life's sorrow
It's that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine

I know it's too late, dear old Daddy
To repay for the heartaches and cares
But dear Mother is waiting in Heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Your hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
Ooh, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
And take me home
What joy will fill my heart

Then I will bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
