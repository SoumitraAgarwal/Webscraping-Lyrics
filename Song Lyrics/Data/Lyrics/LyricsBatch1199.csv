Tammy Wynette,"It's knowing you don't try to bind my freedom
With some promise made of gold
That for you my door stays open
And our love becomes a simple to a-street

And it's knowing we're not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on some column now that binds us
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I'm driftin' through the market place and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might walk for hours tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you moving on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

The shadows freak in the autumn winds
That make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross legged night I sit and watch
The endless chase of leaves across my yard

And layin' down my hair brush
I lean back within my window seat and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind
Tammy Wynette,"See the tree how big it's grown
But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
The first day that I planted, it was just a twig.

Then the first snow came and I ran out
To brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt myself
And you laughed till you cried.

Yes, you were always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved you so
You surprised me with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago.

And you could sure embarrass me
When you came home from working late 'cause you would know
That I'd been all alone and cryin'
Over some sad and lonely late, late show.

And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could.

I wrecked the car and I was sad
And so afraid that you'd be mad, but what the heck
All afternoon you stormed around
But I knew how to cool you down, I hugged your neck.

You came home unexpectedly
And caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing, I went away.

And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could.

One day you were not at home
While I was there and all alone, the angels came
Guess you thought it strange of me
To leave the way I did that day, it was a shame.

But now your laughter just began
And even though you miss me hon, you must go on
And when the snow fly passes overhead
And cries down on my flower bed.
You know you're not alone.

See the tree how big it's grown
But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
The first day that I planted, it was just a twig",Honey (I Miss You)
Tammy Wynette,"Kiss away, kiss away;
Guess that's all that's left to say.
Please come back
And kiss these tears away.

Smile again, let me smile again.
Make this life worth livin' again.
Please come back
And kiss these tears away.

Only you can change
These sad and blue days.
Only you can
Make them I-love-you days.

Kiss away, kiss away;
Still, there's nothing left to say.
Please come back
And kiss these tears away.

Only you can change
These sad and blue days.
Only you can
Make them I-love-you days...",Kiss Away
Tammy Wynette,"Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie and Clyde

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dyin' or dead
Some say that Clyde, made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growin' smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growin' closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

Two years of runnin' was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie and Clyde
(Bonnie and Clyde)

Tammy Wynette,"My little girl said mommy the school room breaks my heart
Arithmetic reminds me that you and dad's apart
Subtraction starts me breaking up cause him from us leaves too
And with our home divided now I cry a lot in school

Don't make me go to school no more and cry through every test
I'm so ashamed when children see the teardrops on my desk
Imagine how you feel to hear your child say this to you
Don't make me go to school no more and make the fifth grade blue

It's hard to see my lessons the blackboard's one big tear
And when I turn wet papers in Miss Dickens only stares
So please may I be absent mom like daddy is from home
I'd rather fail than face the class they know my daddy's gone
Don't make me go to school",Don't Make Me Go to School
Tammy Wynette,"Forever yours I'll always be please say that you'll give your sweet love to me
Forever yours my love will be I will take care of you say that you love me

I started living the day I found you I love you with all my heart say you love me too
I will stay beside you and I will guide you forever yours please say you are mine
Forever yours I'll always be...

",Forever Yours
Tammy Wynette,"Accidentally in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you

Yes everything I need
I stayed just long enough to fall in love with you",I Stayed Long Enough
Tammy Wynette,"Darling I've learned how much your heart can cry and yearn
Two lips can pray for your return at last I've learned
Yes yes I've learned the haunting melancholy blues
The heartache when I long for you at last I've learned
Since you've been gone I've been stayed at home
And in this lonely solitude I've lived over each moment with you
Yes I've learned I loved I loved I loved you so
Awful so wrong to let you go yes I've learned
Since you've been gone...",I've Learned
Tammy Wynette,"If I could again be a little girl still clinging to mom's apron strings
I'd fall in love only with my toys that my daddy every weekend would bring
I'd live in a world of just make believe and I'd never come close to reality
If I could again be a little girl then I wouldn't be lonesome and I wouldn't be hurtin' 
And I wouldn't be cryin' over a big boy like you

But I never more can be a little girl for little girls fall in love and move up away
Your love turned out to be just like my toys that my mommy got up and gave away
Now I live in a world of old memories for each day I have to face reality
I'm a girl all alone but not a little girl

So that's why I'm lonesome and that's why I'm hurtin'
And that's why I'm cryin' over a big boy like you",If I Were a Little Girl
Tammy Wynette,"I keep intending to tell you I been lonely much too long
And some morning you will wake up and find the note that says I'm gone
I've tried so long to say I'm moving to greener pastures down the line
I keep intending to tell you but it keeps slipping my mind

I've got it on my lips to warn you I've been lonely my last time
And when you wake up in the morning you'll find me gone and lose your mind
I'd like to say that I'll be moving

I would have, thinking of the words I'll say
If I could keep old memories from always headin' in my way
I've come so very close to saying my lovin' is a waste of time
I keep intending to tell you but it keeps slipping my mind",It Keeps Slipping My Mind
Tammy Wynette,"
I know you like the night life, the parties and the fun.
You like to hang around until the last song has been sung.
So I have made arrangements, and I wanted you to know 
when all the laughter's ended there's still somewhere you can go.
 
My arms stay open all night, from sundown 'til the morning light, 
hoping you can find where you belong. 
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed.
You're the only love it knows. 
The one dream I have is to hold you tight.
My arms stay open all night.
Oh, yeah.
 
Please don't think I'm crazy, I haven't lost my mind.
But when it comes to loving you I can always find the time.
So if it's after midnight or just before the break of day,
any time you need me it'll never be too late.
 
'Cause my arms stay open all night, from sundown 'til the morning light, 
hoping you can find where you belong. 
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed.
You're the only love it knows. 
The one dream I have is to hold you tight.
My arms stay open all night.
Oh, yeah.
When your so-called friends go home, 
you don't ever have to be alone 'cause
 
My arms stay open all night, from sundown 'til the morning light, 
hoping you can find where you belong. 
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed.
You're the only love it knows. 
The one dream I have is to hold you tight.
My arms stay open all night.
Ooh.
My arms stay open all night.
 

",My Arms Stay Open All Night
Tammy Wynette,"If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream oh don't you sometimes think it's real

But it's only false emotions that you feel
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep gettin' bluer with each song

Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your head down and go on and cry
If your heartaches seem..",Cry
Tammy Wynette,"I was a waitress in a barroom,
No future in sight,
And he was just lonely,
When he came there that night.

Then someone played the jukebox,
And he asked me to dance,
And when he softly held me,
I thought, it's my chance.

To be good like I want to be,
That's what he's saw in me.
Not just a girl on the wrong side of town,
Good like I used to be, he brought it out in me.
And that's when I promised,
That I'd never let him down.

Now I'm back here in a barroom,
A waitress again.
The good world I've lived in,
Just came to an end.

For temptation comes easy
To a woman like me.
And regardless of my chances,
I know that I'll never be.

Good like I used to be;
I guess it's just not in me.
With all my heart how I wish I proved
I've been good like he wanted me.

But good is what I'll never be,
And now I know that he's gone for good...",Good
Tammy Wynette,"I'll live every day for you and I'll breath ever breath for you
So if I'm mean and make you blue it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue and it breaks your heart in two
I can't help the things I do it's my way of loving you

Try to understand my love look into my heart
Don't you know I'd want to die if we ever part
All my life I'm gonna love you so there may be times it may not show
That my love for you is true it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue

It's my way of loving you",It's My Way
Tammy Wynette,"Tonight at nine we get married friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
That he's loved every woman in Jackson but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walking I'll count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Yes Jackson is a mighty small town where gossips and rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town

Yes Jackson is a mighty small town...",Jackson Ain't a Very Big Town
Tammy Wynette,"It was the third of June another sleepy dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered at the backdoor why'all remember to wipe your feet
And then she said I got the news this mornin' from Choctaw Wridge
Today Billie Joe Macallister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Papa said to mama as he passed around the black eyed peas
Well Billie Joe never had a lick of sense pass the biscuits please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow
And mama said it was a shame about Billie Joe anyhow
Seems like nothing ever comes to no good upon Choctaw Wridge
And now Billie Joe Macallister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night
I'll have another piece of apple pie you know it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday upon Choctaw Wridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Mama said to me child what's happened to your apetite
Well I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher brother Tailor dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday oh by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you upon Choctaw Wridge
She and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge
One year has come and gone since we heard the news about Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson and they bought a store in Tupelo
There was virus goin' round papa caught it and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me I spent a lot of time pickin' flowers upon Chotaw Wridge
And dropped 'em into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe
Tammy Wynette,"Hello, who's speaking?  Mama, I didn't think it was you.
I've had a hard time reaching you.
Now mama, don't start crying, don't worry, I'm all right you see.
You know how he's mistreated me.

If I'd stayed at home, what would people say?
After all that's happened, it doesn't matter anyway.
Mama, your little girl gets lonely in a big old town like this.
I wish I had my teddy bear to sleep with.

But mama, how are you?  Yes, I'll call you in a week or so.

Tammy Wynette,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

And it's a shame that neon lights will make a man lay out all night
With a girl in a bar down the street

You never meant to be that man but last night you held another's hand
Though her kisses tasted sweet that's not what made you cheat
So I'll try and explain it if I can

Where where where could you go oh when you needed love I wasn't there
And her two open arms offered love sweet and warm
Where could you go but to her

I'll forgive your one mistake if you swear it's the last you'll ever make
I let those arms you need the most take you back and hold you close

Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?
You left a year ago this Christmas and we're wondering if you miss us.
Don't know why you up and left and went away.
The kids are lonely here without you, even wrote old Santa about you.
Please don't leave them all alone this Christmas day.
Don't you miss their arms around you? Do their memories surround you?
Don't you know it's not their fault things are this way?
Why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Give them your gift of love this Christmas day.
If you could see their little faces, as round the tree they take their places,
They're looking for the biggest gift of all.
So why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

But I want a daddy like the other girls and boys

He's mine he's fine he makes a funny feeling go up my spine
And I wanna keep it like this all the time
He's got what I want when I want it he's got what I need when I need it
I'd fight a million just to keep it
Just to keep on holding to the precious love he gives me

How I hate to sit and wait when I know he's got to work late
I can't stand it can't stand it
But when he walks in and I'm in his lovin' arms again I forget it I forget it
His touch is too much he knows how to love me just enough and I love him I love him
My man understands he holds me in the palm of his hand
And I wanna keep it like this all the time

Tammy Wynette,"The nights were dark and long
I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still
My dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you

I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you

I could have loved another
But I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you
Till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you

I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded

Tammy Wynette,"There lives a little boy in the house next door to me
And as usual his mommy was gone
So he came over this morning and sat down next to me
And asked why does mommy leave me alone.

But he'll find out someday why his mommy stays away
And why a woman needs arms to hold her tight
And that she would stay at home and not leave him all alone
If his daddy didn't stay away at night.

[Chorus]
He said I wish I had a mommy like you just like you
To hold me in her arms the way you do
When I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And I ask for a mommy like you.

Though a tear fell from his eye he was trying not to cry
I said don't worry everything will be all right
So you just wait and see and I held him close to me
Just like I held his daddy last night.

And I ask for a mommy like you...",I Wish I Had a Mommy Like You
Tammy Wynette,"Seems every time you come home that you never see
These lovin' arms that always wait so true
Your wonderin's like a fave you're always on the run
To sip the wine with women that don't love you
I guess it's been the romance that keeps your heart from longing
And keeps it on your mind that I'm the lovin' kind
I'm the lovin' kind

They can't feel like I feel when they're holdin' you
And way down deep I think you know I've tried
And they can't love like I love so I'll keep hanging on
And forget my part to keep you satisfied
I guess it's been the romance",The Lovin' Kind
Tammy Wynette,"My little girl was playing with her friend from down the street
She took her by the hand and said there's someone you should meet
And then they went into her room to play another game
She picked up all her dolly's and told them all by name

I listened as she said their names here's Betty Sue and Kay
Jack and June and Mary Jo and then I've heard her say
This one is my Daddy Doll and she sat him on the floor
I make believe he's daddy since he don't live here no more

My daddy doll is always near to help put me to bed

I finally found peace of mind

Singin' hallelujah you don't know what good it'll do ya
Playin' around with love'll do it every time
But then one day she felt like movin' on
One goodbye and you were all alone

And it's funny I could almost hear the sound
When your whole world came tumbling to the ground
And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya
Just walked away and blew your mind

Singin' hallelujah you got what's comin' to ya
Playin' around with love'll do it every time

When you reach for me and take my hand
You take me know that you're my man

You're safe in these lovin' arms of mine

I can tell when his day has been troubled so I love all his worries away
I lay down by his side and console him and remind him our troubles are few
Then at down start his day in my own special way
There's so many things for him that I love to do
It's not things I have to do just little things I want to do
It's not things he asks of me just little things he least expects of me

I know he bought you pretty things
I know he made your world a happy place

And I remember when she loved you
And in those days you had someone to care
And through your long and lonely nights
When you needed someone, she was there

Ah, but lately you're not smiling
And I don't see that sunshine like before
I know you've tried to make it work
But I don't think he loves you any more

And I know she must have hurt you
'Cause I've seen the tears, you try so hard to hide
But if we had each other
It might just stop this hurt we have inside

Change to me and keep the change

Gwen, you're my oldest and you're quite a lady
You're my only blue eyed girl and you turn sixteen in April
And you sure made a change in my world
I'm sorry I missed the big evening, your first date and I wasn't around

Save all the secret things you did and tell me when I get to town
And on your graduation I wanted pictures to look back on
But then I wasn't there to take them, as usual I was gone
You've had to grow up much too quick and you've done it on your own
You did it without mama 'cause mama wasn't home

And Jackie, you're quite a lady too
You're just one year younger than Gwen
And there's so much that I'm missing like being mommy now and then
I remember the day you cooked your first meal, you were nine
You cooked biscuits and ham
And you called it to me how good it was 'cause I was out of town

And at the party for fathers and daughters, well, I know you felt out of place
And even the pretty dress I bought couldn't fill that empty space
And the time when you got sick and the doctors turned you down
They said they couldn't treat you with your mama out of town

And Tina, you're such a pretty girl with big almond eyes, brown
And they voted you a home coming queen when I was out of town
I know you were a beauty 'cause your sisters dressed you right
And you said it didn't matter that I was out of town that night

And the day that you joined the cheer leading team
Boy, nothing could hold you down, you yelled, ""Hip hip hurray""
Over the phone 'cause as usual I was out of town

And you've heard almost every nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's Mommy's favorite story one more time.

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your Mommy sad
'Cause, oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far a way. 

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive Mommy if she cries.

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen.

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive Mommy if she cries.

But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes this little child was something special 
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it 
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to be

For the stable's such a simple thing, no wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that",The Wonders You Perform
Tammy Wynette,"Sometimes when he comes home I'm cookin' breakfast
I haven't slept a wink all night long
I've been layin' in bed thinkin' like a woman
Wonderin' if my man's been doin' me wrong

To think he might be out with another woman
Makes my temper rise with jealousy
But all these years I've never caught him cheatin'
I guess he needs some time away from me

But when he loves me, he really loves me
There's nothin' left for me to say
Oh when he loves me, he really loves me
He loved me all the way-ay

I'm not ever gonna worry about tomorrow
As long as he makes everything alright today
I'd rather wonder a little and have his lovin'
'Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way

When he loves me, he really loves me
There's nothin' left for me to say-ay
Oh when he loves me, he really loves me
He loved me all the way-ay

Tammy Wynette,"There never was a little girl more wanted than me
I had all the love a child could ever want or need
Daddy gave me everything he could afford to buy
An' on the ceilin' in my room, he painted me a sky.

He told me not to be afraid, when it stormed outside
He said, 'In your room, sweetheart the sun will always shine'.
An' through the years of growin' up, if somethin' made me cry
It didn't seem to hurt so bad, beneath the painted sky.

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true
And no one ever says 'goodbye'
Oh, I wish that I could live again, beneath the painted sky.

Girls grow up and fall in love and that's how it is
Sometimes the men don't love 'em like their daddy's did
Sometimes the hurt's so bad, the way it is tonight
It makes me wanna be back home, beneath the painted sky.

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true
And no one ever says 'goodbye'

Tammy Wynette,"He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea;
He alone decides who writes a symphony;
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright;
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night;

He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer;
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live,
He'll always say, ""I forgive.""

He can grant a wish or make a dream come true;
He can paint the clouds and turn to gray the blue;
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end;
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend;

He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold;
He knows every lie that you and I have told.

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation

The load is just too heavy
And the road is just too long

It always turns out wrong
No, I wasn't meant to live my life alone.

After wiping my hands on my apron I read it

For mowing the yard, five dollars
For making my own bed this week, one dollar

And for raking the yard, two dollars

And a found memory flashed through my mind
And so I picked up the pen and turning the paper
Over this is what I wrote.

For the nine months I carried you
Growin' inside of me no charge
For the nights I sat up with you
Doctored and prayed for you no charge
For the toys that you chose
And for wiping you nose there's no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of my love
Is no charge.

Great big old tears in her eyes and she looked
Up at me and said mommy I sure do love you

But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.

And I were beside you 
Would you gently smile dear

The way that I held you 
And would you want me 
To hold you again

That once you did love me 
And there was a time 
You loved me no more

Tammy Wynette,"I put my little girl to bed with teardrops in her eyes
All day I've tried to comfort her and louder were her cries

I left her there to say her prayers and stepped outside the door
The prayer I heard was one I knew I'd never heard before

Please have my mommy ask my daddy to come home
Sometimes I try and get my way and mommy's so alone
She told me once that when I'm right I never should give in
So if at first I don't succeed I'll cry cry again

I know our little girl is right and we're both in the wrong
And so I've called you up tonight to ask you please come home
I can't go on or stand for long the way she cries today
And I can't go to sleep tonight because I heard her pray

It's not because your daddy is the richest man in town

Tammy Wynette,"Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rock, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Joy to the world, the Lord is come

Tamyra Gray,"I was only 17 when he
Came around and passed my way
He was the finest thing I'd ever seen
And his eyes were green
Him and the boys played basketball
While I was chillin at the park
He had a smile that could shine a light
On your darkest days
He came up to me and said
Excuse me what's your name
I was just wondering if you would like 2 get away

[Chorus]
Do you remember me?
At the age of 17
You fell in love with me
But it was never ever meant to be

Later on as we got to know each other
I just wanted this day to last forever
But as I learned more bout him
I wondered if I'd ever see him again
There was something bout the way he made me feel
It felt as though the whole world were standing still
And when we talked I could see 
He was the perfect man for me
When he took me home that night
I knew that I was gone
He walked me to my door
And that's when I started to write this song

[Chorus]

Do you remember me?
At the age of 17
You fell in love with me
But it was never ever meant to be

Do you remember me?
I was only 17
Lived my life so wild and free
But it was never ever meant to be

I fell in love the moment I laid my eyes on him
But that's just the problem
'Cause he was already in a relationship
He said he wasn't happy
It wasn't working 
And I reminded him of the way that she used to be
He said he couldn't stay and that was just the way
At the sweet age of 17

Tamyra Gray,"Pretty brown eyed girl
She's so sweet and naive
She met a boy fell in love
Carved their name out in a tree
What a perfect memory
There's a swing out by the creek
They would meet there
He put a rose in her hair
Then she kissed him on the cheek

Those were the days of innocence
When a boy just liked a girl
But we didn't know the difference
We were livin in our own world

All alone and then I close my eyes

When everything that meant anything was you
Messed things up grew up a little too fast
I knew it was much too good to last
'cause the only thing that meant anything was you

After church one Sunday morning
Near the bottom of the stairs
Hair pressed a pretty white dress
Playing a game of truth or dare
I can still hear my momma saying
Child you need to pray
I knew it was wrong 
But it's been so long
Since I felt that way

You and I two fireflies enchanted by the night
When I see a rainbow dance across the sky
I feel all warm inside 
I get teary eyed
Makes me think about you and I

Tamyra Gray,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

Quand on baise c'est des putes à cent feuilles, pas nos cinq doigts

Nous on veut s'en mettre plein les fouilles
Mais petit j'te l'ai dit cent fois, personne n'est sans failles

Infidèle, madame misère est trop frêle et beaucoup trop laide
Faut qu'on s'entraide, faut du profit
Frelot pour qu'on reste au beau fixe
Faudrait moins d'flingues et plus de fric
Carcéral vécu, chez nous y'a pas d'sécu
Rien qu'on nous persécute
Mais tu vas perdre face a Belzébuth
Si t'as fait de belles études
C'est mieux qu'une grosse peine, sais-tu
Que faire du bitume
C'est voir des frères qui s'entubent ou qui s’entre-tuent?
Enculé, moi j'ai grillé ton plan macabre
Plus de jeunes à la morgue ça fait moins de jeunes à la barre
La vie que j'ai tu la connais par cœur vu que c'est partout la même
Je baiserai la France jusqu'à ce qu'elle m'aime

On trouve des combines
On est combien à vouloir compter des sse-lia par centaines

Imbécile tu fais qu'une mère déçue quand tu niques la justice

Si tu rechignes protège ton sternum

On s'endurcit parmi les impulsifs
On prend pas de raccourcis

On rêve tous de tires à 40 millions d'dollars
Et de pouf coopératrice qui aura sûrement pas son mot à dire
Alors pour y parvenir tous les moyens sont bons
Dans cette course au bifton faut pas ralentir
Avant qu'tu puisses un jour t’amortir
T'imagines bien qu'dans mon 9-3 on sait y faire
Qu'ce soit dans l'sport ou l'ter-ter
Dis toi bien qu'on t'nique ta mère
On est tous fiers en bas d'nos tours
Mais c'bâtard veut nous foutre au trou
Maintenant comment son p'tit va pé-cho son bout?
On est pertinemment conscient d'tous nos échecs scolaires
Mais tout serait différent si la Sorbonne serait domiciliée à Auber'
Mais non, putain d'merde tu voulais m'la mettre à long terme?
Viens faire un tour dans mon 9-3 si tu l'aimes tellement
Là où les montagnes de coke viennent droit de la Colombie
La où les zombis sont plus présents qu'en Haïti
Elle est hardcore cette vie
Mais j'laime à mort cette pute
Peux tu t'permettre d'être abattu sans qu't'aies fait une thune?
A mort la vertu!
En tant que vacateur et acteur actif de mes déboires
J'ai eu trop peur qu'il ai fallu que je me mette à boire
Toujours pas disque d'or mais toujours trop d'choses à dire
Trop de choses à fuir
Que je dors même plus quand j'dors
T'as vu dans mon département c'est comme partout
Y'a des fils qui virent mal et des filles qui finissent dans des boîtes à partouse
Heureusement que c'est pas général, 'a aussi des gens qui taffent
Des petits frères qui mettent des baffes aux BACs
Et des noich' qui taffent au black

It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.

I saw you walking underneath the stars;
I couldn't stop 'cause I was in a car.
I'm sure the distance wouldn't be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are.

I thought I knew him but I couldn't say.
I stopped to think if I could place his frame.
When he tipped his hat I knew his name.

Tangerine Dream,"When I talk to the trees
O great trees who have learned to speak slowly
I know that they believe that they have an answer
Then I walk in the city where I cannot hear it

When I talk to the city
I have already learned three answers
Before I call the question
And slowly, I wish myself among trees
But can not hear myself wishing

When I talk to the people
Who are the trees that grow in the city
They reply with a fond kindness, slowly
But there is no answer

Creating dreams that pass you by.

You may live through your life a long long time
But you will never know from where it came,
Yet all you've seen is what you've wanted to,
You're walking forward as you look behind,
Still watching those old memories fade and die

This door is heavy, and is deeply stained,
With wasted tears, that try to fight in vain,
You may be sitting, feeling quite secure,
But listen carefully, and this key is yours 
For we can lead you far beyond that door

There are dangers hidden, trust in that language
And it is precisely this conception that which must not be changed
The epitome of our language is patterns containment of thought and sound

I die to fight!!
I die to fight!!

Und der das all zusammenhaelt and

Der geist steht auf the spirit rises
Und seine feine zerstieben
And his enemies dissintegrate

Und die Ihn hassen and those who hate him
Fliehen vor seinem angesicht flee from his sight

Und leben entsteht and life begins to form

What the hammer? What the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?

Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

Tangerine Dream,"I wander thro' each charter'd street
Near where the charter'd Thames does flow
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe
In every cry of every Man
In every Infant's cry of fear
In every voice, in every ban
The mind-forg'd manacles I hear:
How the Chimney-sweeper's cry
Every black'ning Church appalls
And the hapless Soldier's sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls
But most thro' midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlot's curse
Blasts the new born Infant's tear
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse

Rise and look out; his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open
And let his wife and children return from the oppressor's scourge
They look behind at every step and believe it is a dream

And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear and cloudless night

And there is a smile of deceit;
And there is a smile of smiles
In which these two smiles meet.
And there is a frown of hate,
And there is a frown of disdain;
And there is a frown of frowns
Which you strive to forget in vain,
For it sticks in the heart's deep core,
And it sticks in the deep backbone;
And no smile that ever was smiled,
But only one smiles alone
That betwixt the cradle and grave
It only once smiled can be;
But when it once is smiled
There's no end to misery.",Smile

Tanglefoot,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",Gift
Tango Group,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea

Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Que me sorprende el corazón
Todo se rompe, todo estalla
Y algo acaba de morir

Para sentir otra manera de ser feliz
Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir
Lo que hasta ayer era reír

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar
Qué nuevo amor será
Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar
Adiós infancia, ojalá que te recuerde
En mi vejez, con amor

Softly shines the moon clear and bright

Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon

Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn’t speak, though I’d love to say
That you’ve stolen my heart away

Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you’ll cherish dear, through the passing years

'Cause you know I laugh when winter shows her hand
Well, that picture framed the saddest thing you'll see
But it bought me time and a place that love could be
And since I'm going now please rearrange

'Cause I'd like to think that things have changed
I don't believe you'll be open anymore

Tell me if, you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
And tell me if you want to catch that feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption doesn't do much for me

Well, everyone was hoping you would stay a while
Tell us 'bout that great land in the south
I see that man - now ain't he under offer?
I tell you child you go wash out your mouth

Tell me if, you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
And tell me if you want to catch that feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption doesn't do much for me

I'm hiding in the belfry
What can you say - I want to catch time
How can you say you know anything about me
Well I knew about you - but I won't care about you

Everyone has come to see. Well somethings have to do

It's taken with looks
It won't tell a story

Ain't the first of mine

Out in the cold
Maybe I love you

Out to just win

Been shot from the start
Feel shot when I'm feeling drained
But we all know how to smile when we're falling apart

But some of us sometimes, are just thrilled, by meeting the blessed

Makes like a twinge running straight through my head
Maybe this fortune is not what it seems
Some of us pin, some of us pin time on our dreams

And saved from the talk shifts
Went straight to your goal
Straight backed and straight laced
Well, you never really 
Do you ever really know?

I checked out the view
I checked all the soft land

Why'see all the words were lost
Yes, all the words were lost

And you can stand upon your own life

You still stare up towards the toss

Just to take me home
To your serious house, with your serious tones
You're a serious man, with a serious smile
But the summer is hot and I might surprise you
In a very short while we'll have left them behind
With their faces quite pained
As they try to remind themselves
Oh, it's really so wrong
It's really so out
And it's really not cool to take a young girl about
And I know the young man with a century's face
A philosopher king - he will try to amaze
With examples of love and examples of hate
And to see them explode
We will just have to

It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine
You know it's alright to be trustful, have tact
But the problem's complex
When you keep holding back
We could talk for an hour
We could talk for a day
But the people we know would still have their say
Talk of such virtuous women
Talk of such noble men
But if I'm on the level I have met none of them
Oh, I've met troubled people with deep and dark thoughts
Who have hallowed my name
And sworn I will get caught
But why waste real feeling and
Why waste our time
To let the earth bow to no virtue of
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine
You know it's alright to just make mistakes
But to tail in with hurt - is the gravest make
We all create lives which we don't understand
But to point the accused is a job for no man
And we curse our own longing - and curse our own ways
I won't be satisfied with my soul that's

It grows better all the time

Now I've told you about mine

Tanita Tikaram,"Well I might be politic
Or I might just grab your hand
I'm not selfish with my story
I just want something, understand

It's not grieving for my cry
And I hate this growl inside
And you better believe it when I tell you
That it's all growing
Until you learn to trust
Well this wash it wasn't easy
No this wash just doesn't dream
It just makes the whole thing cluttered, yes
And when you've seen the sights it's best to scream
I'm not stolen from the souless
I'm just driven to the white

You really ought to join the fight

Well, no one likes the dark
And we just checked in for higher love
Well, that's another - you like sparks
Well, I'll fly across the evening
Least, I'll smile across the hall to you

It beter just be wall-to-wall

That you ever wanted to hear - it's

And I'm tired of this courtyrad
And every grateful day's the herdline
Well, the crafty were just leaving
They've forgotten how to talk
And that slither through the evening
Was just another kind of walk with me

Is only striking hot for you

Or entertain your kind

Is 'cause I think you maybe, a heart attack is blind

And checking out your resume
And making out your plans

You said it, I'm just the half of this, that just won't see
Believe it if I am wishing, I am hoping as well
Sometimes I, I tell you clearly but it's hard to tell

Someone will watch me with an eager eye
But I'm not, I'm not even here, to even try
If the rain stops calling, calling my name
Well, I'm still in the thick of it and bearing the shame

Some times are hard, some times they drag
Well, I can see your face, you've seen the half of this
Maybe I'm naming all the changes too much
But see you, you never leave it if you have to touch

And I will always be waiting with a happy smile
But the smile is just a laughing killer, laugh a while
Don't know what I'm doing here, don't know if I'm sane
But I swear if I'm feeling this, I'm feeling the pain

And growing harder to keep you crowned

Some movement cries
Some will and won't
Some he has shown me love

Timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Cup of tea, take time to think, yea
Time to risk a life, a life, a life
Sweet and handsome
Soft and porky
You pig out 'til you've seen the light
Pig out 'til you've seen the light

Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety",Twist in My Sobriety (Tikaramp Radio)
Tanita Tikaram,"It was a lonely summer where I have been your shelter following your footsteps will you be my first regret?
Sorry if I'm foolish making myself secrets seems to come between us
And we always leave them there, my child always leave them there...

Who will love you?
Do you break my heart? do I have to go? does it mean we've loved somebody?
Now you're falling
Do we have to cheat? do we have to lie? does it mean I've loved somebody?
Who will hold you?
Do we learn to cry? do we have to hate? does it mean we've loved somebody?

Waiting in the cold like this always feeling nervous hiding in the shadows I'm sure I can't get caught you know
I can't keep together any of my thoughts how they feel but I just came round to talk, you know
Always here to talk...

Who will need me?
Do you break my heart? do I have to go? does it mean we've loved somebody?

Tanita Tikaram,"Now this isn't the party I would hold now, I'm trying to make it on my own
I have opened my house but it's not like a home without you
And I really don't want to feel that you're not here 'cause I would be

[Chorus]
Back in your arms, I would be
Back in your arms I'd keep on calling you
Yeah, I'd keep on calling you

No this isn't the season I would have chose
To be walking for miles with nowhere to go
I find shelter and warmth but I still feel the cold without you
And I really don't want to feel that you're not here 'cause I would be

Back in your arms, I would be

And as she glances through the magazine you feel somehow, she's seen you, too 

[Chorus]
All my life I thought you said 
All my life I heard you say 
It'll be all right 
(All my life) 
If you stay for all my life, for all my life

And as I place the moments in the frame it's to these, I return again

Tanita Tikaram,"I must have left my house at eight because I always do my train,
I'm certain left the station just when it was due 
I must have read the morningpaper, 
Going into town and having gotten through the editorial no doubt 
I must have frowned 

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine 
With letters to be read and heaps of paper waiting to be signed 
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so the usual place, the usual 
Bunch and still on top of this I'm pretty sure 
It must have rained the day before you came 
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two 
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue 
I must have kept on dragging 

Through the business of the day and without really knowing anything I hid 
A part of me away at five I must have left there's no exception to the rule 
A matter of routine I've done it ever since 
I finished school the train back home again undoubtedly 
I must have read the evening paper then 

Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame the day before you came 
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so 
And stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go 
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on tv there's not, 
I think, a single episode of dallas that I didn't see 
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten 

I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then 
I must have read a while the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style 
It's funny but I had no sense of living without aim 
The day before you came 
And turning out the light 

I must have yawned and cuddled up to yet another night 
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain 
The day before you came",The Day Before You Came
Tanita Tikaram,"I wore a watch today it didn't tell me the time
I saw your face today I knew you'd see through mine 
Does it help a lot? to see I'm on the spot never understood 
But I knew you yea I knew you 
But I knew you yea I knew you 
I heard your voice today turn into what is best 
I felt your soft caress turn into something less 
Don't make me sound alive don't make me sound a - hurt 
Don't make me, make - believe 
'cause I knew you yea I knew you 
Yes I knew you yea I knew you 
It doesn't make me lie doesn't make you wise 
Do not analyze ''cause I'd always cry 
Does it help a lot just to see you through ''cause, I'll never know

Not now I've walked so far
Don't let it all come down together

Although I got nothing & you got something
See I'm not fit to be an open door
Or the mat you wipe your feet upon

Don't shake me up

Lying in my bed in the afternoon
No-one for company

This is the month that puts tomorrow back
Only you got something, I got sidetracked
Just for once I'd like my lover mapped
For me to write my name upon
Please someone

Don't shake me up
Many's the time I've thought of you
Lying in your bed with the ocean view
Not me for company

Don't shake me up
There'll be a time when I'm far from you
When I will see the trick of you
And the trick of you and me

Then the burden of my heart (say something)

I let the blues creep inside me
Oh, how they would hide me

Where you are
Everyday is new, everyday is you

I hear your heart singing to me
'Cause where you are
Everyday is new, everyday is

I can't spend all my time
Just feeling let down
I can't spend no more time
Just hanging my head down

When it's so much better
To feel your love
So much better

So many years, I let pass by
Watching the sun in the morning
Without feeling the warmth on me

Now that I need, is all that I trust
I hear your voice singing to me
Where you are
Everyday is new, everyday is

I can't spend no more time
Feeling left out
I can't spend no more time
Just, never working it out

When it's so much better
To let your love in
So much better

Tanita Tikaram,"Thought I'd call you up
To make you see what's true
But nothing seems quite right
It's like I'm lying back at you

If that's the way it goes
To cut you like it does
For nothing tastes more bitter
Than the fever that you lost

Do you think that love can last forever
Do you think that love can last forever

It's not like people leave
They're really leaving you
It's just a different world
Just a different thing to do

Do you think that love can last forever
Do you think that love can last forever 

The more that you see her
The more you fall apart

You thought you were of stronger stuff my friend
A stronger heart my friend
You'd see it to the end
You're still searching in the dark

Do you think that love can last forever
Do you think that love can last forever
Do you think that love can last forever
Forever for you...

I've got to swear you off
I'm missing my people

With too much forgiveness, baby
But I hear your voice
And it sweetens mine

I've got to cool my head
You should have heard the sound
There so many rumors
They're chasing my tail
I'm almost forgotten myself
But I walked till noon
Just to find your trail

Time on my own
Believe I, believe I, I could use you
Time on my own 
Believe I'd love the company
Time on my own
Believe I, believe I, I could use you
Time on my own
Believe I'd learn to love you

I've got to give you up, oh
You watch me walking off

When the sky has found you silent
Where the color spreads into mist
Where you hide in all your silence
The very center of all our grief

Takes a little while but I'll know when I'm feeling it
Takes a little while but I'll know when I'm feeling it
Takes a little while but I know what I feel

When you call me
I'll be hanging on every word

And the magic is lost on you

From the things that I never done
All my life I'll be running
From the things that I never done
Still a fighter keeps the dream alive
If I wasn't this close to heaven
I'd be letting down the side

Lord knows I'll find a way
Through the sleepless city, its weary face
Holding you

Do you feel love is just a word I say sometimes
Do you feel love is just a word I say
For I feel so far from knowing
I feel so far from knowing
I feel so far from knowing

You've got me going, the hoop is wide
I keep believing, and what have I gained?
So play me again

You've got me running, all over town
You've got me running, so deep am I bound
To talk of love is only to flatter
Play me again
Please play me again
In the night time's wandering, that's where I hide
For in its blush I am alive
Searching for your light
Searching for you light

In the beginning, the word is hot
Now I see the ruin, but I can't stop
For I'm so sentimental

Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a La Vida

If I can spare some change

And most of the time she don't eat
She's spendin' her rent tryin' to get vent

Is he kissing you touching you holding you what
Take a drink and help ease my mind
I want to be mad after all those times

For me to ask you where you been
For you to say I better stop tripping
To grab your neck until you let me know
For you to run crying, crying out the door
To grab my coat and chase you down the street
To say it ain't you it's my own insecurity
For you to say yes I cheated on you
I won't care cause after all I put you through I deserve
I desrve yeah yeah yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
To even be lied to sometimes
Maybe you should go cheat on me

Maybe I should sit and wait by the phone
Cause I paged you about 3 or 4 times

But I never moved on 'cause my heart wouldn't let you go
Until I let you know I still believe

Throw your hands high, where all my G's at?
They all comin', to where Warren G's at

I keep my game tight, money and money and mo' money
And ain't a damn thing funny
How could I live like that? I just can
And when it comes to this game, I'm just too far advanced

Too quick to be touched, give you the head rush
To the front of the stage, like you bout to get paid
I'm lights, camera, watch you blow like grenades
I never serenade, I just party

Come on and ride with me, dip with me
Get rich with me, sip some Hennessey

Instead of makin' they bucks, bank account runnin' out of luck
Now you stuck, do deals fulfill your dreams make cream
Keep my pockets long like streams, no strings

Attached, attack any nigga plottin' on my stack
Mo bounce to this, smoke an ounce to this
Make more gold than fish, one wish
Live on top of the world

Thou shalt not waste and thou shalt not spill
Just drink your beer - Commandments
Thou shalt not puke cause there's no excuse
Just drink your beer - Commandments

Mankind was long deprived
Of the rules encased in stone
Ten written the rest were lost
When will they be found?

Laws misplaced for centuries
Where can they be? The brewery!

Rejoice I The time is now
Fulfill Your sacred vows
Pay need to the blessed stone
Respect the holy law

We sought a place to get some rest
The owner said: ""Please keep it down""

""We're good boys"" - so we lied
Raise some Hell!

Two days passed - fuckin' mess
The maids refused to clean our stys
Ravioli neath the rug
Stench of beer - everywhere

We were shit-faced - relieving stress is so much fun
Fuckin' shit-faced - getting sick and thrashing rooms

One week down - place was fucked
We tore the heater off the wall
And broke the windows in our room
No one cared - we were drunk

Raise some Hell!

Bed diving - brand new sport
From our beds we'd start to leap
And dive into the cabinets
They broke too - nothing spared

Went downtown - forgot the keys
We climbed into someone's window
But they shot teargas in our eyes
Didn't look - locked outside

Raise some Hell!

Place destroyed - where to now?
We moved into another room
Five minutes passed and it was thrashed
Last warning - they kicked us out

In a world of the silver moonlight
Living beyond the grave
From the cold of the earth I will rise

Unseen, and cloaked in shadows
When I crawl over cryptic ceilings
Modern to Gothic times
Eating souls of the mortal beings

You can't get home without a car

Tankwart,"Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, dann ist die Welt voll Sonnenschein!So gut wie wir uns heute verstehn, so soll es weitergehen!Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, dann kommt das Glück von ganz allein!Drum singen wir tagaus und tagein: Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein!
Heut nacht feiern wir,
Machen durch bis um vier.Fragen nicht nach Zeit und Geld,weil es dir und auch mir so gefällt.
Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, ...
Draußen wird's langsam hell,und die Zeit geht viel zu schnell.Noch ein Glas und einen Kuß,ja, und dann ist noch lange nicht Schluß.
Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, ..

Psych myself up 
That's the way it's gonna be 

Why can't I move 
I'm tied up here 
He said I've seen this pain before 
Sometimes I want to disappear 
Got to tell ya I'm feeling paranoid

What you gonna do 
What you gonna be 
When they're coming after me 
I know that I'm feeling the lonely one

Smoking away

Inside your head 
Numbness instead 
Until your thinking finds a cure 

Why bleed for the wicked

Got to stand up 
Psych myself up

Tantric,"Watch the time 
Passing by 
Seeing strangers in the sky 

Rusty eyes 
Stare and bleed 
Hope the hell that you do not see 
Something in this world needs to change 
Yeah 

Hear the lies 
See their eyes 
Morally how we compromise 

Stained again 
By a friend 
Cut yourself back down to size 
Something this world needs to change 

[Chorus]
Another slap in the face 
I know this time of the year 
Is a revillusion 
Still I fall out of place 
Open your mind to the change Of evolution 

Look around 
There's a change 
Try to find the end of pain 

People who cause are just partly to blame 
Try to find the reason why we all stay the same 
Something in this world needs a change

Is it something we probably asked for 
All the answers are not quite clear

We walk around like we don't live with consequence

So how's it feel to run and hide for your defense 
You're not the only one to face the fight 

It's been a long time 
Believe it or not 
We've got a strong mind 
But we never remember to use it

After seein' everything 
I can't believe we still don't know 
What it is that we think we're searching for 

After we go 
It seems the same mistakes will carry on 
That's what we get for giving up

But I will keep on pushing 
I've gotta make all the time that has passed

Slowly wears us down

It's only been forgotten 'cause we fought and lost again 
I'm tired of always stumbling through it 
That's not the way to be 

Pay attention 'cause it goes away 
And don't be bothered 
By the things you can't control 

Very few things never fade away 
Let the petty things 
That dwell go where they go 

What if the life we knew wasn't dead 
It's only been forgotten 'cause we fought and lost again

Tried once but I got distracted

Sweaty palms and promises that someone slow to take in all away from me
Right now I'm livin' dreams that were dreamt by younger one
And as it spins into a web I'm gettin' caught, I'm barely able to see the sun

But to right the wrongs I'll take the long way just to find her
Way to be gone away from this

Get up again and hold it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one
Get up again and trade it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one

Look around to figure out around why certain things turn so quickly
I'm sick of all these random smiles I see, I'm all in a plastic city
I get around a moving lie just to look at another one
Oh, I don't know you anymore, I don't think I know anyone

To right the wrongs I'll take the long way just to find her
Way to be gone away from this

Get up again and hold it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one
Get up again and trade it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one

To right the wrongs I'll take the long way just to find her
Way to be gone away from this

Get up again and hold it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one
Get up again and trade it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one, the lucky one

Tantric,"Should I try and cut myself for you?
And do I have to let it bleed with no regard?
Tell me just exactly what to do?
I'm afraid that I have gone too far

'cause I don't know just what you're feeling yet
'cause I've been left out in the cold
All I know is we both share regrets
We haven't done this yet
There's nothing here we cannot change

I could never find myself without you
You could never be yourself without me
Why even try to lie or ignore the truth?
Is there someone else that I should be? No

'cause I don't know just what you're feeling yet

Back in your face, so you can see your blunder

The face in the mirror will be the one to remind you

You are what you avoid, so easily annoyed,
You ask for way too much so you can fill the void,
Of what you refuse to believe,
Can't touch or see,
I know there's something guiding me through this,
Guiding me through this

Don't be afraid 'cause he stands beside you,
Lost and alone he will be there to guide you,
Everyone has felt the way that you do,
Don't worry now 'cause everything will come through,

And so I weep

The world is young and so are you
So tap my american flu

Funny old world

Kill the wine and kiss the girl
And tonight, man, you rule the world

Falling on back again
And put an ending to this losers game
No one will play with you

So tap my american flu

Tanya Donelly,"All your friends have changed
Another moment too soon for you
The angle shifts again
Another moment too soon
Now it's time to take a walk
Now it's time to take the walk you've been side-slipping

Time to move your sorry bones up off the floor
Time to rise above your situation
Time to make sure the current pauses at your door
Time to seek your own level baby

Amazing things have strayed within your reach
Are you unfazed and unimpressed by all you could have had with ease
Amazing things have strayed within your reach
Another moment too soon for you
Now it's time to take the walk you've been side-slipping

Time to move your sorry bones...

So what if you come undone on your way to the sun
Your home-made kite melts down and out of sight
You'll find that your arms are fine and strong and move you along
And not a moment too soon

Time to move your sorry bones...



",Another Moment
Tanya Donelly,"From the dark side of the sun
My supernatural one
You fell into grace
Move slowly if not carefully
Then in silence sometimes

Blighted and solo
This is where I come in reeling
Our future waits on the field of fair play
I will meet you there someday

You come on like a sunburn baby
My runaway old flame
I know you come in peace
But I'm still afraid

From the dark side of the sun
My supernatural one
You fell into my grace
Suffer me if not gladly
Then in silence sometimes
Our future waits on the field of fair play
I will meet you there someday

You come on like a sunburn baby
My runaway old flame
I know you come in peace
But I'm still afraid

Blighted and solo
This is where I come in

I'm keeping you so realize your fate
I'm keeping you I'm keeping you

I wanted you from way back when
I wanted you for years, then years again

I'm keeping you I'm keeping you
I'm keeping you so settle in now

My return to wildlife by satellite
By beautiful moon-shining girl
Whether by hard ground or splashdown
We're safely back in the world

My heart's not new
I'm not like you
I've loved and been loved well and badly too
My body's been through everything
I've used and been used
I got over it
There's something that you learn on a tightrope
Just outside the spotlight there's a big net waiting for...

Whether by hard ground or splashdown

Bringing sleep to all

Come to steer your runaway home
I'm a moonbeam monkey on spec
Come to bring your strange kid back

No one saw him gimpy going round the bend
And no one but me knows the stuff it takes to mend him
I will get him back on the right track
I will bring your strange kid back

He saw something there, something in the ice
Sees it still when he closes his eyes
He's not talking, just taking it alone
I will bring his story home

He's not talking, just taking it alone
He's a good boy, your good son
I'm an angel dark, darker than loam
I will bring your strange kid home

Tanya Donelly,"In the beginning my love was fierce
One heart stopped and another started
I flashed my eyes, cracked wise and left them dry
Now I sit with my babe at my breast
I was never this good at my best
Never higher

The moon was paper white the night you saved my life
When my spirit guide left me behind
The wood was closing in, foggy was the night
The night you saved my life
When my spirit guide left me behind

I spy with my third eye
Something volatile and vital
So say goodnight, sleep tight, don't let them bite
Now I stand with the wind at my back
Every day brings a new breed of jackass
I was never good at monkey-in-the-middle
Never a fighter

The moon was paper white the night you saved my life
When my spirit guide left me behind
The wood was closing in, foggy was the night
The night you saved my life
When my spirit guide left me behind

Will you follow me under

If I wash up on the beach
And I've lost all memory
Will you come into the shadow with me
Will you follow me under

If I decide to bring it all down
Will you stay and help me figure it out
Will you come into the shadow with me
Will you follow me under

Anyway so much to prove
Step away from the wreck
But leave a match for my last cigarette

And I know that smile is evidence of this
And I know my picture will not be carried with you
Now someone's got to stay and clean up this mess

So much to leave
Anyway so much for me
Have you held your breath
Through this tragic display of my last laugh

Someone's got to pay for this

It will be under your spell, at your command
And when I stumble
It will be into your hand

In just trying to get it right one time
With our clothes on, we're brave
And mummified and out of sight

Better to run than play dead

But you left me, me never left you
And what me do right now, me can't even say F you
But me can say this though

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

I bet you think I'm supposed to smile, put the best outside
Put on an act to protect my pride
You want me to take it like a man, but I'm a girl who cries
So if I puncture your tires, don't be too surprised

And while I'm at it, hell, I may as well key up your car
'Cause what you did to my heart that's an act of war
Well every step you take I'll be one step behind
Won't let you get me out of your mind

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

I should allowed to be bitter 'cause it's only fair
I'm falling apart, but you don't care
Why is she so happy? Why do you smile?
And why aren't you guys fighting all the while like we did?

I know it must be a charade, God please send me a shower
To rain on their parade, I hope she's cheating juggling nuts like a squirrel
Better yet I hope she leaves you for a girl
'Cause you can't live without me

I hope you can't live without me

Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

Yo, both you know want go get married and you would love me to be there
I woulda tell you somethings, but them not fit for the ears
Usually me woulda say goodbye and I wish you well
But not to you, I hope your life turns out to be hell

Bet you think I want you to die but no, I want you to live
And suffer and cry like I did
I'm just keepin' it real
I just so me feel

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me

No, and I know you in and out like a book like me
She no full a style like me, can't make you smile like me
And she can never bear beautiful child like me

She no tight like me, no fling it up right like me
And if me buck her one her way she can't fight like me
You done know, me say ah just so it go

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me

Yes, I paid the price by look, how much I gained

Tanya Stephens,"Once upon a time there was a happy family (a sweet little baby)
There was a baby girl, a daddy, and a mommy( a sweet little baby)
Mommy had a secret she told a little white lie
And when she tucked the baby in at night, she sang her this lullaby

You got your daddy's smile, you got his eyes
I feel my heart breaking every time you cry
I'm gonna burn in hell, but its no sacrifice
Your stability is worth a million lies
I see your daddy, in everything you do
And if you could talk, I'll bet you'll talk like him too
But he can't be your daddy, I hope you understand
The man who thinks he's your father
Is a much better man
Maybe one day, you'll end up crying on Ricki Lake
But baby its a chance your momma's willing to take
'Cause I love you! even if my heart is gonna break
Ain't no reason you should suffer for my mistake

And so I lie, baby I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this
Until I hit the dirt, someday

And everyday by herself the momma cried
But at night she smiled when the daddy was by her side
There were times she almost told him, and it really broke her heart
But she forced herself to keep the secret that was tearing her apart

Now I can't sleep at night
I've lost my appetite
Everybody keeps saying
The baby looks kind of light
And I tell them that every newborn baby looks the same
While I'm praying to God, please make your color change
The emotions on his face when he's looking at you
I couldn't tell he ain't your papa even if I wanted to
He's got your picture tattooed on his arm
Now he's bragging to his friends about his firstborn
Oh God, and I love him, really I do, if he ever found out it
Would kill me too, now I'm caught between a rock and a really hard place
I'd give anything to keep that smile on his face

And so I lie, baby I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this
Until I hit the dirt, someday

Mommy kept the family together the best way she could
'Cause she knew in this case the truth would do more harm than good
What the daddy didn't know, didn't hurt him
He had no cause to fret, and that's as close to happily ever after as anyone can get

I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this
Until I hit the dirt, someday",Little White Lie

Tanya Stephens,"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to invite you on a journey
I sincerely hope you are in a mood to travel right now
'Cause we're going back in time
Are you ready?

I wanna take you way back
To when a girl on a mike?s worth
Wasn't determined by the length of her skirt
I mean way back to creativity before MTV, before BET

I mean way back before recycling shit
When the props that you got was for your writing and shit
Let's rewind before the hype when you used to be low key
To be a singer you had to actually know key

I mean way back to before people made a job
Of seeing who's best at impersonating Bob
I mean way back to when you sweat blood on every line
To get one good song didn't cost sixteen ninety nine

To be considered deep you had to actually say stuff
And if it wasn't good, disc jockeys didn't play stuff
I mean way way, Marvin Gaye way back and I pray that you will

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take me to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take you to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Well, it?s ironic that the chronic that I smoke
Got me singing shit that's bionic every note
That it?s affecting my judgment is what some people would hope
But I'm not tripping, I'm on a journey, come along now let's float

I used to be excited going to the record store
But these days I stay pacing the floor
Somebody please take me back to when the artistes were poor
'Cause when they made less they gave us so much more

let's take it back to a ballroom, cloudy microphone
Smokey Robinson, Nina Simone
James Brown was still occupying the throne
When the songs weren't sold off videos alone

Way back to when a star attitude wasn't defined
By somebody being rude
To when it was a pleasure definitely not a task
To greet a fan with a smile and sign a damn autograph

I mean way back to before you used to drive the Maybach
You dreamt about a mil but never made that
When you made some shit that we could play back

I mean way back to a whole ?nother time
Further back than your granddad?s hairline
I mean way back, won't you say that you will

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take me to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take you to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

And it came to pass in the glorious days of charts
That the music hailed and we danced to it
And threw a party but in our hearts we knew the musicians failed

And then came along brothers, Napster and Aimster
And though they were definitely wrong I think it's worse
To be forced to buy a whole bullshit album
Just to get that one good song , can I get an Amen

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take it to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take it to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Oh, what a day, oh
Day, what a day, what a day, oh, oh

I'm tired of the hunger I see on people's faces
Tired of the animosity between the races
Tired of corruption in high and low places
And pricks with money but no social graces

Tired of being judged for the style in my hair
And the music that I listen and the clothes that I wear
I'm tired of life and death being sold as a pair
And politicians who keep saying they care but

Maybe hoping for a change is a dream
Maybe life ain't as bad as it seems
But if dreaming is the best I can do
Then I'll be dreaming my whole life through

Oh, what a day when war becomes a thing of the past
And peace, we will have it at last
And life is finally worth its cost
And woah, woah, oh

What a day when men finally live what they teach
And love ain't just a concept we preach
And blood no longer runs in the streets
Woah, woah, woah, oh, what a day

Tired of leaving church, feeling like I've just been robbed
Two hours of rambling, not much mention of God
The richest man's the only one who does not have a job
A bunch of righteous freaks extorting worse than the mob, y'all

Tired of baby, momma, tired of baby, daddy
Chilling in the spot where the parents should be
Teenage mother saying, ""Leave my babies alone""
In 20 years the kid could be robbing my home but

I got a vision of a whole other plain
Where the spiritual can flourish again
I'm just awaiting for the fire to rain
Burn dung everything and start clean

What a day when war becomes a thing of the past
And peace, we will have it at last
And life is finally worth its cost
And woah, woah, oh

Oh, what a day when men finally live what they teach
And love ain't just a concept we preach
And blood no longer runs in the streets
And woah, woah, woah, oh, what a day

Ooh, what a day
Oh, what a day
Oh, what a day, what a day, what a day

Maybe life ain't as bad as it seems

verse 1
Came to your wedding uninvited 
Walk to da church and sat down inside
I wanted to scream your name
Let everybody see my pain 
When you said I do I died
And it was time for you to kiss the bride
Through tears I saw you lift her veil 
You kissed her and my world turned pale 
I thought I was apart of your life
But they pronounced you man and wife
Saw the emotion in your eyes
And in da church I started to cry

Damn you
And your wedding bells
Damn you

And if its that wat you want

So I got up and started running blindly
Had to get that painful scene behind me
The wind howling in my ears
Seem to be laughing at my river of tears
I didn't wait for you to walk my way
Or stick around until she through the bouquet
I couldnt trust my self to just sit by
And not flood the church with the tears I cried
Last night I was in your arms
You held me and kept me warm
Can't help feeling left behind
As she walks off with what you said was mine!

Verse 1:

Where Bubba grew up, kept his tobacco chewed up. 
And when they use to hang ropes, they always kept two up. 
Had crosses burning all night, like the Church blew up. 
And if you didn't look like them, they would fuck you up. 
Time passed and Bubba turned forty years old. 
And all them Jack Daniels started taking a toll. 
Seem like Bubba was about to make a final bow, none of his friends from the Klan couldn't help him now. 
Family gathered at his bed side ready to sing the blues, when a doctor rushed in and said I got some news. 
The good news is Bubba I've found you a liver only bad news is it belongs to a nigga.

Chorus: 

Do you care bout the texture of his hair or the cocoa brown color of his skin' 
Do you still care' 
Do you still give a damn, now your in the predicament your in 
Do you still care' 
Does it still mean a lot now you're the one who's needing the help' 
Do still care' 
Do you still find it hard to love your neighbor as you love yourself 
Now tell me why can't you accept me as I am'

Verse 2:

Where Bigga grew up boys were suppose to be tough. 
Girls were trophies every man always kept a few of. 
When he was hurt and the tears would sting in his eyes, his mother said ""stop the noise yuh a girl' real boys don't cry."" 
He learn in order to be a man he had to know how to fight. 
And had some very definitive rules about what's wrong or right. 
He never had the luxury of being able to choose. 
So to him for being different there was no excuse. 
Bigga was hustling on the corner, making some cash. 
When he bumped into some beef that he had from the past. 
He watched the guns raised and the bullets fly. 
In disbelief as his friends all jumped in their rides. 
Lefted him in the gutter didn't care if he died. 
He was rescued by a car with a plates that said gay pride. 
It would have been fatal that shot in your head, They saved your life tho you always said chi chi fi dead. 

Chorus:

Now do you care bout the clothes that they wear' 
Would you rather if they left you there' 
Do you still care what your friends wanna think if they see you hanging out with a queer' 
Do you still care' 
Does it still mean a lot now your the one who's needing the help' 
Do you still care' 
Do you still find hard it to love your neighbor as you love yourself' 
Now, tell me why can't you accept me as I am' 
Just the way I am now. 

Verse 3: 

And that's the reason why, war can't cease. 
If you nah look like me, me a go pop my piece. 
And that's the reason why, we can't get along. 
If you nuh do it my way then your doing it wrong. 
And that's the reason why Iraqi babies gonna cry. 
And more Palestinians and Israelis gonna die. 
That's the reason why the world is in pain 
We say we want peace if reign but ah bullets again. 

Bridge: [Repeat 5x]

Now tell me why can't you accept me as I am' 
Just the way I am now .

Tanya Stephens,"Well, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride
I'd get past my pride, you'd be by my side
I wouldn't be holding on to memories
I wouldn't need them, you'd be here with me
That I was separate and complete, was my confusion
My reciprocity turned out to be retribution
So caught up with what I wanted you to be
Convinced that perfection meant spot free

Bwoy, look at me now
A shadow of my former glory 
And the moral of my story is....

(Hook)
It may seem I'm holding it down 
But if you wanna know the truth
I'm slowly losing my ground, 
If you wanna know the truth
There's no one keeping me warm
If you wanna know the truth
I'm only good in your arms
If you wanna know the truth

I miss the way you used to say I wanna bone ya
But I have to resist the urge to phone ya
You must have moved on it's been over a year 
And it wouldn't be fair to burden you with my tears
I know I said I didn't need you and I'd be alright, 
But I got a much different story tonight
I miss your laughter such a beautiful thing
Now the silence closes in

Oh oh aye
Just look at me now
A shadow of my former glory and the moral of my story is...

(hook)

Oh oh, keep wishing

Just look at me now
A shadow of my former glory
And the moral of my story is..

Tanya Tucker,"In a broken down apartment house
Lay a woman in labor
She said by the grace of God I'll have this child
And the help of a neighbor
At six o'clock the sun was rising
On upon the world
At seven forty five
The neighbor smiled and sayed
You've got a beautiful baby girl

She named her Spring
Winter's been a long time passin
She named her Spring
And though she's never been wed
She held her newborn child and said
Spring, I've waited a long, long time for you

In a broked down apartment house
Lay a woman dying
And by her side a little six year old girl
Who was softly crying
Momma don't go away 
And leave me all alone
Momma said to the welfare lady
Find my child a good home

I'll miss my Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
I'll miss you Spring
The angels carried her away
The welfare lady knelt to pray
Spring, she'll be a long time gone from you 

In a beautiful church out side of town
Stands a woman smiling
On her hand is a wedding band 
Of fashionable stylin
All the years in the orphan's home
He shared with you 
And now you hopes and childhood dreams
Have all come true

He loves his Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
He loves you Spring
He promised you today 
He'll never ever go away 
Spring, he's waited a long, long time for you
A long, long time for you",Spring

Tanya Tucker,"You came riding in on the sunrise
On a hot west Texas day
With a fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water
Well water is my game
And for the small price of $100.00
I bet you I could make it rain

Step back non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone start that fire burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

They all just stood there staring
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzy Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat
She said you call yourself the Rainman
Well you ought to be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

Step back non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

Hey Lizzy
Well a man's gotta have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between
Oh come with me Lizzy
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you
Look yonder there comes the rain

Step back non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire burning
Somebody beat the drum",Lizzie and the Rain Man
Tanya Tucker,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

[Chorus]",Angel from Montgomery
Tanya Tucker,"Well since my baby left me
Well I found a new place to dwell
Well it's down at the end of Lonely Street
That Heartbreak Hotel, where I'll be

I'll be just so lonely baby, 
Well I'm so lonely,
I'll be so lonely I could die.

Well they're so lonely they could die.

You've got a tale to tell. 
Well just take a walk down Lonely Street

Where I was goin' and how far
Like the river as she flows

Your heart still sings a wanderin' tune
Like the wind cannot be bound, oh
Walls would only tie you down

In the same directions
But parted before the journey's end

I stayed within my boundaries

You brought me to the edge of love and now I'm fallin' in

I'm going down, down, down, spinning round, round, round
Falling deeper in love every day
I've tried so hard to take it slow but I'm losing control

Then you looked right into my eyes and a voice that could make the devil cry
You just sang my poor heart away
Friends may come and friends may go but lovers either stay
Or break your heart oh you just fall apart
I thought I could take it or leave it but I can't hardly believe it
But nobody ever sang a song about me before
And I begged you baby as you walked out the door
Please don't play my song for somebody else
It's so beautiful let me keep it for myself
Please don't change the chorus and put in another man's name
Please don't take my song away oh baby please don't take my song away

I heard a voice that made me shiver

Is it the hand of fate or maybe somebody tryin' to tell you something

We cried clinging to each other tenderly we were the best that we could be
Through the sweet and gentle years and now after all these tears we cried
Love knows we tried
Love knows we tried we gave it all we had and more
Love knows we tried we've got the memory and someday we may see
Goodbye doesn't mean we really didn't try so you can hold your head up high

He was burnin' rubber, halfway to Waco
Destination- liquor store
And though he'd never robbed one before
He made up his mind to do it
Then he'd lay low.

Cause all he thought he needed was a little bit of cash to roll on
A good set of wheels and some gas to get him there
But all he really needed was something real to hold on to
All he really needed was somebody to care.

The edge of town was just in sight,
There she stood in his lights
With a sign in her hand that just read ""San Antone""
He hit his brakes and he stopped that car
Said I hadn't planned to go that far
But I'll give you a lift to the far side of Waco.

Tell me is it so

I knew not where to go
Surrounded by the emptiness
Of a love that left me cold
I stumbled through that darkness
Of nights that have no stars

And days that have no sunshine
To warm my naked heart
Like a bird in flight brought down by stones
From an unknown assailant's sling
A stranger took you from my arms
And I lost everything, In days to come I nearly ran

Out of ways to stay alive
But through it all I never lost
The will to survive
(And)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live
And you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes, I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you

Like a thief who takes just what he needs
And leaves the rest behind
You took the heart right out of me
And left me with my mind

And I've almost went out of it
At times believed I did
But gradually I learned you're someone
I'll have to live with
('Cause)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be

And you won't be the death of me, oh no

He remembers the fall that he took last September
He's hopin' he draws that ol' burr again
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
A dream chasing cowboy with a rode girl by his side

Lately he's talking about having a son
Someone who'll learn from the things that he's done
A young bronc bustin' a-buckaroo

A trailer behind an old white Eldorado
A red western sunset and a blue mountain range
Some things in this life he'd like to do over
But livin' with him is something I'd never change

Now that we're fallen apart.
How can we talk to heart to heart you're so far away what can I say.
I've tried to under-stand but things got so out of hand 
Held out as long as I can Now I'm on the telephone saying.

Can I see you tonight 
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right 
It could be love if we make it.

Now that we're on the line 
I'll tell you what's on my mind
The love we're trying to hide. 
Well, it's suffering from to much pride.
When will we see the end to this game where nobody wins
For as long as nobody gives in It will go on and on and on.

I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow and let the good times roll

But I can make time stand still
I can turn it back and make things just the same

You're far away but always near, I can see your face
And hear you call my name , freeze frame

Tanya Tucker,"Looking back she thinks about that moment in the sand 
And what was just a summer fling
Got so far out of hand
She knew that he was taken
But she gave in anyway
She believed it when she heard him say...

Soon I'll be free to be with you
Soon I'll be telling you know who the facts of life
I want you to be my wife and our dreams will all come true
Soon

Christmas finds her all along with no calls to rejoice
So she calls his caller phone just to hear his voice
She knows that it's useless, but she does it anyway
And she knows how to answer before she hears him say...

Soon, I can't talk to you right now
Soon, you'll hear a beep and you know how to play this game
Leave your number and your name, and I promise I'll call back
Soon

Someday slowly turns to never
Tears and champagne offer no solution

He'll say soon to her forever
So she makes her new years resolution
Soon she won't call him anymore
Soon, when he shows up at her door and 
Ask's her when can I be with you again
It'll be her turn to say
Soon",Soon

Tanya Tucker,"They married back in forty-two
They were young and love was new
And every day that feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad
The hope would chase away the sad
And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

The fifties came and the sixties went
A mortgage note replaced the rent
And they made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them
The children all turned out just fine
He retired in sixty-nine
Left with oh so little time
Between the two of them

Today I braved the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names
Now that's the most that ever came
Between the two of them
Oh I miss them both so much

And the pleasure of just growing up

She wouldn't know me if she saw me
And you'd turn your head if you did
She'll never know how much you loved me
Or what kind of love we had
Or what kind of love we had

You threw away all our pictures
But the memories won't go away
She's asking questions that you don't have to answer
It's written all over your face, yes
It's written all over your face

I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she sees it in your eyes
What's in your heart you can not hide
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind

Late in the midnight hour
When you're doing what lovers do
There's still a desire deep down inside
That's just between me and you, yea
It's just between me and you

Now don't you ever feel guilty
Giving just half of your heart
Holdin' on to your foolish pride
Is just keeping us apart.
Yea, it's just keeping us apart

In the cool of the night
When the howling wind calls my name
You can run to her arms
But it's not the same
It's just not the same

Halfway runnin' to keep up

Why would she leave us both this way?""

And half our hearts were in doubt
And half the time while walking the line
I ended up steppin' out

Half my prayers were praying to God
And half my prayers were to you

I swear my heart might crack in two

And, baby, you'll recall the one who said these words to you:

I'll come back as another woman,
One with all the secrets to your heart.
I'll come back as another woman,
I'll be the one you burn for,
That you reach for in the dark.
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart. 

You'll hear the echo of my promise, (Ha, Ha, Ha.)
How you laughed and how I cried.
The one you finally give your heart to, (Ha, Ha, Ha.)
Will leave you crying in the night.

I'll come back as another woman,
One with all the secrets to your heart.
I'll come back as another woman,
I'll be the one you burn for,
That you reach for in the dark.
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart.

Tanya Tucker,"Mama said,
""Tell me what's wrong child,
You didn't eat enough
To keep a bird alive,
And you haven't said
Two words to me all evening.""

She said,
""Girl, you've got your long face on,
Your eyes are red,
And your smile is gone.""
So I broke down,
And I told my mama the reason.

I'm in love and he's in Dallas.
I'm as blue as a girl can be.
Is he down there thinkin' about my love,
Or driftin' away from me?
I'm in love and he's in Dallas
But that's not the way it's s'pposed to be.
Can a promise reach from Texas
All the way to Tennesee?

I really shoulda heard
From him by now,
He promised he'd write
When things settled down.
And send me money
For a ticket when things got better.

And mama I guess
He's just workin' hard
And you know how
Those cowboys are.
But it's been three weeks
And I ain't got a letter.

Tanya Tucker,"I know a man, a good friend of mine;
He spends all his time tryin' to make love work out right.
But the woman he loves, she don't feel the same, no;
I don't know much about love but at least I learned one thing:

If it don't come easy, you better let it go.
'Cause when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow.
Don't make it hard on your heart, you might be better off alone,
If it don't come easy, you better let it go, yeah.

I know a woman, she's got a heart of gold.
You know she'd do anything to make her man feel right at home.

When our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through
You can love me again.
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me

But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each other's inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

I know you like the night life, the parties and the fun.
You like to hang around until the last song has been sung.

My arms stay open all night, from sundown 'til the morning light,

Not a soul insight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm moving in
He's headin' back from somewhere
That he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin'
In a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown
Askin' for miracle
Hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather
That's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls

And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

She's waitin' by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls

And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

To the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol
Kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror
He won't do this again
Cause tonight will be the last time
She'll wonder where he's been",Thunder Rolls

And offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell

So the county had to claim
Inside the old mans ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter

Imagine my surprise
When You Told Me It Was Over
Threw your coat over your shoulder
And walked out of my life
You said that it was just infatuation
Something I'd get over soon enough

But it hurts like love
And it feels like heartache
You were here in my arms
 
Then you were gone
And now it's just too late
It's a crying shame
After all of this pain
I'm still not sure just what it was
But it hurts like love

I don't know how it happened
I gave it all my passion
Believing it was real
I was sure that it could save you
But all it ever gave you
Was this emptiness I feel
I know that it's only an illusion
But every night that I don't feel your touch

Too many rooms with nothing to fill
You can't furnish me, with the little things

Hold me while I dream

Is to tell me that you love me, little things

A young man came to Memphis
Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom 
In his world
People never took the time 
to mind the young man's questions
Until one day they heard him ask 
a little green eyed girl

Does she ever talk about
A place called New Orleans
Has she ever mentioned

Lost a month of life and labor 
To the county jail
Just because he asked a little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell

They found a faded letter

Tanya Tucker,"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her ""baby""
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks around town with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky",Delta Dawn [DVD][Live]

Feel like I'm running real low on willpower

From the break of dawn till the midnight hour
I keep fighting to let you go
But your love is beyond my control

Took down that picture of you and me
But every time I look up where it used to be
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

Still got your number next to the phone
Just when I believe, I can leave it alone

Tanya Tucker,"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love,
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter",Coal Miner's Daughter

And you'll say hey Loretta I love you more than my Irish Setter
Hey Loretta don't leave me alone
Hey Loretta I swear I'm a gonna treat you better
Buy you brand new overalls if you'll only come back home

I work my fingers to the bone and we don't hardly speak
And all I ever get is just a little kiss about once a week
So you can feed the chickens and you can milk the cow
This a woman's liberation honey is a gonna start right now
And you'll say hey Loretta...

I'll dress up like a movie star and pretty up my hair
And no one here is a gonna know what I'll be doing there
I'll be swinging from a chandelier and bouncin' off the walls
Instead of lovin' just one man I'm a gonna love 'em all
And you'll say hey Loretta...

Ja paistaa vanha kunnon kuu.
Se onkin onni, että saan
Taas maalla kuuta tuijottaa ja rakastaa.

Mä muistan tytön tuon hyvin niin,
Ja muistan miten me suudeltiin.
Kun mä stadia kohti pyörällä sotkin,
Niin sitä erottiin.
Hän jäi luokse joenrannan,
Missä tuoksuu havupuu.
Kotiin sieltä hänet kannan,
Pussaan puhki koko suun.

Tiedän kyllä minkälaisen.

I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",O Sole Mio/It's Now or Never

Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy

Take back your singing in the rain

Is that I don't belong to you

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place

For the boys on MTV

Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I took the knife as well

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

You said that I wont have to worry

She wonders if she can go on

Another dying Sunday
She hopes to hide these things behind a darkened veil
She dies inside thinking of every time she failed

Foreshadowing a pale tomorrow

Maybe she can go on

To find the scary freezing holy carpet at your feet

An empty wallet shows a picture that you've never seen

I had a dream I could fly
I felt the cold on my skin
Then I opened my eyes

So I jumped out of bed
Went down the fire escape
Now I'm laid out on the street
I wasn't running away

From something I could control
It was inside of me
I didn't know where to go
But I decided to leave

I still remember that night
I've never been the same
Still wonder if I can fly
Was it just a dream?

I wasn't happy for so long
So many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

But now, it's too late to say I'm sorry
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around

One night when I couldn't sleep
I heard a knock at the door
She put her hand on me slow
Then she opened my heart

I asked myself is this real?
I've never felt this way
She said I need to escape
I said I know a place

So she laid down on my bed
I said confide in me
She looked deep into my eyes
And she invited me

She must lived for her sleep
She never said goodbye
Her angels took her away
I guess now she can fly

I wasn't happy for so long
So many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

But now, it's too late to say I'm sorry

Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around

I think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face

I dream about magnolias in bloom

Tara MacLean,"There's a fire on the mountain
A path through the sea
You were blinded by the flames in me
There's a broken land I've seen it
Here to swallow love
I can feel my fingers slipping
Maybe I don't know what love is
But it isn't this,
No, it isn't this
There's a truth long forgotten
A trust long denied
And a child somewhere hungry and crying
And maybe I don't know what love is
But it isn't this,
No, it isn't this
There's a path through the mountain
Fire on the sea
You were blinded by the flames in me",Blinded
Tara MacLean,"Check your weapons at the door
You don't live here anyore
For a heart cannot repent
When it doesn't know it's spent

It's lifetime beating itself to death
There you are as still as stone
Stretching skin over bone
Well they say I've lost my will

But I'm just standing still
In a world that swallows cowards
For the crime of killing time
I'll be checking out the scenery

From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden
Always changing always still
Still breathing

There you are in my mind
Pale from living underground
Divided and divided
Until no one can be found

Nothing left to break down
I'll be checking out the scenery 
From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden

Always changing always still
Still breathing",Divided
Tara MacLean,"Looks like something's coming
Looks like there's gonna be a storm
Looks like everyone's running
Looks like everyone is torn

Hands to blades
As daylight fades
Hold this shaking hand

Swimming from dry land
Swimming from dry land

Looks like everyone's broken
Looks like everyone's lost
Look at all the money we're making

We don't even see what it's cost
Hands to guns
As night time comes
Hold this shaking hand

Swimming from dry land
Swimming from dry land
Looks like war in the valley
Looks like war in the sky
Looks like war on the playground

Tara MacLean,"If I could spend my life in awe
Of everything I ever saw
You'd be the one to lift me up

If the sky came crashing down
You'd be the only star I found
Of all those scattered on the ground
I'd hold you in my hand

From now until eternity

It took so long to get here
Now I'm saying things I swore I'd never say
And I'm afraid again
I thought I had it in me
I used to be so sure
There I was stronger than ever
And here I am blaming the hurt
And if I fall, 
I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again
Sweet little fighter
Sweet little scar
Sweet little fire
In my heart
It seems so easy now
Everything I dreamed about when I was a child
It looks like a good thing's here
And I think I'll stay for a while
And if I fall, I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again
You came in screaming
And never stopped to listen to your one and only prayer
A place for you somewhere
Sweet little fighter
Sweet little scar
Sweet little fire

And if I fall, 
I will find a way back to my hands

Jericho loved the music and fell
Into your arms breathless
Heard a sound

Shut my eyes so tight
Heard the whisper of a storm coming
Oh, funny how
I spent this time waiting around

It's a lie
Everything you felt until now
Saw her dancing
The floor gave way

Opened its mouth
To say her name
Saw her falling
Cast away, cast away

She learned to fly one day
Oh, funny how
I spent this time on the ground
It's a lie

Everything you felt until now
Same place I've always been
I'm just lost on these roads again

Lying by the side of the road
Waiting for a good Samaritan
But no one has the time to ask,
Why are you bleeding?
And are you going far?
All the rest has left
This burden on my chest
Can you see the air is angry
Collapsing into nothing
For the soul has risen
But never has forgiven
So we stay and starve the heart to make a living
Have you seen the hungry ones
Digging in the sand
Once a sleeping passenger
Awoke into this tired land
Last chance to find out where I am

If you would reach for me
If you would reach for me it could be

Something real
When your faith has left before the morning
Someone there softly breathing
A body to awaken

They go so far sometimes
Do I blame the wind

Closing shutters and finding flash lights

Some sank into the milky way

To the stable on Christmas Day

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence (Strumentale)

I know the situation that you're thinking
And you were skeptical
Of giving up your loving to me
Under the circumstance
Boy, we took a chance
I never knew good good loving would be
We made our messes
Now you're gone away
And I live everyday

Summer nights
Doing it right, babe
You just don't know how bad
Oh, boy I want you back
Doing the things that me and you used to do

We made our messes
Now you're gone away
And I live everyday
For the day
Just to see you again
I just wait to see my distant lover

So many miles away
Oh yeah I want him close to me

You know what I'm trying to say
(Waiting all night, waiting all day)
I'm keeping thoughts of you
That I can't erase
(Until I see you again)
Say a prayer for me please
(Until I see you again)
And in the meantime keep thinking of me",Distant Lover
Tarancón,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a la Vida

Taranda Greene,"I never said that I would give you silver or gold
Or that you would never feel the fire or shiver in the cold
But I did say you'd never walk through this world alone
(Hmm)
And I did say, don't make this world your home

I never said that fear wouldn't find you in the night
Or that loneliness was something you'd never have to fight
But I did say I'd be right there by your side
And I did say I'll always help you fight

'Cause you know I made a promise that I intend to keep
My grace will be sufficient in every time of need
And my love will be the anchor that you can hold onto
This is the promise, this is the promise I made to you

I never said that friends would never turn their backs on you
Or that the world around you wouldn't see you as a fool
But I did say like me you'll surely be despised
And I did say my ways confound the wise

I didn't say you'd never taste the bitter kiss of death
Or have to walk through chilly Jordan to enter into rest
But I did say I'd be waiting right on the other side
(Yeah, yeah)
And I did say I'll dry every tear you cry

'Cause you know I made a promise that I've prepared a place
And some day sooner than you think you'll see me face to face
And you'll sing with the angels and a countless multitude
This is the promise, this is the promise I've made to you

So just keep on walkin', don't turn to the left or right
And in the midst of darkness, let this be your light
That hell can't separate us and you're gonna make it through
This is the promise, this is the promise I made to you",Promise

Wake up, wake up, there's an angel in the snow
Look up, look up, it's a frightened dead boy
With so much hate, such bad dreams
He could have seen the toy's the key
But no one saw, no one saw

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Ne vakit gelsin aklima
Durdururum zamani
Gidersen dogmaz günesim
Sarar gözlerimi aci bir telas
Gitme desem canim kalir misin benimle?
Gitme desem canim sever misin beni yine?
Gitme,gitme,gitme ah gitme
Gitme,gitme,gitme ah gitme",Gitme

Tarkan,"Seninle son gecemiz bu
Bu son sevişmemiz belki de
Bırak alev alsın bedenin
Hissettiğin gibi ol, bu gece, bu gece

Tüm oyunları oynayalım sırayla
Günaha bulanalım biteviye
Sşş konuşma hic soru sorma
Sırlarımı keşfet bu gece, bu gece

Kır zincirlerini gel
Aşka kanalım seninle
Yum gözlerini
Soluksuz ucalım göklerde

Geriye sayım başladı
Ayrılık anı cok yakın
Bırak tutuşsun bedenin
Tadına varalım her dakikanın
Tüm yasakları delelim

Tarkan,"Dag, tepe, toprak ask kokuyor
Savuluna dostlar yar geliyor
Bu eda bu naz bir ömre bedel
Isvesi, cilvesi çildirtiyor

Bikmadim, yilmadim
Pesindeyim yine yorulmadim
Tutunamadim gülüm sana doyamadim
Ömrümü adadim yaranamadim

Bir saga, bir sola hop oynarim
Ugruna kul köle olurum
Pervaneyim sana divaneyim ama,
Basina bela olurum

Bir hos oldum bana bir haller oluyor
Sarhos oldum bedenim sarsiliyor
Bu eda bu naz bir ömre bedel
Isvesi, cilvesi çildirtiyor.",Basina Bela Olurum
Tarkan,"Gözlerinden okunuyor
Beni seviyorsun
Sözlerin seni ele veriyor
Sen de istiyorsun
Eninde sonunda benim olacaksin
Hadi naz yapma
Sevgiyi, aski bende bulacaksin
Yabana atma
Biktirma, usandirma
Yeter beni kizdirma
Gel artik kollarima
Gül döktüm yollarina
Gel gündüzle gece olalalim
Gel gökyüzünde yildiz olalim
Seninle mutlu yarinlara kosalim
Gel beraber mesut olalim
Geçmiyor ki sensiz geceler
Rüyalar yetmiyor
Isyan ediyor içimde sevgiler
Sabrim tükeniyor",Gül Döktüm Yollarina
