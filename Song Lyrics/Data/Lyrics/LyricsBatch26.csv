Coleman Hawkins,"I'll get by
As long as I have you
Though there be rain
And darkness too
I'll not complain
I'll see it through

Poverty
May come to me, it's true
But what care I
Say, I'll get by
As long as I have you.

But what care I
Say, I'll get by
As long as I have you.",I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)
Coleman Hawkins,"You must take the ""A"" train
To go to Sugar Hill way up in Harlem
If you miss the ""A"" train
You`ll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem
Hurry, get on, now it`s coming
Listen to those rails a-thrumming
All aboard, get on the ""A"" train
Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem","Take the ""A"" Train"
Coleman Hawkins,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Coleman Hawkins,"I'd wait for you
I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move
The earth for you
To prove my love, dear
And its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd sigh for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die tor you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along",Until the Real Thing Comes Along
Coleman Hawkins,"I'm just a gigolo and ev'rywhere I go
People know the bar I'm playing
Pay for every dance selling each romance
Ooh, I could say

There would come a day
When news will pass away
What could they say about me

When the end comes I know
There were just the gigolos
Right, 'cause I'm without me

I'm just a gigolo everywhere I go
People know the part it's playing
Pay for every dance selling each romance
Ooh, I could say

There would come a day
When news will pass away
What could they say about me

When the end comes I know
There were just the gigolos
Right, 'cause I'm without me

'Cause I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody
Nobody cares for me

I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come
And take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad

Sad and lonesome all of the time
Even on the beat, on the, on the beat
I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody, nobody

I, I, I, ain't got nobody
Nobody, nobody cares for me
Nobody, nobody

I'm so sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come
And take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad

Really want that soul
Little loving soul all of the time
Even on the beat, cherry, cherry on the beat
Need a long tall darling, mama

Feeling sick, got nobody
No, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no one, no one
Loopey loop, darling, darling

Getting serious, got to see the walls
Over there, nobody, got no one, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody cares for me",Just a Gigolo
Coleman Hawkins,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Coleman Hawkins,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Coleman Hawkins,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I really think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby I'm oh so right.",I May Be Wrong
Coleman Hawkins,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Coleman Hawkins,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy
Coleman Hawkins,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Coleman Hawkins,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind

Coleman Hawkins,"I'm looking over a four-leaf clover
I overlooked before
One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain
Third is the roses that grow in the lane

No need explaining, the one remaining
Is somebody I adore
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover
I overlooked before

I'm looking over a four-leaf clover

Coleman Hawkins,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Coleman Hawkins,"In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company

Everything's OK
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong

In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give

Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone

In a mellow tone

In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone

Coleman Hawkins,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Coleman Hawkins,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Coleman Hawkins,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Coleman Hawkins,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)
Coleman Hawkins,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
",Street of Dreams
Coleman Hawkins,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May

And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
",Sweet and Lovely
Coleman Hawkins,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Coleman Hawkins,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,

Coleman Hawkins,"Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss
No! No! No!
But when two eager lips are pressed against yours
You'll know, yes, you'll know

Can anyone explain the glow of romance
No! No! No!
But when you hear the phrase ""It's you I adore""
You'll know, yes, you'll know

And you will find, to give love a start
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart

Can anyone explain the wonder of love 
No! No! No!
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh
We know, yes, we know

And you will find, to give love a start

Coleman Hawkins,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea

If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

Coleman Hawkins,"Savoy--the home of sweet romance
Savoy--it wins you with a glance

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

Coleman Hawkins,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory

When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Coleman Hawkins,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Coleman Hawkins,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Coleman Hawkins,"I'm up in the world,
but I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

Coleman Hawkins,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Coleman Hawkins,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

Almost completely divine

Your lips may be near,

that you've a heart that never melts.

where is your heart?

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man

And perhaps a kid or two

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

But I like your attitude

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

Coleman Hawkins,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Coleman Hawkins," I talk to the trees
 But they don't listen to me
 I talk to the stars
 But they never hear me
 The breeze hasn't time
 To stop and hear what I say
 I talk to them all in vain
 
 [Chorus:]
 But suddenly my words
 Reach someone else's ears
 Touch someone else's heartstrings, too
 I tell you my dreams
 And while you're listening to me
 I suddenly see them come true
 
 I can see us on an April night
 Sipping brandy underneath the stars
 Reading poems in the candlelight
 To the strumming of guitars
 
 I will tell you all the books I've read
 And the way I met the King of France
 Then I'll send the servants off to bed
 And I'll ask you for a dance

My true love was true
Oh, I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed

To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

When a lovely flame dies

The leaves are lullabying
Violins are all around you

Of sounding brass

I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

Every night I am longing to
Hold you close to my eager breast

Wanting love, in that heaven I'm dreaming of
Makes that heaven seem far above

Dreams are vain, but I cling to the
Merest chance that you may hear me

Stop, drop, clap, clap, low, then bring it back
Stop, drop, clap, clap,

Colette Carr,"Got me wrapped up in a zig zag,
Got me thrown back like who the hella is that?
Nick-nack-paddy-wack give a dog a bone back,
Break me off a piece of the kit-kat cognac,
Brushing on my lipstick, hit me with the throwback,
Small white and fresh chew me up like a tic-tac
Hit me with the clip to the click to the clack
Everything passed in a flash of the Kodak
So run running man run as fast as you can
Hit me with the numb with the jack to the chan,
Gotta put it down like a bad hand with the Mac 10 like a backhand,
Remember back when you would chase me down like a PacMan
Upside down in the world in a handstand,
Now I see your lies in the eyes of a cat-scan, how can I be Robin if you can't be my Batman?

I feel the pressures on me,
I'll be your precious army,
I really need you to know.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
Never take away my heart, take away take take away my heart.

With an M16 and a Glock to the face though,
Blew me away spent cheap like a peso
Stole my mind leave me like a bagel,
Hole in my head now I'm stuck as a Leggo.
Said I'm your center but you were my staple
So far gone in a bind and a tangle,
Going down south now I'm tripping San Diego,
Stuck at the boarder in a hot Winnebago.
O but it's so cliché,
Ace high went to waist with your poor play,
Could've had a diamond but you lost me in a poor raise,
Poor taste now a closed case.
Pop like a PPK, semi automatic,
CC sprays, Hot villa Tiki Bay,
Gotta get away alleviate.

I feel the pressures on me,
I'll be your precious army,
I really need you to know.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
Never take away my heart, take away take take away my heart.

Every little feeling that I stacked in a rack,
Every little plan got lost so I ran,
Cold war status C.O.D.,
Got me all surrounded V.I.P.
With your love gone I'm stung as a needle
Clean as a whistle colt desert eagle,
Couldn't see the day when you said it was over
Chalked me out like the white cliffs of Dover.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
Never take away my heart, take away take take away my heart.

Take away take take away my heart.
Take away take take away my heart.",F16

Hearing it play all the way through,
'Cause you never pick up when I'm in this mood and,
You knew, I knew, we're doomed,

Then you walk past like you don't know me,
Call back when you get lonely,
That's what we always do,
You only pull me in when I try and get rid of you.

Headed straight back to the same zone
Sick of that song that I hate on your ring tone,
Hearing it play all the way through,
'Cause you never pick up when I'm in this mood and,
You knew, I knew, we're doomed,
But not through, no matter how hard we,
Try to it's never gonna happen is it?

You hang up, I call back, I think that it's never gonna happen
I give up, you call back, we're on tracks and never gonna happen
You hang up, I call back, I think that it's never gonna happen
I give up, you call back, we're on tracks and never gonna happen

Colette Magny,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Colette Renard,"Y’avait un’ fois une rose
Une rose et un marin
L’marin était à Formose
La rose était à Dublin

Jamais au monde ils n’se virent
Ils étaient beaucoup trop loin
Lui quittait pas son navire
Ell’  quittait pas son jardin 

Au d’ssus de la rose sage
Des oiseaux passaient tout l’temps
Et puis aussi des nuages 
Des soleils et des printemps

Au d’ssus du marin volage
Des rêv’s étaient tout pareils
Aux printemps et aux nuages
Aux oiseaux et aux soleils

L’marin périt en septembre
Et la ros’, le même jour
Vient se flétrir dans la chambre 
D’une fille en mal d’amour

Personn’ jamais ne suppose
Qu’il y ait le moindre lien
Entre l’marin de la Formose
Et la rose de Dublin

Et seul un doigt sur la bouche
Un ang’ beau comme un éclair
Jett’ quand le soleil se couche 
Des pétales sur la mer",Le Marin et La Rose
Colette Renard,"Quand je suis devenue belle,
Quand j'ai pris mes seize ans,
Je suis restée demoiselle,

Z'avaient de bonnes têtes,
Ou z'étaient bons garçons,
M'emmenaient à la fête,
Me chantaient des chansons...

Zon... Zon... Zon... froissé mon corsage
Et toutes ces choses qui ne servent à rien
Zon... Zon... Zon... puisque c'est l'usage,
Voulu toujours aller plus loin.

De la porte à la chambre
Et du fauteuil au lit,
M'ont fait croire en décembre
Au mois de... Mai Joli
Mais au petit matin blême,
Fallait se rhabiller,
Y avait plus de «je t'aime»
Et même plus d'amitié...

Zon... Zon... Zon... cueilli tant de roses
Que le jardin s'est défleuri.
Zon... Zon... Zon... rien vu de la chose,
Z'avaient l'œil sur le paradis.

J'ai laissé ma jeunesse
Au bal des quatre vents
Et me voilà la princesse
D'un drôle de bois dormant.
Chez Marie ça s'appelle,
Mais y a pas de plaque au seuil,
C'est la maison des belles.

Colin Blunstone,"Sometimes when I wake at night
In the hour before the light
Darkness seems to cover
And hide me from all reason
Then out on the rooftop high
Another day begins to climb
Something is waking in the light
There I can see
A sleepy head so close to me
And every little word we sang through the night
Is bright for the day

Hey, you know you are love to me
You hold everything like a child for me
And I think of you and your funny ways
That sweet summer smile on your lovely face
For I love you
You are love to me

I try when we have to fight
To say the words
To put things right
It gets so hard not touching
With miles between our fingers
And then when you don't believe
There's so much pride to hide beneath
That something is growing
In every room the touch of you
The tender edge of loving you
And everything I have is nothing
If it can't belong to you

Hey, you know you are love to me

When I looked in the mirror on my bedroom door
It wasn't the way that you looked at your sister
Just then I noticed he'd started to kiss her
Well I may have been slow to accept all he said
Soon felt myself turn from milk white to red

With nothing but my morning 
And a quiet telephone
But that's not what's killing me
'Cause I don't mind being alone
I feel like I just lost
A part of my home",Do Magnolia Do
Colin Blunstone,"You - you've got that lovelight in your eyes
The moment we re-met
I knew that I'd forget my sorrow oo-oo-you
You've got that lovelight in your eyes
I'm hoping you'll say, you wanna stay
Till tomorrow ow-ow-ow

Seems so long ago since I first met you
I've waited for you patiently
Though there's a gypsy in your heart
I knew from the start
You'd always come back home to me
Oh and it's true
Oh baby, it's true oo-oo-you

You've got that lovelight in your eyes
It's no good denying
Not even trying it's true oo-oo-you
Yoy've got that lovelight in your eyes
There's no use pretending
You're just defending your virtue oo-oo

Don't think it's strange
The way we've changed
And yet here we are together again
And there's something
In the way you look today
That makes me love you just the same
Oh and it's true
Oh baby it's true oo-oo-you

You - you've got that lovelight in your eyes
It's no illusion, a foregone conclusion
It's true oo-oo-you
You've got that lovelight in your eyes
There's no more to say
When you look this way
Oh it's true

Colin Blunstone,"I've tried to forget you
But I just can't help myself
I should have never let you leave
Without me
I realize I was a fool to you
Send me a letter, show me a sign
I'm saving my loving for you

I have a photograph of you
A memory or two, my love
Lasting forever
I have a photograph of you
And though you are so far away
I'll never forget you - my love

If I could tell you
I'm sure I could justify
The words that I said to you
As we said goodbye
If I could just apologize to you
Could you forgive me
I need you here with me
I want to make you realize

I have a photograph of you
A memory or two, my love

While we were both in love
We didn't know
But fate brought us here today
Why run away
Let's pretend we're going to stay
Though we both know
It's touch and go

It's not too late for us to start again
And in your heart I know you feel the same
Don't always live in the past
You know it never lasts
Time is catching up so fast
And we both know
It's touch and go

Something to warm me on a lonely Winter's night 
And if I want to think someone's thinking of me 
I look into my song, see who I can see 
My pace is curlin', hurlin' now, from key to key 
Written through the gloom 
Of a lonely empty room 
All the lines start to unlock my mind and I feel free 
The Winter's night gives way to a warm Summer's day, yeah, yeah 
The light's turned off, but there's no woman to turn on 
And there's no happiness in having to undress

We had all the magic to put us on our way
And all the tragedy that we ever want to see

When I say the best is yet to come

Where did we go wrong
Was it so enlightening we couldn't find our way
Was it all so frightening we really couldn't see which move to make
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

And if you leave me now
Like you say you might
Oh please don't leave me now
'cause I know if you do none of this will come true...so

Where do we go now

It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you, I don't want you to

Breakaway, fly across your ocean
Breakaway, the time has come for you
Breakaway, fly across your ocean
Breakaway, the time has come

And now you travel on your own opinion
Leave your fears and doubts to fade away
Dust your dreams and take them on your journey
Spread your wings and fly away

I have been misled
Out in stormy seas

And in my search for freedom
I have found someone to lean on
This is not someone who's here and gone
This is everlasting love

I have been rescued
My life has just begun
For one who is so weak
With you I feel so strong

I can't believe my eyes

At last I understand
This peace inside of me

And in my search for purity
I have found someone who has met my needs

Charlie Mingus on a rainy night
Row the boat fisherman
One more time, one more time

Hey! It's all over now
Find a streetlamp and take a bow
Dance with a stranger, love has no fences now

And the gun's not loaded
If you want to talk it out
But I'm through explaining what this life's all about

Chorus
I want to say a prayer
Is anybody listening, anybody there
I want to say a prayer
Is anybody there

Unborn babies and sidewalk machines
Love me in your dreams
One more time, one more time

And I'm standing right here
If you want to dance
So hold on baby 'cause this might be my last chance

I kneel at the altar of love's tenderness
I'm waiting in the doorway for angels to care
I'm fixing the roof but
The rain's coming in
And I can't find the words
Or the courage
To ask where you've been

Would it be so bad
Why should it change
All that we had

Hurt you once before

How could he do it yo you
How could he stand to see you sad
Why does he treat a love so bad

If I say don't see him
Would it be so wrong
What does it take
To see him gone

If only you could be
Strong enough to see
That he doesn't matter to you
You should be making other plans
So I feel I have to say
Don't go and throw you life away

He takes, you give
He leaves you lonely
He makes it hard to listen to me

Is help me to work this through
In the end
I could never ask for more

If it's not worth fighting for

You mean so much more to me than words could ever say
So I will show in everything I do my love is here to stay
And if I had to take my final breath
To prove to you my love is true
I would, with no regrets

The sun set on the left
The rounded mountains pointed
To the black clouds in the West 

Hey, there's a darkness
In the sky that's not the night
Hey, there's a rain cloud there
That's shutting out the light 

(Chorus:)
What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

As soon as we reached Barcelona
The cold wind touched the beach
The sun we left in London
Is away beyond our reach 

Hey, I said darling:
It seems a waste of time
Hey, all I do is sit 
And drink our Spanish wine 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

Of all the tales of Granada 
They tell of Islam's run
They lived beneath the Moorish lord
Beneath a Moorish sun

Oh, how we yearned to turn 
Our faces to that glare
When down from the mountains
Came the rain to soak our hair

When you run for the sun, you catch the rain

Can't tell no lie
There's something going on
Standing in the front line
No alibi
Bang in the danger zone

No longer should we hesitate
For we could leave it much too late
It's time that we decided our fate
We can't read those signs much longer

We should step right out of here
Trade our love, no time, no tear
Pack our bags and disappear
We should quit that danger zone 

We could find some better place
Start again with no disgrace
Before we sink without a trace
We should quit that danger zone forever

No place to hide
Out there on your own
When you've tried everything you know
Unsatisfied

Colin Blunstone,"Last night she called across the 
Northern seas from home
And told me about the morning that was breaking
And the love she kept inside
The California sun may have me on the run, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I've flown the world and watched
The sunset down in old Jamaica
I've crossed the mountains and the desserts
Where the western heroes sung
And I'll be back someday
As soon as I can get away
Those memories will never fade away, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I wanna be back home again
In the land where I belong
I wanna see my love again soon
Sitting in the evening sun

These days I won't ever regret
I've been so happy here, and yet
There is one thing I can't forget
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies

Won't you take me back

Almost everything my friend

Like falling rain if you let it

Cast aside your chains in a new way
Feel the healing
Let the feeling take you in control
Body, heart and soul
In a new way

Life can be so unforgiving
When you get it wrong
Treat you without mercy
Do you down

I can't shake the feeling, something has to change
What in the world is this
Something inside me denied
Well, you say you have to leave me
Baby, I'm mystified

I feel like a train on a broken track
I can't move forward and I can't roll back
What in the world can I do
Now that your sweet love has died
You say you have to leave me
Baby, I'm mystified

How can I break from the past

Colin Blunstone,"From rafters of memory
And deep grim lodges
Housed in siblings' far off game chambers
Comes the rain, oh Lord
And it reflects my tears, which originally grew in mirrors
Oh windows of illusion

And the rain fell, like ball bearings on a roulette wheel
Eliminating the future
And I saw ghosts, they were children
Running through a cedar boulevard
Into a wood
They came to a gate and looked inside
It was raining
And they heard a soft moaning, warm and plural

And the rain fell, on the lake, in the vast garden
Faster and faster
It was dark
Suddenly children were everywhere
Gliding along the lake, running through the trees
The stars arranged themselves like an illuminated skipping rope
The trees were rich and high, and mingled with the stars
As jewels complement skin

Come, jump across the lake
Into he branches
Higher than the clouds

Let the rain fall
From secret passageways
And oak casements come these spirits
Out of their sleepy silver webs
They play with the forgotten animals at night
And patter on our windows when we sleep
Only the rain has such soft fingers
Only the rain",Only the Rain

Through heaven and hell and in between
Fate is the frame sometimes deceives us
When it cruelly leads to broken hopes and dreams

Comfort me when all the world's in vain
Shelter me should I run for cover
Show me the sun when all I can feel
Is the rain

Sympathy, warmth and understanding
With every breath of your love bequeathed
And I'll know I can get save landing
Even though the storm may rise
From deep beneath

Will you be my sanctuary
Be for me when all the world's in vain
Let me know your true devotion
Open my eyes when I feel them
Closing with pain

When all around seems to be trouble
When life seems only to deceive
When nothing really seems to matter
And I look in desperation
For something I can believe

There for me when all the world's in vain
Shelter me when I run for cover

And kick like a tin can in the shape of a man
Trying so hard to break in so I can burst out
Perspectives ever changing leaving me in doubt

I've got a chronic disorder, I'm balanced between
The edge of a razor, trying to cut clean
I've got my eyes on the road, I'm trying to keep steady
I've got my hands on the wheel
I feel, I'm nearly ready

Hope that me who's dreaming and that's not me who's screaming
Want to wake up warm in a tattered down tarn
Still for all the killing, there's nobody winning
I want to spit it out, I want to scream and shout

Lying in the gutter, I heard someone mutter
We'll creep in the shadows trying to get home
Like the swing in the see-saw, hard to keep steady
With some rearranging

Oh, you're born alone and die the same
In between can take a while
Only one drop in the sea of time
Sometimes makes it hard to smile

If you find someone to share your life
Things are never quite the same
Years we have traveled seem like days gone past
And we've known so little pain

At this point in time I stand alone
To the phone I'm holding on
Outside people stare as if to say
We know there's nobody home

Hold me when you're lonely
Hold me when you're lonely

When the papers read that all is lost
Only darkness lies ahead
I'll speak softly and soothe and chase the fear
And on me you rest your head

When the nights are hot with heavy air
Or it's freezing to the bone
You may lie drunk in the city square
You may feel lost and forlorn

Hold me when you're lonely
Hold me when you're lonely

I tried talking to Jesus, but he just put me on hold
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And He could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists

When you've given up the drink and those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up I watch it as it sets

My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss

I know it's cruel, the times that we lose
Blame it on my misplaced heart

Lessons never learned
With every mile that you burn
If only a moment you're alone
You're lost without a way home

Ooh, everyday is a moment
It's in the faces passing by
I know it's true
But what's the use
Blame on my misplaced heart
I know it's true
The times that we lose
Blame it on my misplaced heart
Blame it on my misplaced, heart.",Misplaced Heart
Colin James,"Too many miles to understand
How I let you slip through my hands
Tell me what can I do?
I crashed my hope and learned to lose
I watched the darkness make it's move
Yeah, there's no life without you

I've been waiting for the sun to shine
Kicking holes into the long night
I tried so hard to get it right, yeah, yeah
Now I'm standing in the shadow of love
You're still all that I'm thinking of
I'm standing in the shadow of love without you

The world I know, it disappears
The words I speak are hard
To hear and nobody cares
I cross the line and trip the wires
Fell into a dirty fire, I've been burning
There's no life without you

I've been waiting for the sun to shine
Kicking holes into the night
I tried so hard to get it right, get it right
I'm standing in the shadow of love
You're still all that I'm thinking of
I'm standing in the shadow of love without you

Time to kill the pain you gave me
Time to lose the shame that shamed me
Shadow of you made me lonely

Colin James,"Well I can remember
Like it was only yesterday
Love was young and foolish
Like a little child at play
But oh how love has changed
I never knew how easily
Now I'm just a shadow
Of the boy I used to be
Yeah yeah

And when I write the book
About my love
It will be about a man
Who was torn in half
By his hope and ambition
Wasted through the years
The man will be written
On every page in tears
When I write, When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love

I was a fool to my self
When I kept on running around
I've been a little better
Oh when I tried settling down
Maybe some magic moment
You never know but not for long
But all too soon the magic
Was in a moment gone

And when I write the book
About my love
It will be a heart breaking story
About love and luck
And when I get down on the pages
All I have felt
It will make the hardest heart of the critics heart melt
When I write, When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love

When I was young love was fun
I was so happy
I looked so good
And I dressed so happy
Two tone shoes on my feet
Big old smile on my face
As I moved, moved, grooved
All over the place
Now I'm down on my luck
And my complexion is bad
Because my love love life
Is sadder than sad

And when I write the book
About my love
It will be a hard publication
Tougher than tough
When I get down on the pages
All I've amassed
It will shoot to the top
Of the bestsellers list

When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love

On the street of crowns 
I passed every streetlight in my hometown 
I tried every screen door

And now I know that I may never find my home

And all the lights were low 
Hey valentine are you ready to go 
You can shake the hand that knocked down Rome 
And still I know that I may never find my home

What your sweet love is doin' to me 
All my chains of promise and my heart of stone

May never find my home

We kicked around
From stairway to station
We made a sensation
With the gadabout crowd
And oh, what a bargain
We're two easy targets
For the old men at the off-tracks
Who've paid in palaver
And crumpled old dollars
Which we squirreled away
In our rat trap hotel by the freeway
And we slept-in Sundays

Your cool was contagious
At the old school
You left without leaving
A note for your grieving
Sweet mother, while
Your brother was so cruel
And here in the alleys
Your spirits were rallied
As you learned quick to make a fast buck
In bathrooms and barrooms
On dumpsters and heirlooms
We bit our tongues.
Sucked our lips into our lungs
Till we were falling
Such was our calling

And here in our hovel
We fuse like a family
But I will not mourn for you
So take off your makeup
And pocket your pills away
We're kings among runaways
On the bus mall
We're down
On the bus mall

Among all the urchins and old Chinese merchants
Of the old town, 
We reigned at the pool hall
With one iron cue ball
And we never let the bastards get us down
And we laughed off the quick tricks
The old men with limp dicks
On the colonnades of the waterfront park
As 4 in the morning came on, cold and boring, 
We huddled close
In the bus stop enclosure enfolding
Our hands tightly holding

My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness

And woman, I will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Please remember, my life is in your hands, and woman
Hold me close to your heart, however distant don't keep us apart

That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?

That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

Leaves me lonely and afraid.

Collin Raye,"All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind 
From time to time
I can never be more 
Than a knock on your door
Just a shadow that's gone 
With the sunshine
For you know I'm not free 
And I never can be 
And you're bound 
To get restless in time
All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind

Tonight I shed 
A silent tear 
While lyin' here with you
The sands of time 
Have trickled down 
To just a precious few
You're young and so beautiful 
And I'm so glad I'm here
But the ending is painfully clear

All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
Of someone you had 
To leave behind
Who loves you and needs you 
But never could give you
The ring for your finger so fine
So tonight we'll just borrow 
Each other tomorrow 
We'll find that we've run out of time
And all I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind

For you know I'm not free

Collin Raye,"I got money in my pocket 
And a guitar in my hand
These lonely nights without you 
Are more than I can stand
I work like a puppet but it's time 
To cut the strings
Well I hit the ground running 
And I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive 
Headed down a one way track
It won't take too long 
Just you wait and see
As long as it will lead me back to you 
Any old stretch of blacktop will do

North, south, east, or west 
Been everywhere it seems
Hotels rooms and honky tonks 
Don't feel like home to me
I'll be stepping out the rhythm 
While I'm singing a brand new song
And it's knowing where I'm going 
That will keep me moving on

Turn my collar to the wind 
And put my thumb up in the air
Flag a diesel down 
Or catch a bus from anywhere
Colorado, California or even Kalamazoo
As long as it will lead me back to you 
Any old stretch of blacktop will do

Collin Raye,"I hear your favorite music on the jukebox 
And right away I know that you are here
You always pick a time just when I think 
My mind is clear you reappear
And once again you've got me in your power 
This time I hope it's not a brief romance

Cause it's too late to run 
You've got me thinking one slow dance 
Is worth a chance
Then that old blue magic 
Still works like a charm
As if you never even left 
These aching arms
You put a spell on me 
I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic in your eyes

Though I should run and hide from this illusion
Your smile is so much quicker than my pride
There's something up your sleeve 
That makes my heart believe inside

This carpet ride might lift us up 
And fly us to forever
But up till now 
It's all been slight of hand
I've got to face the fact one look and 
I'm right back again at your command
Cause that old blue magic

Yes you put a spell on me 
I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic that old blue magic 
That blue magic in your eyes",Blue Magic
Collin Raye,"Well listen dear I think it's clear we need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been having second thoughts
Well I must confess in a way I guess that silly notion's true
Cause every second you're not here with me I think of you
Every second every minute every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask if I have second thoughts I guess I'd have to say
Every second every minute every hour of every day

Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favorite music on and hold each other close
Don't worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay
Every second every minute every hour of every day
Every second every minute,
Every second every minute I love you more and more each day",Every Second

Looking for my heart
Each time I turn out the light 
I can count on you to start
Bringing back sweet memories 
Of the love we made
You never change 

You're a faithful old flame
I know you'll be here right on time 
To tear me up again
You never stay away too long 
And give me a chance to mend
Tears won't drown your fire in me 
It's even worse when it rains

You never stray from a faithful old flame
Just when I think you're gone 
You start the fire 
And I yearn for your touch
That I miss so much
Embers of love glow even brighter 
Than they did yesterday 

They won't go away

But the spark remains
It's still the same

Collin Raye,"You want to know where we go from here
So many roads but none that seem clear
Is what we have enough to last a whole life through
Who knows baby who knows
So you're asking me what do we do

Cause time moves so fast and the chances seem so few
Is it too much to think that we could have it all
Who knows we may never know

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all it's worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you I'd fall in love with me

So hold me close I'll kiss away your fears
I won't promise the moon but I promise to be here
And what if together it gets better every day

It's not the love we knew that hurts me but the love we could have known
I'm not sorry that I held you I just wish that I still could

I don't regret one moment that we had together
What's killing me is knowing we could've had forever
I just wish we loved each other the way I know we could
Oh it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good

I don't want to lose the mem'ries of all the nights we shared
And I never found a new love that ever could compare

Collin Raye,"I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three.
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me. He said,
""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so.""

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.
Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
Of her, I found this letter, and this is what it said:

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. Love, me.

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away,
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;
But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through,
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. Love, me.
Between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. Love, me.","Love, Me"

Getting better with each page
Somewhere in the middle 
I somehow lost my place
Then came the final chapter where 
You said we were through
And left me living 
Sadly ever after loving you
Oh sadly ever after 
Since you said goodbye
With just one little word 
You wrote me right out of your life
You found a new prince charming 
Now I'm a royal shade of blue
Alone and living 
Sadly ever after loving you

Now the story that I'm writing 
Is a sad sad tale to tell
'Bout a man who loved someone 
Who loved somebody else
But I wish that it was fiction 
But heaven knows it's true

And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River

And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl that southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you Big River when you called

Then you took me to St Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone said boy she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now won't you batter down by Boton Rouge River Queen roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans
Go on I've had enough dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you Big River more than me

His old man told many a tale
How his great grandad used to go drovin' 
Back and forth on the Oachezown Trail
Now you might say the boy got infected 
By a fantasy of the old west

For his heart and his soul got connected 
To a spirit that won't let him rest
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle 
He don't spend his nights round a fire
He lifts diesel oil that is horses required
But he is a latter day cowboy 
Dressed as a truck driving man
Driving his wheels 
And his dreams to Cheyenne

He beds down by the side of the highway 
At the sight of the first evening star
In the darkness his big pony idles 
As he quietly strums his guitar
And he sings out a song of his sweetheart 
Even as her sweet mem'ry grows dim
And he sings of the trail he has chosen 
But the actual fact is the trail chose him
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle

You're an angel of no mercy,
But I don't mind.

Ain't it  strange how love can take,
A heart that's hard as steel,
Hold it tightly in  the fire,
And teach that cold heart how to feel.

I swore that I'd loved you 
And I can't change that now
They tell me I'm free to find someone new

I just don't have the heart 
Cause I gave mine to you
I said my love would last for all time 
And no one would take your place
Well if that promise was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it I'm a man of my word

I'm a man of my word and it's cost me so dear
Cause those words are a prison without you here

I can't win for losing try as I might

It ain't just nothing a little love won't cure

I'm licking my wounds here in second place

It ain't nothing just a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight

It's been one of these days I should've stayed in bed
I've been gettin' my brains worn out instead

I was sure that by now you'd have let yourself go
I've been living my heart out, and without any shame
gotten down on my knees just to kindle this flam

But tonight I am down to the wire
I've been striking these matches in vain
Got a whole lot of smoke but no fire
'Cause you got a heart full of rain

Now somewhere in your history there's a reason or two
Why you won't let a body get close to you
Why the truth that I whisper always sounds like a lie
Why you're drowning inside from the tears you don't cry

But your eyes have never been dryer
And you smile like you're felling no pain
Got a whole lot of smoke but no fire

And I love being wrong when it feels like it feels tonight
I'd a whole lot rather be here in your arms than be right
Now that we're together, wish I hadn't waited so long

I got carried away and let the music,
Go to my head.
Well she shouldn't have worn that dress,

That it had gotten in the mood to lose control.

Oh no!
When did neon light turn into moon glow?
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance,
With her arms around me,
One more long glance,
And nothing will slow down me,
I've got no chance,
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge.

All I wanted to be was cool.
It ain't my style to over heat,
Much less burn.
But as we floated across the floor,
All at once I flashed right past the point,
Of no return.
And when we said goodnight,
The sun was on the rise,
And any stars that hadn't set,
Had fallen in my eyes.

Nervous and scared
He knew both the thrill and the cost

Was his last chance to see what he'd lost

And upstream's where he needed to be
He set his sights on the past
Finished his glass
And went back in history

And watched the whole room fade to black

But he's no fool, he knows
How hard it will be to come back
But tonight he's tired of the lonely
And tomorrow will not be the cure
So he'll just slip away
Find yesterday
And spend one more night with her

He's just one more fool who talks to himself
But every man in this place would line up
If they knew what that seat really was (but)

They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash

But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my credo 'til mornin' is nigh

Close by me forever and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in my tender care
And take us to Heaven, to live with Thee there

Collin Raye,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor Shepard's in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then they looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Born is the kind of Israel

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,

Even more than I usually do
And although I know, it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas

",I'll Be Home for Christmas
Collin Raye,"One frozen night in 1914 at the height of World War One
The unthinkable happened
All along the entire western front
The British and German soldiers lay down their weapons
In an unofficial cease fire to celebrate Christmas Eve together

They exchanged gifts and saw each other as brothers
And that peace lasted for two more days
When they were ordered back to battle

In those few days, though
Men remembered the reason for Christmas
Amongst the devastation
And it's a story that should never be forgotten

Through the smoke filled night
Silence rolls from both sides
Across a bloody battlefield
It was a cold Christmas Eve in 1914
For those who were there it seemed unreal

As time was still, the spirit moved the soldiers
To lay down their arms, raise their voice in song
And pretend for a while the war was over

If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last

As opposing sides approached
Through broken words they spoke
It wasn't long before they felt at ease
They shared their cigarettes
What they had they used as gifts
They didn't feel like enemies

With candles lit, they stood shoulder to shoulder
And on that field they found true common ground
And as they prayed, they dreamed the war was over

If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last

If it could happen then, it could happen again
",It Could Happen Again
Collin Raye,"O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night, divine
Oh night, when Christ was born

Oh night, divine
Oh night
Oh, night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
Oh, praise His name forever
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
His power and glory ever more proclaim

Oh night, divine
Oh night, when Christ was born
His power and glory ever more proclaim

So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner

She said, you didn't hear it from me
All I'll say is mama's got that place out in Monterrey

Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo

Two towns back I showed your photograph
And the gas station man just started to laugh
She said I might see you in this bucket of rust
And said good luck boy, just follow that cloud of dust

Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo

Maybe I was straddling the fence just like she said
It took her leaving to get it through my head

She's the one and only, it's over, that's it
I'm committed, I'm in love and I'm desperate
She's a good ways gone but I'm closin' the gap
If I have to I'll chase her clear across the map

Well I thought I'd forget you, but I guess I forgot to,
and lately I've been too confused to think.
When I reach for someone new, it's like I'm touching you.

I can still feel you just as close as skin, every now and then.
All by myself, in a crowded room, on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you.
I can still feel you

In everything that moves,
in everything I do

I can still feel you just as close as skin, every now and then.
All by myself, in a crowded room, on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you.
I can still feel you",I Can Still Feel You
Collin Raye,"Looking out my window 
See you playing in the leaves
It's amazing how a little girl 
Means all the world to me
When I tell you that I love you 
I love you more than words can say
Smile say cheese pretty please 
I want to take your picture
How'd you ever get so big 
I gotta take your picture
And hold on to the mem'ry before 
The whole things slips away
I wish I could save these moments 
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop 
The world from turning 
Keep things just the way they are
I wish I could shelter you from 
Everything not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't 
But I wish I could

When you kiss me for no reason 
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me 
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed 
You whisper ""daddy we forgot to pray""
I wish I could save these moments

When I watch you sleeping 
All my worries slip away
A little bit of heaven 
Close on your gentle face
I wish I could save these moments",I Wish I Could
Collin Raye,"I'm watching you go from room to room 
With all your boxes and your broom
Packing up, sweeping out and taking down 
From off the wall
Everything that's part of us 
Tear my whole world down if you must
Don't even leave one little speck of dust 
Make sure you've got it all
Take my heart, take my soul, 
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here 
To catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity 
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl 
Before you leave 
And make sure you've got it all

Don't even leave one photograph 
The memory of one smile or laugh
Check the closet up in the attic 
And down the hall
Take your time, take your rings, 
Take the sandbox and the swings
Without a family, oh they're just things 
Make sure you've got it all
Take my heart, take my soul
Take one last look around, girl 
Before you leave 
And make sure you've got it all",Make Sure You've Got It All
Collin Raye,"I ain't gonna lie to you and say it didn't hurt
To see you with someone new and you were wearing my old blue shirt
But it didn't kill me until we said hello
And I became someone you used to know

Like a friend like a fool like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love didn't we share or don't you even care
I know we said we were through but I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved to someone you used to know

If you didn't tell him about those weekends at the coast
Or how we use to argue about who loved who the most
Well, I guess I won that one cause I still need you so
But to you I'm just someone you used to know

Like a friend like a fool like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love didn't we share or don't you even care
I know we said we were through but I never knew how quickly I would go

Collin Raye,"I think I feel like an old beat up two lane
The one that the state's not about to repair
From where I'm falling I think I might meet you
Below where we were just above just don't care
The way the world's changing I just can't accept it

No right or wrong all in between
The faith we were raised on is weathered and shaken
But baby it don't have to be
Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
Passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there

Well I've never been to that part of the country
Save for some old movies and deep in my mind
Where it's accepted and even rewarded
To stand on your own right side of the line
Nobody wins here we're all scared of losing
I feel scarred right down to the bone
Maybe we'll find ourselves close to the ocean
Where freedom first breathed on it's own
Cause I still believe in a prayer
Oh we've got nothing to keep us",Start over Georgia
Collin Raye,"You've been my best friend all these years
You've kept holding on to me 
Through all the trials and tears
Only you and I could know all 
The sacrifices that let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could've said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter 
I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough 
To fight together in this thing for life

There were times I lost my mind took 
Some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control 
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fadin' fast
We held each other close until the rain have passed
We're survivors

A little time and tenderness has 
Seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side when 
The final smoke has cleared
We're survivors
Together in this thing for life",Survivors
Collin Raye,"Today the air cleared up 
The lights came on bright
Years of heavy weight 
In a moment turned light
I'd thought love could only look dark 
As if through a glass
I just turned into an open book 
Readin' easy at last
Tonight my walls came down like 
A brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground I'm not sure when
But baby you're how the walls came down

I've never trusted much 
Got my reasons like most
Stayed well protected from 
Every thorn on each rose
Taking those wayward trips 
Only to turn back and run
Sailing all my relationships 
Could not have dreamed up this one
Tonight my walls came down

You make sense to me in a world where 
Just a few things do make sense to me
In your heart I'll put my trust 
Through whatever is in front of us
Tonight my walls came down
Ooh baby you're how the walls came down
Oh baby you're how the walls came down",The Walls Came Down

To try counting sheep as they're jumpin' the fence

But the fence has a hole
And the sheep snuck out
Their tails are wagging 
Back and forth in celebration
Farmer Sam is calling out their names
But he's yelling to loud, and I can't get to sleep
And it's all on account
Of those runaway sheep
Now they're out in the woods eating ice-cream and cake

Dancing 'round and around
That's why I'm awake
Unless I'm dreaming
This is all too silly to be really happening
They've all got party hats
Every one of those sheep has a bell on it's neck

Going ring-a-ding-ding
I'm a nervous wreck

Could you please take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything

I know you're listening in the silence of this night
The news is blistering but I hold on to your light
And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a father's prayer
I know I can't do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget

She just looked at me as she finished her tale
And her blank expression went another shade pale of grey
There was nothin' to say
In the shadows of her face, I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said

Don't you sit and judge me
From some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug off
Until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
'Cause there are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

Well I put the cuffs on her
And I put her in the car
And I walked in and he was on the floor
Stone dead
Shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by his chair
And a starving baby with nothin' to wear
But tears
You know, the picture was clear

He had finally pushed her farther than the line
And the badge I wore had lost all of it's shine

But I didn't see any and I could see just fine
And I made up my mind

So I took the cuffs off her
And I took her back in
I wiped off the gun
And wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper told in black and white
Just another senseless case of suicide
Oh, just a suicide

Oh but don't you sit and judge me

Collin Raye,"She was singin' ?Love Me Tender? at the local karaoke
I knew right then and there I had found my one and only
She takes my breath away every time I see her
I just couldn't wait for all my boys to meet her
She's got season tickets and sweet, pouty lips
She's all that, well equipped

She's all that, she loves to ride in my pickup truck
She's all that, Mom and Daddy can't believe my luck
She's all that, she looks so good we never wait in line
She's all that, she's all mine

She can throw a split finger and she's got her own glove
When she sinks a twenty footer, man i know I'm in love
Saturday night, she's like a time bomb tickin'
She looks better on Sunday than Mama's fried chicken
She only gets mad when she misses sportscenter
She's all that, even tempered

She's all that, she swings a nine handicap
She's all that, she looks sexy in a baseball cap
She's all that, she makes me want to lay it all on the line
She's all that, she's all mine

Whoa she's a perfect combination
Whoo, she got my defense off the field
Oh, every day's an education
She's got my head a spinnin' like a spoke inside a wheel

She's all that, I'm in touch with her feminine side
She's all that, let me tell you, man, it's one sweet ride
She's all that, a hum-dinger, boy, straight off the blocks
No doubt about it that girl rocks

Who had all the answers
The one I would lean on
For comfort, for strength
She's never forgotten
One grandchild's birthday
Now she can't remember my name
And it makes me so angry
I shake my fist
And cry out to the heavenly one
Why would you play
Such a cold hearted trick
I thought your job was to love
And the answer came down from above

She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places

Are just way too heavy it seems

Who saw things so clearly
The one who could pick out
One crumb on the floor
She saw through a white lie
Saw me through love's eyes
She hardly can see anymore
And it makes me so sad
And it just isn't fair
Why should so much be taken away
But when I cry out
For all that she's lost
I silently hear someone say

She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use

Love didn't stay a mystery for very long
We could do no wrong
Then she called to say
She was late
So we took a little drive upstate
And took care of that
Yeah, we just took care of that

Now I'm looking back on

Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges

My old man
He had it rough
Cause like his daddy
When he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me
So with angry words
I was gone
And I never even tried to come back home
The night he died
Momma said he apologized

Like moon light on the sea
The way your body calls me
Like a secret melody
The way you start a fire
When you look into my eyes
The way you always love me
Until I'm satisfied

There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you

Exactly what I need

Collin Raye,"I remember when baseball was everything
It was little league, but what a big game
There were two men on and one man out
I got a fastball hanging outside
I swung that bat with all my might
And the ball was gone
They say I knocked the cover off
It was the only homer that I ever had
You should of seen my dad

[Chorus]
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me
As long as I'm holding on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me
The devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keeping it here inside me
As long as I live and breathe
The ball was soaring and the crowd was roaring
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

I was nineteen, it was a good job
Moving TV's on a loading dock
Till the boss said, ""son
Try to lose every seventh one
I got it worked out with a good friend
Keep your mouth shut, and we'll cut you in
Now what do you say
Don't you want to be rich one day""
I lost a real good job that night
But I kept my pride

[Chorus]

And sometimes it feels like
My best years are behind me
Then somehow, out of nowhere
Something sneaks up to remind me
Like this morning, I woke up
To a little voice that spoke up
Saying, ""daddy, please
Fix a bowl of rice krispies
You're the bestest friend that I ever had
You know I love you dad""

I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest. 
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.

Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama?s white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
As my hands closed around your waist.
And we were holding each other, dancing with no music playing

Ohhhh, there's nothing to say
Youuu take me away
Dancing with no music playing
Oh, dancing with no music playing

Me in my old faded Levi?s, you in your blue cotton dress
Time it don't have no effect on the way that you still steal my breath. 
As we spin once more across the cold kitchen floor,
Your warm cheek touches my face,
And I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing

I was lost
On the outside
I almost gave up
I almost put love aside
Then I saw you
A little spark, then a flame
I felt the blood rush a million miles an hour
Through my veins
I'm not ready for this
One last breath and a kiss
'Cause my heart knows you're the one
And baby living without you
Would mean living is done
I'd say

Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ""I love you""
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

So stop the war
Bring back the light
Life without you
Would be like autumn leaves
In black and white
Didn't we have it all
More depth than the sea
It's cruel to take a fragile heart
And promise love that life can't keep
I'm not ready to fall
Just let go of it all
'Cause I don't wanna love just to lose
I heard it's sad
But the life you live is the life that you choose
But without you

Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ""I love you""
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

Everywhere I see your face
(I see your face)
I see your grace
And then it's gone
I can't walk on
I can't walk on

Turn off the sun

Oh, there would be no point
No reason to live
'Cause without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

I'm writin' this letter, my darlin, from high on a hill.

We've been marchin' ten days and we're just outside Hawkinsville.

It's been snowin' all night and we ain't got no more kersosene.

It's colder than hell,

Hope you're doin' well,

Josephine.


There's a fever in camp and our boys are too sick to fight.

We done lost ol' Calvin;

Weaver won't make it through the night.

I overheard the Captain say it's the worst he's ever seen.

I'm losin' some weight

but I'm still standin' up straight,

Josephine.


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right

And just one more thing:

I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.


There's three thousand Union troops camped at the river below.

And six hundred of us -

At least there was two nights ago.

Will Irwin deserted and

They hung him down by the stream.

Good God, I'm so scared,

Keep me in your prayers,

Jospehine.


The order came down: we attack tonight at nightfall.

If we can stop 'em right here

We can win this war, once and for all.

You know, I killed a Union boy last week -

Bet he wasn't fourteen.

He looked just like our son,

Forgive me for what I've done,

Josphine.


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right

And just one more thing:

I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.


And lastly, my darling, in case I should be killed...

Don't grieve me too long

Promise me that you will

Marry another and don't let him treat our babies mean,

And when he's holding you, won't you think of me too, Josephine?


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right

And just one more thing:

I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.


Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.

Collin Raye,"There's a reason for the sunshine sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love lights shines
All around us

So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the summer nights
With your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Just let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason for the warm, sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love lights shine
All around us

So let the wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Oh, feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back, no, you can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Just let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

Just let your love flow
Why don't you let your love flow?

Let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean

Collin Raye,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I used to wake up afraid to face the day
Almost counting on something going wrong
I'd get scared thinking I was all alone
But now there's comfort in knowing I belong
In your arms, wrapped up in your love
The only place I feel safe enough

With you by my side
I let go and close my eyes
And I feel like I can fly

Collin Raye,"I read a note my Grandma wrote back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me
He said, ""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I love your Grandma so.

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said,

""If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be

But I'm not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then
Til I see you again

I'll be loving you
Love, Me.""

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away
In the doorway of the church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray
I know I've never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her, his eyes fill up with tears

""If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be

But I'm not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then
Til I see you again

I'll be loving you

Collin Raye,"Nobody thinks about that stuff, like, how tall he might have been
Or how fast he could've run, they just stare as he rolls by
All they see is a helpless kid with no chance to live a life
If they only knew

He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred-yard dash
Climbing up a snow-capped mountain and planting his flag
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his Mama's prayers

He's not jaded or bitter
He's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters

The doctors say no way he'll walk, he just smiles and says
I'm gonna prove you wrong, lots of falls and failed attempts
His legs keep giving out but his heart ain't giving in
What they don't know is

He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred-yard dash
Pushing Earnhardt down the backstretch in a Daytona draft
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his Mama's prayers'

He's not jaded or bitter
He's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters

He pulls himself up on the bars
And takes a long, deep breath
Lifts his right foot off the mat
With all that he has left, he takes a step, one step

Toward his dream of breaking ribbons in a hundred-yard dash
Going long for a touchdown with his buddies out back
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair

He's not jaded or bitter

Collin Raye,"He didn't have the answers
To half the questions his son asked him
A child's mind is a curious thing

But when his son hugged him and said
""Dad you know I love you, how much do you love me?""
Daddy didn't have to think

With his arms open wide just as far as they could go
He said, ""As far as I can reach is not enough to show
I would give my life for you, you are my flesh and blood
I love you this much""

She stood there crying
Broken-hearted looking up at him
And said, ""Son why are you doing this?""

He looks down at her wanting to hold her
And wipe her tears away, 
but he has to leave and that's the way it is

Drove in the nails as the rain came down

Oh no, not in springtime
Summer, winter or fall
No, never could I leave you at all

And could I leave you running
Merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire glow?

If ever I would leave you
How could it be in springtime?
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so

Oh no, not in springtime
Summer, winter or fall
No, never could I leave you at all

Colm Wilkinson,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific]

Elle est en seconde dans un lyc??e de banlieue,
Sort avec un mec de sont quartier depuis peu,
Il est comme elle l'aime c'est ?? dire un peu plus vieux,
Il a l'air amoureux, ils ont tout pour ??tre heureux...

Elle l'a jamais fait elle attendait juste le bon gas,
La elle se dit ''bingo'' il sont seul dans la twingo,
Donc ??a va swinguer, elle enl??ve son tanga, 
Et r??ussi le ace comme Tsonga

Oui mais voila 9 mois plus tard il assume pas et se sauve comme un b??tard,
Elle a d??couvert qu'en fait il est f??tard,
R??sultat elle se retrouve seule dans cette histoire.

Elle se rappellera le jour o?? elle annon??a,
O?? elle annon??a ?? sa m??re et son papa
Elle annon??a qu'elle ??tait enceinte de 3 mois,.
Elle ne s'attendais pas ?? ce qu'il saute de joie,

Pour trouver quelqu'un qui veuille bien la renseigner,
Je crois qu'on n'est pas V.I.P comme Mathilde Seigner,
De ne pas l??cher l'affaire ??a lui a enseign??, ooh

On a tous connu une fille dans le cas d'Aur??lie,
Une pour qui grossesse est synonyme de d??lit,
Rejet??e par ses amis mais surtout sa famille,
Qui n'acceptent pas qu'elle souhaite donner la vie,
Voila ce que je dirais si je devais donner mon avis,
Mettre un enfant au monde ne devrais pas ??tre punis,
C'est la plus belle chose qui soit et si tu le nies,
C'est que tu n'a rien compris...

Qu'on se fasse des purs voyages, t'inquiètes ça sera pas la campagne
À base de données en pagne, on pète le champagne
À Miami, le Brésil, le Maroc ou l'Espagne

Yo, why you want to? play me like that?
Girl, every time I see you
You're with a different man

You tell 'em that you love ?em
And then take every thing you can
You're living life in the fast lane
You're no longer Daddy?s girl

Can't stay with just one man 
You gotta? love them all around the world

And I know just what you are

So you better make up your mind
Are you gonna? let somebody love you

So you have no need to steal

If pretty looks could kill

Must you even try to take what I have earned
Just wait your turn, from what I see 
You got a lot to learn about life, being a wife or

Even just being my girl
Is false hype so word, change you attitude
You gotta learn to show some gratitude
Yeah, I'm on your trip but girl don't flip

'Cause I'm hip to the way you trip so just skip
All the fun and games, I know you're a faker

You think you're gettin' over, well take a look at the score
Yo 1,2,3, yep you're outta here, I?, letting you go
Savin' the rest of my tears, for someone who will
Treat me right like I should be, not tryin' to break my heart
Nor take my money, just like you drove me 
Then you been driven, so get out of my life 
And get into the hard livin'

Color Me Badd,"She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her ears

Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
And if allowed but one possession
I will pick her from the garden to be mine, mine

Be careful how you touch her, for she?ll awaken
And sleeps the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying, for a debt she never owes
And the silent wind still blows, that only she can hear, so she goes

Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Cry, for she's a lady
Dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild
She's a free and gentle flower

To fantasize about what might have been

But you say you’re happy 
So maybe it’s for the better 
But you say you’re happy

I’d like them well enough 
If they would just shut up 
But we will persevere 
By sheer force of will 
We’ll stoically endure 
This social overkill

At a restaurant on the third floor 
You sat down across from me with a bottle of wine 
Shook my hand and started to pour

We shared our life stories and a view of the stage 
Falling in love from afar 

Though it feels like they’ve played out 
The same act a million times 
A routine struggling just to keep 
From falling asleep reciting their lines 
You say this is the way we’re meant 
To enjoy the opera 
At a safe distance 

We’ve met at this table now ten years in a row 
To see the same opera performed 
Recreating the scene down to the slightest detail 
The night our tradition was born 
Attendance is low but still the show must go on 
The participants gossip offstage 
The waiter assures us that the wine is the same 
I guess it gets bitter with age

This isn’t a game

Who cares? I’ll recover 

I want to rip my heart out 
Throw it on the ground 
I want to scream your name out 
Just to hear the sound but

Fill our dreams as we lie here together 
Too close, too close 

I broke out in laughter when you told me that 
Being with me is like being alone 
But I knew you meant it as a compliment

I toss and turn with what to
Do or to say when you come home

So what if your hair smells like cologne?
We know you've done it all before 

I saw your careful thoughts collide the day you told me everything
Beneath the guilt you wore a pride in what you felt was honesty
But you weren't counting the lies
Three months of silence had to bring
I can forgive
Don't look surprised
I only ask one little thing 

Forget his mouth
Forget his eyes
Forget a thousand little lies
Forget you ever had a choice
Forget his name
Forget his voice 

I never claimed that I was perfect
I suppose it was implied
So were you driven to his arms by my imperfect sense of pride?
Or perhaps something you read
Or the way I made love to you desperately, desolately
I guess that you were desperate too 

I always loved the things in you that I could never be
But there must be a side of you I wasn't meant to see
Show me
Though my heart should be barren
Still my love for you grows
Like the weeds that destroy the flowers

And the melody in my heart 
Still echoes inside

But I still smell the rain 
And remember the songs 

I hold them close never letting go 
Seeking a world I'll never find

Still echoes inside.",Fade So Fast

Still you wince 

When will you let yourself love me more? 
When will you let yourself love me 
All the way? 

I love the way you radiate 
An inner strength and pride 
And holding back is sometimes justified

Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too

Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said

Been round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come in and then go

Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin' gunna happen
Most country folks sing, but I couldn't, so I'm rappin'

And invite y'all all down to any country town

There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand

And not into things for cheep thrills

And he's rappin' we gottas play him
Folks been waitin' for some one like me
To give 'em some hot beats and spit that country

Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country til the day I'm dead

See, country folks eat biscuits called cat heads
Bar-b-q, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right,

Got four-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby
We don't want 'em! So now y'all all know exactly who I am

That don't mean a thing, you see
I'm still that same ol' country boy
And that's all I'll ever be, and sometime
Those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country

Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models

And there's some of us livin' in every town

You thought your boy Colt Ford was just a country clown
That bails hay all day and don't know how to get down
Ain't none of ya'll messing with this country sound
Them boys sent me with some new country
We rock Fords and lift kits with gun racks and mud on 'em
Ain't scared of nothing so don't push the button
Like them long legged girls with curls and tight jeans
And they love cold beer round here with chicken wings
Baby this new country is all about me but I love some Johnny Cash, Waylon, and Willie.
Respect the old school and make room for the new
Now tell me you don't love what this country boy can do
Go get the skoal spit with the lighter style
Big boy so cool I make all them girls smile
So tell me what you need and old Colt will make it happen
Thangs is changing we got a country boy rappin'

When they talk about the south they call it dirty baby
We was raised on cheese grits biscuits and gravy
We say sir and ma'am and we don't give a damn
If you like it or not we gonna hold our spot
Give me crown and coke or maybe jack and sprite
A case of Coors light and its on tonight
We talking about a party down on Johnson's farm
Late night country trouble we don't mean no harm
That's just how we do so tell me what you want
Some say they will but still most won't
Keep it banging till the sun come up hear the rooster crow then its time to go
Cause there's horses that need breakin' and cows that need pennin'
I do what it takes to keep them girls grinnin'
Every girl crazy about a bow legged boy
In tight jeans and boots that rope rides the chutes

It ain't rained in a month
Mama done took a job part time at the five and dime
Lord, times is hard, Daddy's pride is really hurtin', feelin' less than a man
Workin' dark to dark, how much more can he stand?
I ain't never seen him cry now I'm seventeen
Quarterback, first train, gave my high school ring
To the prettiest little girl, green eyes and red hair.
I think I might ask her to marry me tonight at the fair.
I ain't never been so torn, should I stay or leave?
Get out of this small town, am I lettin' 'em down?
I could even play ball somewhere in the fall
Live the big city life, I guess I could have it all

Man, how do you decide between real life and a dream?
Lovin' ya Ma and Pa, ya girl, and ya team
Trying to figure out the next move to make,
Trying to figure out the right road to take.
Dying to get out, but still afraid to roam.
Is it wrong to wanna leave the only place I've known?
Life as I know it is just simple and plain:
Chores, school, and practice, everyday is the same.

I'm tired of the routine and everyone knowing me.
I'm dreaming of everything the t.v. is showing me.
They promised me a full ride to UCLA,
But that's a whole 'nother world for small town G.A.
Lord, I'm askin', I hope you hear my prayer
'Cause I'm torn between here and what I see over there
I pray someway that you could give me a sign
Tell me which way to go 'cause I sure don't know

Lord, we're one win away from winning it all,
And I'm a plane flight away from seeing my first ball
I can finally see the ocean and stars of Hollywood
Say bye to this damn farm, get a tattoo on my arm
Forget these dirt roads and the way I was raised
Chase the bright lights of the California nights
Sports cars and sushi is all I see
When I order some sweet tea they start laughin' at me
Boy, this new life ain't what I thought it would be
Maybe the city life ain't made for me
Now I'm wishing I was fishin' on the lake with Dad,
And starting to realize being country ain't bad
I miss that ol' farm and that red headed girl
Waking up before the sun to help Daddy get it done.
I'm packed and headed back to the place I was born
Proud to be country and no longer torn

Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.

Lord, I'm twisted
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If I should wait or should I go, I just don't know

This song is for everybody, no matter whether you're from a small town,
The hood, the big city, it don't matter everybody's got their dreams they wanna follow
Some people are ashamed of where they're from, they don't know where they're supposed to be
Everybody find your place in life, be proud of who you are
Don't let nothing hold you back

Loves fishin'

She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough

Kinda like chicken and biscuits

She can rock them high heel shoes
But she'd rather wear cowboy boots
Cut off jeans and a baseball hat
Them vity girls can't do it like that
Off the chain on a Friday night
Dancin' and drinkin' ain't scared to fight
By Sunday mornin' come rollin' around
Singin' in the choir is where she's found

Colt Ford,"Let tell y'all a little story

Growing up, I remember one year
My uncle Titus had a bright idea
He's gonna bottle up his own brew
He figured he could make a million or two
Taste wasn't gonna be his claim to fame
What he was banking on was all in the name

He called it Titty's, Titty's, Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinning ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's

He had his marketing plan worked up
He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs
He wouldn't package 'em in a 6 pack
He's gonna sell 'em by the pair and call it a rack
And he was sure it was the next big thing
With Dolly Parton in his ad campaign

Selling Titty's, Titty's, Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinning ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's

Somebody get a nipple for that thing

Happy hour, two for one
Talking 'bout a beer buzz, ooh, son
After work, at the ballgame and shooting a ball
Any time's the right time for a big ol' handful

Titty's, Titty's, Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinning ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's

When you work real hard
And your day is going shitty
What can be better
Than a big ol' mouthful of Titty's

Come on, boys, girls too
Hey Colt, let's get us a six pack on that motorboat
Yeah, I like 'em cold, me too
You know what? Somebody get me a pair of 'em, I'm thirsty

I'm a God-fearing man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell you we're doin' it just right
Got my Playboy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off the Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jennings sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong

With my feet up, lawn chair beat up
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up?
Got it right deep in the sticks, wanna see us?
Front yard golf field bought em, wanna tee up?
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog been every truck throw a G up
Hospital, school and the church one street up
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil lady have a ball every Chri
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck.
I've never been rich but I really don't want much,
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup.

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is

I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked a whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothing like this
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right

Every day work, every day pray
God, family, friends, yeah everybody's friends
A winner never quits, and a quitter never wins
Helps folks in need, don't fall for greed
A jealous man is weak so think before you speak
If you love 'em let 'em know, if you hate let it go
Fast can be fun, but sometimes you need slow
God is all good, the devil is so real
So listen up y'all 'cause this is how I feel

I won't back up, I don't back down

Take my job but not my guns
Tax my check till I ain't got none
Except for the good Lord up above
I answer to no one

See I'm a flag flyin' bible totin' son of a gun
Yeah I'm hell on the hard just a rebel on the run
Scared don't know it, fear don't feel it
The truth is the light, sometimes you gotta fight
Good beats bad, right beats wrong
I'm a ball room preacher and this is my song
I'm climbing for the top, representin' for the country
I'm the people's champ right out the deer camp

Hank Junior supporter, let's protect our border
To hell with anyone who don't believe in the USA

My right to tote the weapon of my choice
Don't censor my voice
Hate me if you want or love me if you can
If the truth is what you want then you found your man

If you think like I think, man crank it on up

Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was

When I think about how it used to be, Lord it was so simple then
Dirt-bike and a fishin' pole at a fishin' hole with all my friends
Nothin' better than a BB gun in my backyard just huntin' squirrels
Took a ring from my mama's drawer and gave it to this little girl
Her mama called mine and then my daddy had to have a talk
I remember like yesterday what he said when we took that walk
""Son don't you ever tell no lie, even if the truth burns""
Everyday my mind goes back to all those lessons learned
And I wanna go

Thought I'd give a million bucks if that old boy was still here
Ain't it funny how time goes by and memories seem to fade away
They built a parking lot on the baseball field we used to play
That skating rink is closed down, but now I see us back again
I remember those all night skates, very first dates and my old friend

My dad's gettin' older now but son he's still as tough as ever
Him and my little boy are best friends now, wish it could last forever

In my shiny new rig where the boys were waiting
Got it all gassed up and the beer rise down
Drove 35 miles outside of town

Where the groundhogs run long after the rain
We can slip, slide, and run this thing
Get it all dirty, break it and ride
Round here trucks get baptized

Washed, washed in the mud
We get it all jacked up, sink it to the struts
Show it some hillbilly love
Gonna get washed, washed in the mud

'Cause it makes the country girls yell, scream and holler
Got a heavy duty wince that'll pull you from a ditch
And set of bull nuts hangin' off a ball hitch

Tools, wipers thumping in time
A sweet little honey sitting by my side
Throw it in low, put it to the test

To celebrate that country life that we all love so much
Now we may not have fancy things and all that glitters ain't gold

I'll never catch her now, so I just put the tailgate down
She's probably somewhere doing 95, I got nothing but this cooler and time

I cracked one waiting on a ride, two or three just to pass the time
While she's headed to a new town and I'm too lost to be found
She probably thinks that I don't care, stuck in the rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I'll be here all night long, man I'm bummed out back road buzzed

When I have a choice to make?
Who do I follow
When my character's at stake?
Will I run from you or to your arms?
Will I fight to be right where you are?
'Cause life is pulling me a million different ways

This is my song that I sing forever
You are my home, you are what I treasure
I want you to be where my heart goes
And if it all breaks
If it goes to pieces
You are the one that I will believe in
I know you won't ever let me go
(You won't let me go)
I want you to be where my heart goes

There's no denying
What this world will promise me
But I have decided
You are the only thing I need
So take everything
Take everything
Take everything

Is exactly how it seems or a clever disguise
A remedy for apologies to make it right
For clarity to see the means through our eyes

Are really only temporary pleasures

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Columbia Ballroom Orchestra,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca [Cha-Cha-Cha] [32BPM]

In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon

Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn’t speak, though I’d love to say
That you’ve stolen my heart away

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

As the music dies, something in your eyes

And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have danced this dance forever

There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who?

But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,

Columbus Jazz Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

We're all demons today,
Come down and feel the pain
Burst right through you,
And makes a hole in your soul.
I don't care what you been told and now I carry you,
And as a soldier of misfortune and ultimate doomsayer;
I want you to feel,
And I know you will,
And everything you see will bleed straight through reveal the truth. 
Anything can happen you say,
I never tried to get it,
I never tried to fit in,
And now I'm falling through.

When ready,
READY,
FIRE!!

I'm human too you know,
Everything,
Soul's dead.
I'm human too you know,
Talented,
Scavengers.
I'll hold you down you'll be my,
Bait I'll throw you to my,
Slaves that stick to my lies and everything is shallow.
I know there's no use to pray,
I am a demon today,
We're all demons today
We drown in soil we're flooded
As it happens,
I'm still trying to be human,
I never tried to fit in now I'm falling through again.

Comeback Kid,"Where have you gone?
How does time pass by so fast
Seems like yesterday
You and I
We could relate
But you know how things change
But is it me? or is it time?
Now I'm stuck looking back
On something that I'll never have again

All this time with regret
I just lost today
Worrying about yesterday

Can't live in yesterday

All this time with regret
I lost today
Worrying about yesterday
I lost today
And no I'll never forget about you
I lost today
I just came to terms that I've lost you

On with my life",All in a Year
Comeback Kid,"Never thought it would be this way.
But this gap between us grew, we grew two separete ways.
I never set out to tear this down, cause in my heart it's worth,
it's worth so much more, than I could ever show.
It's worth more than I can show, with words that I can't say.
The pain is wearing thin, how did this fall apart.
I'm reminded of a time, I thought you'd never slip away.
Was I to quick to run away?
You never know what you have, until it's gone away.
All I have, all I would give,
if there were some way to save this.
Always knew your name.
Some things never change.",Always
Comeback Kid,"What have you become?
Now you fight a losing war.
I look at this and it's all a mess.
Seems like anything that's real, I just can't see.
I can't see the truth in you.
I can't see the real in you.
Show your face and take the world.
But instead, you have to fit the mould.
With this front you're losing respect.
I know you're better than that.
Your time is running out.
Your front is wearing thin.
So how long can you live like this?
I know this isn't who you really are.
Do you want to break free, 
From all the lies you put in front?
Now take them back.
Do you want to break free?
I don't need a crew, to validate myself.
You're all the same.
Your identity, fading fast.

",Changing Face
Comeback Kid,"You told me I better walk away
Just like to me to never hear what you say
Tempting fate
The story unfolds
Should have seen it
You told me I better walk away
And just like me to never hear what you say
Twisted fate
The story is told
Should have seen it

[Never say never]
Cause you don't know what lies ahead
[better to follow]your heart
Mistakes comes from choices made

Does it mean no damage done?
Not a chance in the world
Cause there was never a day
That went by without regret
[Turn it around]
The past still haunting me
I gotta give, give it away

[Never say never]
Cause you don't know what lies ahead
[Better to follow]your heart
Mistakes comes from choices made
From choices made

I gotta give, I gotta it give [away]
I gotta give, give it away

[I made a choice for me]
[Just one mistake and it's haunting]
[I saw someone never wanted to be]
[The story's told and it's haunting]",Lorelei
Comeback Kid,"[Back again]
Right where I started
And I can't find anything
To take me out of your
Shallow waters
That I've been drowning in so long [so long]
Who's here to take me out
Time to face another day
But will it be just like
The last one
It's up to me
To make the difference this time
I'll face another day
And it won't be just like the last [noo]

You talk loud without words
I've had enough manipulation

I found my way out
I'm not a slave to your game
[I found my way out]

[taking back what's mine]
I will take back",Step Ahead
Comeback Kid,"In an effort to win
I lost it all
At a standstill
How easily it's said

Now eat your words
Everything that I wanted to say
It seemed to die
It all seemed to die on my lips

Another broken heart
Another hit and miss
And when nothing else is easy
How easily it's said

Words so easy to be said
Harder I try harder I fall
Words so easy to be said
Competition it seems so usless
Words so easy to be said
With an ending all to predictable
Words so easy to be said

And once again I've lost it all
",Without a Word
Comeback Kid,"From the start of the day
To the end of the race
We thought we had this all figured out
Without a moment to waste
But we choke, we choke on our words
We waste all of our days
Throw off another year
Living our lives is our greatest fear

From being useless to being used
We lie awake wondering why another year is wasted
Another chance to live passed by us
This on the tip of our tongues
The silence of our lives
But this flame keeps burning
We'll never lay down and die

This isn't hopeless
We'll keep on fighting until the bitter end
This isn't hopeless
We'll carry on

Forget about the boundaries
We'll leave the past behind
With every step we take
We'll finally redefine
We'll carry on

We are the bright lights
Let's not stop shining
This life will always be worth living

From the start of the day
To the end of the race
We thought we had this all figured out
Without a moment to waste
We'll have our way",Bright Lights Keep Shining
Comeback Kid,"Right now I'm feeling useless
It's all the same
It's all the same to me
This curse is growing stronger
This isn't how I thought it would be now
I would pave the way
But I've got nothing to say
Thinking out loud
Who do you want me to be me

We saw, we had a vision
We heard, but didn't listen
I never could accept what they would offer
What they would give

My battle's not against you
I'm fighting with myself
Because I'm pulled in each direction
They're all the same with different names
Falling apart
Fall down fall, falling apart

We can't pretend
That we've ever been safe
Can you hear the sound
Believe

Find your reasons beyond
Feed the urge, take it beyond",Falling Apart
Comeback Kid,"Your time is up!
We've been counting down your days,
Going over every false thing you say.

We wish it could be different.
We wished you stayed the same.
Tearing down our idols--living life our own way.
Taking the chance to say

All my heroes are dead
All my heroes are dead

Were we to blind to see you were only human like me?
But we can't help or feel.
Empty words: they're all you gave.
Struggling to take back our days.

They build you up watch you fall
They build you up watch you fall
Can't you see it can't be what you want
Because I love to watch them fall

Where did we lose control we thought it last forever
Where did we lose control we thought it last forever
We thought it'd last forever
We thought it'd last forever

Were counting down away your days
Our heroes, the ones they use to be
Our idols fall!
Our heroes, the ones they use to be
Our idols fall away!",False Idols Fall
Comeback Kid,"This is my final goodbye
Now I can say it's real
And I can feel the pain
All I do is reason
I want to change things but I don't have a say

Screaming expectations
They've got me by the throat
I'd rather die than bleed
Let's forget those things we said

Can we erase from our minds
The agony of uncertainty in our lives
Well I've seen it come and go
And I've had the time
I've had the time of my life
All this with you

Trying to be strong
And I've seen the time
I've seen the time go so fast
All this with you

This is my final goodbye
My final goodbye

I'd rather die than bleed
Let's forget those things we said
I'd rather die than bleed
The sun has set but still
Here I am, I can't forget 
Here I am, I can't forget",Final Goodbye
Comeback Kid,"I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping it'd all work out
I was losing patience
You know it's never been my best trait
Counting minutes, hours, counting days

Then it dawned on me
Unpredictabilty
I told myself everything's just fine
You worry too much, it's gonna eat you alive

I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping it'd all work out
Will it all work out

Now I feel exposed
Like a black light on the wall in a darkened room
All the dirt appears
You can see my fears
I don't want to let my guard down

You know I never had the feeling
That you would prey on my insecurities
You know I never had the feeling
That you would prey on these insecurities I have

Why is this wait taking so long
Counting minutes, hours, counting days
I'm losing patience

Don't think this means I'm walking away
I won't let fear get the best of me
Now it's up to me
I wouldn't change a thing
(Don't think this means I'm walking away)",Losing Patience
Comeback Kid,"Well that's what I thought
You always finish before we start
Don't have to say a word
Living for these moments

Who's been let down
Who's been dragged down
Been through this so many times before
Eats me inside
Out of this world you know
Trapped inside so many nights alone

I have to know what's inside your heart
Promises have been made
I've been let down
What's inside your heart

We search and we search for
The answers worth fighting for go!
I have to get out, break out
I can't be you

Who's been let down
Who's been dragged down
Been through this so many times before
Eats me inside
Out of this world you know
Trapped inside so many nights alone

Seems now I'm in too deep
And it's never going to be the same
This is me, take it or leave
'cause it's never going to feel the same
I can't be you 
I can't be you",My Other Side
Comeback Kid,"I want to see you here with me
And I want to tell you what you mean to me
But I'll save this, I'll save my breath this time
I think it's almost useless
We both know, we both saw the signs
Still I am asking why

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling inside
So is this story over or has it just begun
You can only wonder and we can only wonder
These days have been too much
I hate being stuck in the in-between

Means to an end
Me taking your hand and moving us ahead
I wish that it could last 'cause I still feel our past
Will we ever feel this way again
Means to and end

Close my eyes and I'll be dreaming away
If things were different I'd be able to say
I'm still here re-thinking my decisions
Our distance, separation
But I'm still here
But I'm still here",Our Distance
Comeback Kid,"I did this to myself
The summer air burning in my lungs
One more glance till I come undone
Let's stop this rising sun

Bright lights can see
They always shine right through me
Leaving me an open book
Of halfways and could-have-beens
Taking us to the end, end, end
And that summer changed us
It's best I admit that to myself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world
It was us against the world

Now it's just me sucking in that summer air
What a summer, I had no care
How quick it all crashed down
Not willing to bend, bend, bend

And these struggles changed us
It's best to admit that to yourself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world
It was us against the world

That morning came too soon
What were we suppose to do
One choice torn in two
I know what you were put through
And I thought we had it
We didn't have enough
We can't go back
We'll never go back now
This is the end",Partners in Crime
