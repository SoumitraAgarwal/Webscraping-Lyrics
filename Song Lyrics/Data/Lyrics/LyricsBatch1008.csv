Markus B.,"Now Keely waits it out
Well she's only young enough for somethings
Healing the sick and dumb
In low on the radar, the smoking gun
We’re moving fast enough to function
Fast enough to function
Maybe it's me 'cause
I seem to think in twos and threes

So find your open door
In through the skin-tight sound
And keep that love underground

Busy scenery
So transfixed on transparent things
An eye for her tiger a bee for her bloom
She crosses her fingers and crosses the room

So catch your salted tears
Before they hit the ground
And keep that love underground",Lovely Day
Markus B.,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are fallin'
To the sound of the breezes that blow
An' I'm trying to please to the callin'
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

One more moon dance with you
In the moon light, on a magic night
All the moon light, on a magic night
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?",Moondance
Markus B.,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight
Markus Pesonen Hendectet,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A  Day In The Life
Markus Schulz,"I don't mind 
Suddenly, you came to life 
You were, astounding 
I was so mesmerized 

Heavenly, is all that, I could feel 
Now your here 
And left without a single feel

And I could run away 
But I would come crawling back 
To face the music once again

Cause you want what I want 
Cause you feel what I feel

Markus Schulz,"Where are things, sometimes late at night 
No one's here but breathing sounds 
Standing small, sleeping on empty dreams 
Move as one, memories 

A blanket of stars can't keep you warm 
When all your love is gone 
And only one heart can argue on 
A river of stars can't wash the pain 
Emotions drown in pain 
For sorrow has no home 

Shadows wave, as you shake your fears 
Nobody's here but clouds and trees 
Question more, absorb the bitter truth 
Move as one, it wont let you be 

A blanket of stars can't keep you warm 
When all your love is gone 
And only one heart can argue on 
A river of stars can't wash the pain 
Emotions drown in pain 
For sorrow has no home 

Love has no 
Love has no home 
Love has no 
Love has no home 
Love has no home 

A blanket of stars can't keep you warm 
When all your love is gone

Emotions drown in pain 
For sorrow has no home 

Love has no home",Sorrow Has No Home
Markus Schulz,"Your speaking a different language to me 
Your world is far away, 
I can never live there 
I'm looking into your eyes, trying to find, a common place to start 
Don't fire that gun yet 

I was turning the page before you could read 
The signs were all around 
But missin' them's easier...

Markus Schulz,"Making promises I can't keep
Do I show, I'm empty
Should I beg for your mercy?
Do you know, I'm glad to be
There's a whole progression

Is this the end of everything?
Do you hear me when I weep?
Cause I search, I search for peace
If I should die within my sleep
So you know, hold me

Nothing but you can taste so sweet
Do I go, are you with me?
Cause you know I'm in too deep
Cause you know, lonely

Markus Stockhausen,"﻿자꾸 눈이 가네 하얀 그 얼굴에
질리지도 않아 넌 왜
슬쩍 웃어줄 땐 나 정말 미치겠네
어쩜 그리 예뻐 babe
뭐랄까 이 기분
널 보면 마음이 저려오네
뻐근하게
오 어떤 단어로
널 설명할 수 있을까
아마 이 세상 말론 모자라
가만 서 있기만 해도
예쁜 그 다리로
내게로 걸어와 안아주는
너는 너는 너
You know he\'s so beautiful
Maybe you will never know
내 품에 숨겨두고 나만 볼래
어린 마음에 하는 말이 아니야
꼭 너랑 결혼할래
오 어떤 단어로
널 설명할 수 있을까
아마 이 세상 말론 모자라
가만 서 있기만 해도
예쁜 그 다리로
내게로 걸어와 안아주는
너는 너는 너
몇 번을 말해줘도 모자라
오직 너만 알고 있는
간지러운 그 목소리로

Marky Mark,"Ah yeah huh..America the Beautiful
Huh, yeah, let me introduce y'all..to the Wildside

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter
Come Prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas swinging nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making fifty to fifty-five thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life..the last for death
Now she's gone, a former Valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams and shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside

Ron had enough of being broke everyday
Saying to himself, there's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make - money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW, a condo, Ron ended up a John Doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk - on the Wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job, a good life, a good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an Ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupted and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect 'til someone was found
Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown
Then there was Bennett, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big check
Blame it on a black man, what the heck?
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is - on the Wildside

Little Tiffany, only thirteen
Came to the city, place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summertime
Sittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far, her vacation was top notch
Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany, and instantly she died
Innocently - on the Wildside",Wildside

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Aladdin's lamp is mine

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You

Marla Hansen,"The wise one sat with me
Her legs crossed left over the right one
She said, ""You know my girl that you're a private creeper
What you need to say you're gonna say alone""

I carried that with me through speeches
And hardly scratched the surface
Ashamed to think that they don't feel as much as I do
She said, ""When I pray for him, I'll pray alone""

Of all the things I never told you
This is the lump in my throat
No matter who had come a-callin'
I would have stayed with you

I forced myself to sit
My hands folded left over the right one
And when it's done my friends
We all walk out together into the waiting cold
I am hollow and bold

We all go out to eat
Because it's what he would have wanted
And I'm so grateful for the ones he brought together
And the stories they tell that we all know so well

But later in my room
I turn the lights out and cover up the mirror
I light a candle for my dear departed teacher
And what I needed to say, now, I can say alone

Of all the things I never told you
This is the lump in my throat
No matter who had come a-callin'
I would have stayed with you

With me

",Frozen Angora
Marlango,"He walks out each morning
He knows where he's going
It will take ten days to get to the desert in the sea
And she'll stay home waiting
And she'll stay home praying
That the sand turned liquid won't take him away

I, I suppose that's normal
I, I suppose that's average
But I, I refuse to think that's life for me

She walks out at night
She knows where she's at
And she'll take her dress off if anyone thinks
She's worths twenty-five or more
That's how it goes

I, I suppose that's normal
I, I suppose that's average
And I, I refuse to think that's life for me

And she'll stay home waiting
And he'll stay home praying
That the streets will bring her back
Safe and sound

I, I suppose that's normal
I, I suppose that's average
But I, I refuse to think that's life for me

",Gran Sol
Marlango,"Whisper whilst I'm
Still waiting in front of the door
I wait for you
Whisper your love and just
Pick up the days I drop along

My life is seeping through my hands
And so
My blisters bleed out love
What holds you is not me
And I'll never close my door

'Cause I want give you every time
What you find
In this mess that I am

Just whisper
Your tiny voice
I know that the stars will shine across your eyes
I want to open you
And find what you're hiding inside
Just whisper
Just whisper
Just whisper

Just whisper
I know that the stars will shine across your eyes
I want to open you
And find what you're hiding inside
Find a way to give myself
Find a way to give myself
Find a way to give all my love to you



",Green on Blue
Marlango,"I suggest you take time from your war
Don't make prisoners, just kill me straight off
You don't even see I don't want to fight
But don't wait for me to strike back

This wound is too big to cover
I'm sure I drown in the void
Of the days you left behind
Of the games you left without rules
Of all of the nights that now pile up
In the space you left behind

And in your absence, my senses
Turn fearful, turn quick
They see everything, anything
Too much, not enough, not enough

And in your absence, my senses
Turn fearful, turn quick
They see everything, anything
Too much, not enough

I suggest you come back to this cemetery
I pile up all the bones you broke in me
Bring a flower and sweep all the ashes
Take the frames that still hang from the wall

And in your absence, my senses
Turn fearful, turn quick
They see everything, anything
Too much, not enough
No, not enough, not enough

Do your little dance for me

Madness is the game
I will play with you

Madness is the kiss I'll give to you
Wrapped in silver night

Till you loose my trace

Till you lose yourself

I take too long to think
How I'm gonna take the first step

Maybe, I'm so exhausted

Trying to go out the door and doing my best
My best to grab your arms

Swing you around and make you mine
For once my love I'll take the beginning
With no end in mind, for once, my love
I'll take the beginning with no end in mind

Maybe, I wait outside the door
Maybe, you stand behind the window
Trying to hide
Maybe, your eyes are full of lies

Maybe, my mouth is fast with lines
That I wish didn't work
But I'll try my best and I guess

I'll swing you around and make you mine
For once my love I'll take the beginning
With no end in mind, for once, my love
I'll take the beginning with no end in mind

Maybe I'm scared because
I think I'm too slow to bring out
All the sparks that burn inside
Maybe I'm small because

I think I'm too weak to take up
All the space that I request
But I'll try my best

I'll swing you around and make you mine

My love is tough when he cries

My love's hands are soft and strong

I am as small as a snail
I am as soft as a drop
I am lost and crawl
But I'll climb only up to you

I am angry as thunder
I am strong as blood
I am as cloudy and clear as all the skies
That pass through your eyes

We'll be as happy as children
We'll be as jumpy as queens
We'll fight and fuss for hours
Only to rest in each other's arms

Marlango,"My mind wonders with no map
I have no route no point I daydream
My mind wonders with no map
And real life colours seem washed out
My eyes see things of a secret nature
I resist from trying to understand
I tear the pages of my past

To recall what you think you thought you wanted
Every yesterday is empty
And no tomorrow will hold
What you carry with yourself today
I carry with myself today
No route, no point, no map

My eyes see things of a secret nature
And I think if I find a word
I will unlock the past
As if a morning
Could wake up some side of me
That's plain and rich full and lovely and hidden
Plain and full of colours
'Cause I have all the words in me
Words I've never heard before
I try to pick up what sleeps
I try to pick up what slips through your mouth
And find that my own words are so dull and empty
I desist, I quit, I don't know
Answers to questions you
You make, you wait



",Nico
Marlango,"Doctor says it's all fine, vertigo is all fine
When you're sitting on top of your childhood dreams
'Cause who wouldn't be scared at the top of the stair
Who wouldn't stare before they dare

But there's no use 'cause I can't find you
But there's no use 'cause I can't find you
But there's no use at all

Doctor says it's all right, feeling shit when it's all light
When luck hits you like a truck, I keep on walking in the street with luck
And climb over your arms and step onto your charms
And tread over the dreams I had one night.

But there's no use 'cause I can't find you
But there's no use 'cause I can't find you
But there's no use at all

'Cause who wouldn't be scared at the top of the stair

Marlango,"Once upon a time I was with you
In a castle built with dreams we had each night
All the walls were water where the moon would dance
And the floor moved every time we touched

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near, anyone's near

When you left I tried
To drown that moon each night
And the water turned to ice
That locked me up inside

But there's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near, anyone's near

Now, I found a planet for myself
Where an ocean cares for me
We beat like wounds

And there is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near

There is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near, everyone near

And there is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near

There is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near, everyone's near
",Once Upon a Time
Marlango,"I used to think one day I'd learn the truth about life
Nailed everything I saw to the wall of certainties
Then life came along and casually pulled down
My house

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood
Then I believed everything I touched
Was a lie impossible to live up to
Pull down brick by brick
The fence around my life
Burnt the flowers ´cos I thought
I thought they were alibis

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood

Now I observe constructions around me
The architecture of sophisticated lives
Warehouses to pile up mistakes
Woodsheds to hide the dreams we give up on

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood
I used to think one day I'd get to be something
Now there's nothing that I wanna be
There's nothing I can be 'cause I'm nothing
There's nothing I can be, not worth trying",Architecture of Lies

But no matter how far I go, no matter
I still catch myself

In me I can invent a new landscape
I've got trains advancing through my veins
I build stations and playgrounds for my mind to wander out
The nicotine and games I can invent all over again

Marlena Shaw,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do

Another empty promise
Washed away
Without at least a warning
Scars remain
They whisper of your story
And now you're breaking

But the storm can never keep you down
If you hold on - you can overcome it now
On your knees is where it turns around
Cause a shell must break before a bird can fly
You can reach the sky

When the wind is blowing hard against you,
You can stand like the highest tower
Please believe you may not know the reason
But it will make you stronger

First you gotta hit your knees
Second thing is ask him please

Marlene Dietrich,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

In the meadow cows are sleepin'
And the speckled trout stop leapin' up stream

You can hear the grass as it grows.

Marlene VerPlanck,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Marley Marl,"Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad 

My rhymes start to flow  so I simply must brag 

About my style that makes you vibrant  I keep drivin 

Until the song turns me to a hip hop giant 

Me and Marley Marl  we're goin one on one 

For any sucker rapper that chooses to come 

And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin 

I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing? 

They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip 

Suckers just have to flip cause I'm so hip 

Craig G and Marley Marl, we form the ultimate alliance 

No sucker can deal when I'm droppin science

Rappers: Ask yourself the same question 

Why am I best in this profession? 

Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo 

Or the things Marley does in the studio? 

I drop science as if I was Butterfingers 

And I know there's not another singer 

In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme 

Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine 

And when it comes to havin showmanship 

I really don't care who you go and get 

Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant 

And I can get stupid just by droppin science

Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire 

For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare 

These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit 

And sized perfectly, so that they can fit 

You're steppin to us? You need traction 

Or you'll be another sucker missin in action 

You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it

You're jealous of the crew, that's why you're starin, right?
Forget the answer, the situation's obvious
When this is over, let's see who feels the sorriest

And not one of us can you handle
On the mic Magic, on the tables Marley
And when it comes to bein dope, don't ask: are we?
'cause our style is different, or should I say irregular?
And if you want to get all hype, I'll have to settle ya
By pullin out my 12-gauge shotgun
And if you want to go rhyme for rhyme, I got some
Dope rhymes for sure, or should I say galore?
But I won't sound old-schoolish, in other words foolish
I have a question now: who feels hurt?

Oops - I mean Marley, cause Hurb's a beat-biter
I don't know where the both of you get the right to
Come in the industry, steal someone's property
And some of you, forbid, start clocking's
Now that's not fair, Marley's the rightful owner
Yet you still treat him like he's a blood-doner

(Yo man, was that a tape?!) Nah, never in a milion years
You see, the liveness gives us the feelin we're
Bein accepted as true entertainers
And it will stay that way for the remainder
Of the century, that's how it's meant to be

When I made arrest the president  America ate me 

Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me 

They labeled me a prejudice poet 

I'm speaking the truth as I know it 

I hold on but it's hard for me to handle 

Too much lies  corruption and scandal 

Cops want to kill a brother or two 

Who do you call when the gang wears blue 

I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man 

My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger 

I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer 

Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor 

Mali troops will run through your resident 

In my hand will be the head of your president

Will rise up for a political showdown

Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip 

Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip 

Of the ropes and chains that kept us 

Since we were black they didn't want to except us 

But it's ok, I got my own plan 

'Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program

Since they kept him locked up for so long

And let the red, black and green show 

Become aware of yourself before it gets too late

Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids 

And the man caught a nice thick bitch 

Now the bitch is on skid 

Screaming how she hates her kids 

The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip

Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon

On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me

You disagree, it's still reality - see

Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????

So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize

Think you're sayin somethin, you ain't sayin jack
Now tell me, what is goin on these days?
From what I'm seein lately I'd say crime pays
Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
state on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack
When you're layin on the ground with a hole in your back

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm here to bust your shit
The mastermind of manuscripts
The force of extremity
My rhymes are the remedy
You can't deal with the T-are-a-g
Rap ??? flowin like the Pegasus
Rhymin is as easily as the obvious
I bust your head pulsating rotating
This jam is generating with the motion I'm creating
I'm the boy wonder, Tragic super duper
Raised in the Bridge, cause I'm a Queensbridge trooper
The rebel of the treble, the ebony prince
'88 is on the way, I make a big difference
I make it visual and intellectually clear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[ VERSE 2 ]
Because I master great kicks turnin flesh to dust
And knockin all boots is a definite must
Cause I'm havoc, Trag, Tragedy tragic
There are many ways to explain my magic
The explanatory category best fits me
Cause my lyrics are called sweet poetry
And I'm sick of be	-boys just hippin and hoppin it
I have you sayin, ""Damn boy, shorty be droppin it""
Back in the '60s to know is to know it
And I'm the last remaining of the world's last poets
Talkologist, infinity from when I begin
And to disapprove the Trag is a mortal sin
Diabolical gangster, hoodlum and genius
I write poetry when I find it convenient
Snap a stage in half like a polo bear
(Your Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[ VERSE 3 ]
I drop words you won't find in a dictionary
I write rhymes to improve my vocabulary
Drama, Art, English education
And I'm the man, I design the animation
Mentally and with jock control
The equalizer rises up on your FM mode
And which I use with telepath
And it's (Tragedy) who's on your phonograph
I confuse your conscience, and boggle your brain
You may think that I'm sick, but I'm perfectly sane
I design my rhymes with architectural construction
But that's another story, a different function
You see, it's mandatory to embold fear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[ VERSE 4 ]
The rap automatical, the rhymatical
Forget ill, I get illmatical
Biceps pulsating in my lungs
Queensbridge Projects is where I'm from
Wicked like a witch doin sorcery
With a book and a pen, and my m-i-see
The outstanding ovation when things get drastic
You keep fantasizin while I'm fantastic
Black magic flowin smooth but strong
And I'll have you rockin and shockin...

Marley Marl,"(Let's play a little game)
(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
(Aw - there it is!)

(I've waited long enough)
Bust a move, let's play a little Simon Says
So take your places and listen to the rhymin as
I like display a new style that just may
Leave suckers runnin for the door in total dismay
Yeah, by now, so you're startin to
Get a little hype, but first get a partner
And proceed full speed right to the dance arena
I really doubt it, but maybe by chance you seen 
another brother more inclined to play the part of Simon
Than the Master Ace who knows the art of rhymin
Like a shark knows the finer points of swimmin
Like Steady Pace know the cuts and the fly women
And so before we start this game
Simon says: get up, and yo, I do the same

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: look deep into your partner's eyes
(Let's play a little game)
Look at your partner from head to toe
(Let's play a little game)
And all those good parts in between, you know
(Let's play a little game)

Simon says: it gets badder, and you never had a
Beat that can heat your feet, and still add a
Theme with so much steam, it makes sweat pour
From your faces, and the Ace is sure
Gonna do it, as you listen to it
See, I navigate ya straight to help through it
I'm Simon, rhymin, climbin on time, and
On a mission, that's the position that I'm in
Takin you there, makin you care
I'm achin to tear up the floor, but I don't dare
Leave the mic sittin, gettin cold without my hand on
Those that dance don't have a foot to stand on
And those that don't dance, yo, you oughta know
Simon says: wall flowers aren't allowed to grow

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: close your eyes
And imagine your partner totally unclothed
(Let's play a little game)
Nude, in the butt, bare to the flesh
Now get as close as you can to your partner
And without touching him, move your body to the rhythm
(Let's play a little game)

Simon takes the stand, just as planned
And I display in a ray that's rather grand
Now I agree, there are many who said 'party's off'
But if one of them says, he drops arty soft
See to drop hard you must have the kind of mind
That's refined and artistically lined
Cause yo, it takes nack if you want to attack
Attract with such skill, and still fit the bill
Ace and Action, few can come harder
Than we come, uhm - here's some, but only part of
The gift that can lift the myth that is swift
Only boast the most, yo, Simon says
If your partner's face is in place with your taste
Then haste, you better push up, no time to waste
So if you're with it, you better get it, don't try to sit it
On a chair and stare like a square, brother, quit it
There's no time for nerds and geeks, only freaks
With the sexy cheeks, as the Master speaks
And for weeks and weeks you will dance and prance
To the rhythm I enhance with my chants
So here's a glance at a jam that'll nullify
And fry all the rest, bust the color
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in the gold and violet
This jam is fly, and I'm the pilot
Flyin you straight to the end of the rainbow
Steady and I try to open your brain, so
You can accept what was carefully kept
Till the fun stops, then the party was pepped
Up, and if you stepped up, you couldn't hold your place in a chair
So hail Simon, the brother Master Ace in the rear

Simon says: yeah
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: put your right hand on your partner's shoulder
And put your left hand on your partner's waist
(Let's play a little game)
Now move your hips rhythmatically
(Let's play a little game)
Now the climax
Simon says: touch your partner's body
Touch your partner's body
In every way imaginable
Yeah
Do the nasty
(Let's play a little game)
I want to say what's up to my DJ Steady Pace
Sha-Born the technician
Ray for real
Eye-see you Rock and the rest of the Action Posse
Special thanks to DJ Marley Marl
And Tim Westwood rockin things out in U.K.
(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
Peace, world

Marley's Ghost,"­With my two hands on the plow, I don't mind my journey now.
Keep your hands on the plow, hold on.
Mary wore three links of chain, every link was Jesus' name.

Marley's Ghost,"They are!
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Twas grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.",Amazing Grace
Marley's Ghost,"My life flows on in endless song
Above Earth's lamentation
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear that music ringing
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?
What though the tempest loudly roars
I know the truth, it liveth
What though the darkness 'round me close
Songs in the night it giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is Lord of Heaven and Earth
How can I keep from singing?
When tyrants tremble, sick with fear
And hear their death knells ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?
In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singing",How Can I Keep from Singing
Marley's Ghost,"(Chorus:)
I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land.
I've got a home in that yonder city, Good Lord,
And it's not, (oh no it's not) not made by hand.
I've got a mother, sister, and a brother
Who have gone this way before.
I am determined to go and see them, Good Lord,
Over on that other shore.
(Chorus)
I'm going down to the river of Jordan,
Just to bathe my weary soul.
If I touch but the hem of his garment, Good Lord,
I believe it would make me whole.
(Chorus)",I Am a Pilgrim
Marley's Ghost,"Half a mile from the county fair
And the rain came pourin' down
Me and Billy standin' there
With a silver half a crown

Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

Then the rain let up and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned

And he dropped us up the road
Yeah, we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes

Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me",Pass Me Not
Marley's Ghost,"Well, I'm tired and I'm weary, but I must roll along
'Til the Lord comes to call me away
Where the morning is bright, and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as fair as the day

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, Oh, Lord, I pray!
There will be no sorrow, no sadness, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb
And the beasts of the wild will be led by a child
And I'll be changed from this creature, Lord, I am

Marley's Ghost,"By the rivers of Babylon,
Where he sat down,
And there he went
For he remembered Zion.
For the wicked carry us away.
Captivity requireth from us a song.
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
So let the words of our mouth
And the meditations of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight over I.",Rivers of Babylon
Marley's Ghost,"Sinner man, so discouraged
While travelling through this land, this land.
Oh, Lord, this land.
Come, let us have a little talk with Jesus
Just to hear what He has to say.
(Chorus:)
My God Almighty spoke and He said,
""Go! And I'll go with you.
Open your mouth and I will speak for you.""
For the Lord, tell me what to say,
They won't believe on me.
I would not be a sinner,
Tell you the reason why:
'Fraid the Lord might call me
And I wouldn't be ready to die.

Some say give me silver.
Some say give me gold.
I say, ""Give me Jesus!
For He's precious to my soul.""

Marley's Ghost,"(Chorus:)
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure, sweet love.
A sign from above on the wings of a dove.
When troubles surround us, when evils come,
the body grows weak, the spirit grows numb.
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us,
He sends down His love on the wings of a dove.
(Chorus:)
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days,
he searched for land in various ways.
Troubles, he had some, but wasn't forgotten,
He sent him His love on the wings of a dove.

If I was a preaching man, I tell you what I'd do:

If I was a carpenter I tell you what I'd do:

If I was a ramblin' man, I tell you what I'd do:
I'd stop my rambling, stop my gambling,

When we grow up, will I be pretty?

Will you be big and strong?

Will I wear dresses that show off my knees?

Will you wear trousers twice as long?

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


Hey!

When we grow up, will I be a lady?

Will you be an engineer?

Will I have to wear things like perfume and gloves?

I can still pull the whistle while you steer.

Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.

And I don't care if you never get tall.

I like what I look like, and you're nice small.

We don't have to change at all.


When I grow up, I'm gonna be happy and do what I like to do,

Like making noise and making faces and making friends like you.

And when we grow up, do you think we'll see

That I'm still like you and you're still like me?

I might be pretty; you might grow tall.

But we don't have to change at all.


Spoken: I don't want to change, see, 'cause I still want to be your friend, forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

He wanted a doll, to hug and hold
""A doll,"" said William, ""is what I need
To wash and clean, and dress and feed

""A Doll to give a bottle to
And put to bed when day is through
And any time my doll gets ill
I'll take good care of it,"" said my friend Bill

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
Don't be a sissy said his best friend Ed
Why should a boy want to play with a doll
Dolls are for girls said his cousin Fred
Don't be a jerk, said his older brother
""I know what to do,"" said his father to his mother

So his father bought him a basketball
A badminton set, and that's not all
A bag of marbles, a baseball glove
And all the things a boy would love

And Bill was good at every game
Enjoyed them all, but all the same
When Billy's father praised his skill
""Can I please have a doll now,"" said my friend Bill

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
A doll, a doll, William wants a doll

Then William's grandma arrived one day
And wanted to know what he liked to play
And Bill said, ""Baseball's my favorite game
I like to play, but all the same

""I'd give my bat and ball and glove
To have a doll that I could love""
""How very wise,"" his grandma said
Said Bill, ""but everyone says this instead""

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
A doll, a doll, William wants a doll

So William's grandma, as I've been told
Bought William a doll, to hug and hold
And William's father began to frown
But grandma smiled, and calmed him down

Explaining, William wants a doll
So when he has a baby someday
He'll know how to dress it, put diapers on double
And gently caress it to bring up a bubble
And care for his baby as every good father
Should learn to do

Marlon Roudette,"If love was a word, I don't understand.
The simplest sound, With four letters.
Whatever it was, I'm over it now.
With every day, It gets better.

Are you loving pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.

I'm walking away, From everything I had.
I need a room with new colours.
There was a time,
When I didn't mind living the life of others.

Are you loving pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.

So much fire that it burned my wings.
Her heat was amazing.
Now I'm dreaming of the simple things.
Old ways, erased.
If love was a word,
I don't understand.
The simplest sound,
With four letters.

Are you loving pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.

Marlon Roudette,"Gimme the tune and ?
Even if it don't mean the same
But every time I'll sing for you
But every time I'll sing for you
Will see you bought and sold, and sold, riding home
I don't know ? ain't no home...

Wait, the same little boy with the cassette tape?
The big foot jeans, awaiting at the school gate
Late night thoughts, he's tearing up the paper
And here's the soundbite ten years later
He took the yard to the city an he mixed it
Mattafixed it, now he's on some sick shhh
So keep your money and your cars and your deals
I'm riding home on the same two wheels

Gimme the tune and ?
Even if it don't mean the same
But every time I'll sing for you
But every time I'll sing for you

Gimme the tune and ?
Even if it don't mean the same
But every time I'll sing for you
But every time I'll sing for you

Wait the same little boy they used to underestimate?
Made a great escape with only practice
An attic and a mattress
This same man is trying to hatch this game plan
And catch a vibe make it world wide
Spirals of idols and rivals labelled as a dreamer
Stroll as the world rolls by you in a beamer
Now empathize if you know how it feels
Riding home on the same two wheels
I made my best friends
From the West Indies to the West End
In every corner in every section
Perfection, long lasting connection
The little boy with the clear skin complexion
Afternoons and I'm scrubbing old sneakers
In time to the vibes from my makeshift speakers
An assortment laments from my Walkman
I'm still trying to walk good though
I'm slightly awkward

Gimme the tune and ?
Even if it don't mean the same
But every time I'll sing for you
But every time I'll sing for you
Will see you bought and sold, and sold, riding home

So, things didn't work out exactly how I planned it
No matter how you brand it I'm still the same bandit

Essentially the story of the 21st century
Kid make your music cause it's meant to be
Music cause it's meant to be
I'm making music cause it's meant to be
You never know what it meant to me
Now if you're bought and sold, and sold you're riding home",Riding Home

Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

Why can't we make it everlasting

It will leave no heart undone

I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

Maroon 5,"How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Weaving figure eights and circles around your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for

Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around

I'm making your love

Don't think I know how to go slow

Calm these jets

You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when i hear your name
Think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say

Remember how my body tastes

Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun.""

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away

Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be

And we're only several miles from the sun.""

The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind

And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I

Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack

The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given when I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two
Do you

When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...

Another year over
And a new one just begun

And so this is Christmas

Maroon 5,"From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same

Like the taste of the day you left
It still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
The stain where you had wept

All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Three more days till I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up

If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Now, every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say
""He's just wasting your love and time.""
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

No need to cry about it

And I can't stop thinking about you
You never go on till I do

Time slows down; I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways

I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

It would fall down while I'm asleep

And now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table,
And say you never look back
Your super stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad

Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,

Maroon 5,"Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn't pass right by you

Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe your plain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it's just not there

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)

Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be

Now her face is something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)

I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeah

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home

Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation
You're naked in daylight

It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
I don't need you tonight

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, your love's not real

Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen

Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth

Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true

I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one

Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?

And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
I'd kill if I could take you back

Don't patronize me with lies

Wondering if I really tried everything I could

That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

And sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty

It's not that I love someone else

I'm sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax
You know you want me

All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there

And the emptiness is too much to bear

Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all

It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

When you drown me in questions

Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying oohoo
And I thought I heard you call my name yeah yay yay
And I thought I heard you out there crying
No, just the same oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying oohoo
And I thought I heard you call my name oohoo
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playin' the cuts

I'm dancin' with a nice honey
And her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shakin' it up, shakin' it up

Mami don't break it
Takin' it down, taking it down
I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me

Doing what you're doing

(That your eyes shine like pearls)
Has anybody ever told you
(That your one special girl)
Has anybody ever showed you
(That love is here to stay)
Cause you stole my heart on this very day and I can't let you walk away

[Verse 2:]
It took me by surprise lit up my eyes like a child with a brand new toy 
I never had so much inspiration now my songs are filled with joy
I can feel my soul and I can feel my heart beatin for the very first time
No I'm not your mans but I'm makin plans like you're already mine

[Chorus]
Has anybody ever told you 
(That your eyes shine like pearls)
Has anybody ever told you
(That your one special girl)
Has anybody ever showed you
(That love is here to stay)
Cause you stole my heart on this very day Can't let you walk away

[Bridge]
Walk away can't let you walk away from me 
Gotta keep you here's something I want to tell you 
Tell you in your ear baby is it to clear that I...Want You 

[Chorus]
Has anybody ever told you 
(That your eyes shine like pearls)
Has anybody ever told you
(That your one special girl)
Has anybody ever showed you
(That love is here to stay)
Cause you stole my heart on this very day Can't let you walk away",Walk Away
Marques Houston,"She's complicated 
It so frustrating 
Sometimes I think 
This girl is crazy 

Can't explain it 
Finest thing 
Screams my name 
I can't let her go 

First we kiss, then we fight 
Its off the chain, every night 
Shorty knows what I like 
And I can't get it off my mind 

Sometimes it good 
Sometimes it bad 
She treats me so damn bad 
She's still the best I ever had 
That's why she got me

[Chorus: x2]
She got me actin' up (got me actin' up) 
She got me actin' up (got me actin' up) 
The way she backs it up (the way she backs it) 
Can't stop actin' up

Intoxicated 
Gotta love her 
I be stressed 
I'm such a mess 

Thanks to you 
Makes no sense at all 
In the morning 
In the evening 

Sweating you 
'Cause I believe 
What you give 
From head to toe 

Girl me and you 
Girl lets get it on 
Sometimes it good 
Sometimes it bad 

She treats me so damn bad

Shorty tried to tell me 'chill', but I wasn't listenin'
I can't deny, you knew me from bein' immature
Homeboy was sayin' 'sorry', take you to the country store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom, you was there to pick me up
I neglected you but then we'd hug and we'd kiss it up
But you never do nuttin' up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace
But now I see I'll neva find another like you
You the type boo, make a playa want to wife you
But me and you, this money's not a issue
When I miss you, when I touch you, I can feel it in my bones
I'm still wit you and I'm sorry 'bout the way I did you

(All because of you) ooh, you're the love of my life
And I was doin' (ooh) wrong but I want to do right girl

I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready

When you talked about our future
You would nod your head and smile
But I didn't understand it, I was living in denial
I couldn't see the picture, didn't wanna see it clearer
'Cause I was so young
And now that I can't get ya, wanted to be wit' ya
What have I become?

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Mamma told me 'bout excuses
She'd say, ""They're no use to say""
What you would have done but didn't
I had to learn the hard way
Now that it's over, I wanted to just hold you
But I know I can't
I'm tryna be a soldier, I wanna do it over
Give me one more chance, I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Can I get a redo, baby?
'Cause you know I need you, baby
And now I'm ready for your love, your love

I just wanna see you, baby
Just wanna smell and breathe you, baby
'Cause I hate what we've become
I wasn't ready for love

I waited, I contemplated and then I did it
It was room for relationship, but pretty had to hit it
We like hand and glove, head to a yankee fitted
Game is obsolete, it's all how you spit it
Better yet listen 'cause karma's a true avenger
Sort of like a Ninja or a king in all his splendor
Remember, love can be as cold as December
Unless it's in its truest form, I could never injure

Your heart, break you or make you see my vision
'Cause I know eventually you'll see my vision
By the way I'm livin' and it's a given
I'm giving you my heart, I'm giving you my soul
I'm giving you my gold

I'm sorry for the dirt that I did
Sneaking broads in and out the crib
The double life that I lived
They say a fool sells dreams
But a man makes dreams come true
Mami, I changed all for the love of you
I wasn't ready back then though

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause

This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
I'm loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me 
We ain't close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you don't let it go go go go

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 3(Shawnna)
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, that's it
And I really can't leave right now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I don't really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And I fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow
Don't know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Wht you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holding back on me

Outro(Shawnna)

Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
Wutsup wutsup 
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Telling me to take control

And I can hardly breathe, 'cause I still can't believe
Lay your hand on my chest, gently lifting your knees.. slowly started grinding

Your tears got your eyeliner running down your face
You're so sexy I can feel your body shake

And the light is low
I got frequent flyer mileage

Come on you ready?

To explore is the key

I was the man that had your heart

Said that I should never trust you

I let myself go fall in love with you

You were supposed to be my future
Brought the ring and had to take it right back

You could get a me (yeah)

More precious than the rarest diamond or pearl
And even though we didn't work out together
You're still my sunset-set-set-set
And I know that you and I are two worlds apart
But you'll always be the one to have my heart
I'm gonna love you for now and forever
'Cause you're my sunset-set-set-set-set

Your innocent smile used to drive me wild
Even though you ain't innocent at all
And now I feel so stupid cause I'm the only man
That ever loved you even with all your flaws
Even your best friend questioned why
I still would be with you after knowing your past
But what she didn't understand is knowing your past is why I thought we could last

(What happened to us)
We had something special but
What? Was I not good enough for you
(Are you really in love)
Can't show mine was fine
Cause without trying I still ended up hurting you (and I'm sorry)

You're more beautiful than anything in this world
More precious than the rarest diamond or pearl
And even though we didn't work out together
You're still my sunset-set-set-set
And I know that you and I are two worlds apart
But you'll always be the one to have my heart
I'm gonna love you baby now and forever
'Cause you're my sunset-set-set-set-set

Maybe one day we'll end up talking again
Maybe one day we'll go back to being just friends
Promise to love you baby till my life ends
'Cause you're my sunset-set-set-set-set

No matter what happened between me and you
I'll always be the man that you could run to

Desde el cielo habló luna llena
Pero a cambio quiero

Poco le iba a creer

Que te haga mujer

Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel

De padre canela nació un niño
Blanco como el lomo de un armiño
Con los ojos grises
En vez de aceituna
Niño albino de luna
Maldita su estampa
Este hijo es de un payo
Y yo no me lo cayo

Gitano al creerse deshonrado
Se fue a su mujer cuchillo en mano
¿De quién es el hijo?
Me has engañao fijo
Y de muerte la hirió
Luego se hizo al monte
Con el niño en brazos
Y allí le abandonó

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Di una hit, di una suite a Copacabana
Di un DJ, più di un rave in mezzo alla Savana
Più del successo, più di fare sesso ad alta quota
Più di ogni banconota, più della coca
Più dei gioielli ed orologi, anelli che ho alle dita
Più di questa libertà, più della stessa vita

Sono infelice di professione
Sogno che sono morto, il mio corpo in strada, la processione
Tra bur buono e Burbuka
Imbazzato, fumo un bazooka
Non faccio scena ma scena muta
Farfalle nello stomaco, dammi l’insetticida
Voglio ridisegnare il mondo, dammi una matita
Voglio ridere come non avessi mai pianto
Voglio la luna e camminarci sopra come Armstrong
L’abbiamo fatto ed ero innamorato, finalmente
Ma il giorno dopo già non provavo più niente
Portami sulle onde dell’oceano quando si alzano
Uccidimi e fammi risorgere come con Lazzaro
Dammi tutto allo stato puro
Di più di un vestito scuro
Di un roseo futuro
Non mi ammazzerà una sbronza ma il primo bicchiere sicuro
Fammi provare di più che contare il cash
Di più di un menage à tre Dammi!

Questo mondo fa troppo chiasso
Io non sento più quello che penso
Quello che è peggio non ricordo più quello che ho perso
In un paese dove onesto rima con modesto
Tutto è piatto e tu ti sorprendi se io ci stendo
Fuori carri e carnevali, dentro carri armati
I miei amici vaporizzati, gialli a Nagasaki
Ridotto a esprimermi in 24 carati
Stati d’animo in centoquaranta caratteri
E non so chi tu pensi io sia
La realtà non è all’altezza della fantasia
Certe idee che mi accarezzano e che scaccio via
Un brivido che faccia breccia nella mia apatia
Non sei più mia e ti trovo male
Il tuo nuovo ragazzo ti invecchia
Ma resti bella e triste come il paesaggio a Venezia
E non avrò paura se saremo insieme
Una morte dolce, come una mosca che affoga nel miele

Più dei gioielli ed orologi, anelli che ho alle dita
Più di questa libertà, più della stessa vita.

Voglio un brivido, vuoi emozioni soltanto a metà
sono in bilico, su una lama che mi taglierà
ed è ripido, corro e non mi volto indietro fra

L’asfalto palestra
Come un Dōjō le gescal
Qui che doso la mesca
Siamo ombre sui tetti
Di un Impero finito
Sono solo interessi
Non c’è amico o nemico
No valori, non più
Noi Rōnin senza Shōgun
Con la M di money in fronte come Majin Bu
Il disprezzo è in eterno
Il mio polso è più fermo
Giro lame all’interno
Organi di ogni governo
Senza fare rumori sveglio la verità
Ho una lista di nomi come Arya Stark
Da come rispondi già prevedo dei guai
Tu da come li conti io so già come li fai
Fango per questi schiavi
E sangue per chi fa il bandito
Ciò che sporca le mani rende il lavoro pulito
Sbuffo, soffio del drago
Grosso guaio a Milano
Ora sai cosa siamo
Mostrami ciò che hai imparato

Ehi brada
Sarò la tua via e la tua spada
Come la tua ombra in strada
Tu sei nel mio clan, clan, clan
Clan, clan, clan
Oh Mama
Ora che ti sei addestrata
Pronta per il “brr-ratatata”
Lotta per il clan, clan, clan
Siam, siam, siam
Ninja, Ninja, Ninja
Ninja, Ninja, Ninja
Ninja, Ninja, Ninja
Ninja, Ninja, Ninja

G.U.È

Siamo nati per far sempre l’alba
Per non trovare calma
La vita vera è farla, no parla parla
Io fumo denso nel silenzio
Io mi muovo svelto
Se non alzi il mento vai sul pavimento
E poi sarai scomparso in gabbia
Con due sacchi di sabbia
Tu confida in me
Come Don Pablo con La Quica
E il mondo dei grandi
La strada si tinge, è scarlatta
Non c’è pace, non c’è Mahatma Gandhi
Siamo affiliati nella stessa family
Se si scaldano gli animi siamo affilati
La mia tecnica è shinobi
Rima poetica, cammino al buio
Il cuore avvolto dai rovi
E qua non accettiamo tradimenti, se stai con me non menti
Controllo gli elementi
La terra, sotto i piedi se ti manca
Il fuoco se hai freddo nella stanza
L’acqua, se avrai sete e questa aria

Marracash,"Mai stato in prigione, sono le stesse le sensazioni
Camera mia con pareti più spesse e sai da soli
Camminano in pochi, cattivi modi
Come stampelle, come bretelle per i pantaloni
E fugge e corre, il mondo gira e corre sul posto
Se perdi muori ma ben prima di essere morto
Vigliaccheria: piega i più duri che conosco
Non è la via, sono i tamburi dello scontro
E ogni tanto per capirlo serve uno schiaffo
Come in amore: lo capisci quando ti lascio
Nessun rimpianto, i rancori restano anche quando dormi
Come le unghie che crescono dopo che muori
E i creditori in conto aperto non accettano buone intenzioni
Non ti rispettano se ti vergogni
E non c'è questo nei libri che ho letto
La fuori la vita non impartisce ma infligge lezioni

La mia prigione è nella mente
Sei tra la gente in isolamento
È solamente un brutto momento
Ridere e piangere di cuore, essere un bravo attore
Volare oltre la coltre di chi è mediocre

La mia prigione è nella mente
Sei tra la gente in isolamento
È solamente un brutto momento
Ridere e piangere di cuore, essere un bravo attore
Il tempo è fermo di notte
È la mia prigione

Seduti in circolo, appoggiati al muro, a turno
I miei fra' tossiscono, si guardano e ridono per un nulla
Anime perse
Le mani fredde, braccia conserte
Invertono le sillabe se passa gente
Sapere tutto, sapere niente
A volte è solo un dare un nome a cose che già hai dentro
E tra le tempie è il mio tempio, è la mia prigione
Su questo tempo dare l'esempio è la mia cauzione
E se è nella mente la tua prigione
Pensa attentamente: la libertà è una decisione
Non sempre scrivo consapevole, lo so
Però non sempre vivo consapevole
Non ho ragione?!
E proporzione non c'è tra quanto è grosso e quanto vale
Tra la ferita e quanto fa male
Chi è ""normale"" è il dubbio, no male
Chiuso in una vita non male, non vale

La mia prigione è nella mente
Sei tra la gente in isolamento
È solamente un brutto momento
Ridere e piangere di cuore, essere un bravo attore

Metti un po' di trucco in faccia che crea novità
Gli ho risposto sono vero e serio
Ecco la novità e in più sono un mezzo genio, ma nessuno lo sa
È OK me ne resto tranquillo con lei
Ma mettimi T.I. e leva i Coldplay
O potrei sfasciare tutto come Kobain
E lasciare tutti di stucco come a Pompei
Il principe di Barona e non di Bel Air
In sella ad un elefante come a Bombay
Mi senti fra' quando arrivo io in città

Marracash,"Quando rubarono il camion a mio padre ci rimasi male
Ce l'ho impresso, non l'avevo mai visto depresso
Stavamo in centro, casa di ringhiera, piena di immigrati
Senza i sanitari, uscivo per andare al cesso
Per un po' restò disoccupato
Stava al bar sotto casa coi Campari a tenersi occupato
Faceva briscole coi paesani
Con gli occhi rossi per il fumo e gli amari
Io ero alle elementari
Ed ero in classe coi bimbi fortunati
Coi dindi nei salvadanai e i genitori educati
E io, fra', stavo coi figli d'immigrati, coi figli di operai
Mi vergognavo, i miei erano ignoranti
Mi vergognavo del dialetto
E mi prendevo con gli altri al parchetto
Se le prendevo, lui mi dava il resto
A darmele era sempre mia madre
Io fingevo, ma in realtà, a quell'età, ormai già non mi faceva male

Nessuno pagava un cazzo nel mio palazzo, e ci arrivò lo sfratto
E su mia madre ebbe un brutto impatto
Era venuta a Milano sognando una casa privata
E ora stava alla Barona, dietro una risaia
E io diventai grande in un lampo
Perché alle medie volavano sedie
E le bestemmie coi pugni sul banco
E ognuno si prendeva ciò che non aveva
L'aria tesa per due sguardi
Il pretesto, la scusa: ""c'hai moneta?""
No, e poi facevi a pugni
Scappare è da conigli
Le sigarette, biciclette, motorini
Poi la sera coi più grandi ascoltavamo le imprese dei miti
E imparavamo ad odiare gli sbirri
E nel quartiere non hai niente, ma hai i veri amici
Non possedere ti rallenta, ma puoi riuscirci
Ed ogni anno andavo sempre in ferie giù in Sicilia
In uno diesel, solo allora rivedevo mio padre felice

Erano gli anni '90, Milano era un'altra
Lì ho capito già che i miei non ce l'avevano fatta
E la scuola era una pacchia, iscritto all'ITIS
Eravamo veri animali, veri esauriti
Ed un paio d'anni ce li persi lo stesso, cazzate in strada
Appresso ad altri quattro scappati di casa
Scappati non si intende letteralmente
A casa non mi è mai mancato né l'affetto né niente
Se dai poveri ho imparato a fare i contanti
Dai ricchi, poi, a reinvestirli e farne altri
E dai poveri a parlare come mangi
Ma è dai ricchi che ho imparato a scegliere i ristoranti
Ed io e i miei non siamo mai stati uguali
Chissà com'è che pensavo che non aveste niente da insegnarmi
Sono cresciuto senza mai accontentarmi
Chissà com'è che ora non trovo il modo per ringraziarvi

Ti basta l’acetone e tieni un sasso compresso, fesso

Dal sogno di una bella donna che mi mantenga
Le sette e mezza, sono già in ritardo
Mi vesto al volo, colazione con Marlboro
Milano è grigia, mi sembra un freezer
In motorino, senza Uno diesel
Al magazzino dove lavoro
Per otto ore, a volte nove
Timbro il cartellino, poi mi reco al nastro
Tiro su ogni pacco incellophanato
Dopo lo accatasto sopra ad un bancale
La fattura a lato e ne aspetto un altro
Ogni tanto pauso, due minchiate
Caffè scrauso, si riparte
Alle sei stacco, si torna a casa
E poi mangio stanco e vado dritto a nanna
E sogno il cash

Zio, è dura far piovere, piovere cash
Com'è dura far piovere cash
Zio, è dura far piovere, piovere cash
Com'è dura far piovere cash

A mezzogiorno il sole filtra
Scaldo una pizza, stappo una birra
Mi suona il cella e già sbattella
Il tipo è qua sotto ed è sotto con la barella
Bella, bella, eh eh
Prendo su il cash e poi dico bella
Bella, bella, eh eh
Do un colpo di pedivella
E metto in moto, vado dal tipo
Gli porto quanto abbiamo pattuito
E passo in piazza e blocco Vito
E mi prendo quel che abbiamo pattuito
Ma, fra', è la sera che faccio il delirio
Che lavoro bene e che riprendo il giro
Ma c'è sempre un guaio, sto nello schifo

E caccio via la groupie, butto il cash sul letto
Così prende il taxi, faccio i bagagli
Che tra venti minuti c'ho un altro concerto
Lì becco l'applauso, scendo dal palco
Nel backstage abbraccio tutto quanto il branco
Sono le mandrie ed io il Rio Grande
Si dissetano come su Discovery Channel
Per farli stare bene occupo il privé
Ordino Moët, sordido strip club
E per fare stare bene me prendo una miss
Lascio lì il team, pago la suite
Ma poi nel buio mi imparanoio
Non ho più sonno, no non ho più un soldo
E il CD non vende come ci si attende
La danza della pioggia mi ritorna in mente

A Tony gli è arrivata buona, fra', odora dalla stagnola
La prima al mattino sfonda, la curva la prendo comoda
Fatti un giro nel quartiere, fatti un G nel quartiere
Alzano più polvere anche di un GT in un cantiere
Ba-ba-barona più o meno così funziona
In culo all'assicurazione, il telaio giù nell'Olona
Ogni settimana di merda, aspettando il weekend, fra'
Tanto sarà come l'altro weekend: in discoteca
Se uno è benestante per noi è un prosciutto con due gambe
Auto sportive intestate alla madre, e buste nelle calze
Non c'è mai nessuno, fra', quando accadono i fatti qua
Quando attaccano a uno lì tutti quanti affacciati, sì

Fatti un giro nel quartiere, vieni a vedere
È come un quadro in cui dipingo in rima una situazione reale
Vieni a vedere, vieni a vedere
Fatti un giro nel quartiere

Dove se sei a casa affacci se fischio sotto il balcone
E se mi viene in casa imbosco le chiavi e si fa il doppione
E di giorno non sembra male perché il quartiere ha il verde
Ma di notte si dorme male perché il quartiere è al verde
Ex ladri d'autoradio, zio, è dura adattarsi oggi
Computer, palmari, iPod, tutto quello che piscia soldi
Ed ogni cosa va a chi se la prende, le prepotenze
Di famiglie marce, guastano la vita a quelle oneste
(Noia) puttan-tour in scooter e sputi sopra una troia
Ogni bar ha un soprannome, fra', sempre le stesse storie
L'ha data a credito ad un tipo, mai più visto, manco un euro
Poi gl'ha mandato un rumeno, e mai più visto, manco a quello

Fatti un giro nel quartiere, vieni a vedere
È come un quadro in cui dipingo in rima una situazione reale
Vieni a vedere, vieni a vedere
Fatti un giro nel quartiere

Dopo l'eccesso, zitto nel letto, aspetti che scenda
Mura in cartongesso, sento una vecchia ogni notte si lamenta Para 
poi c'è quello di fronte ch'è senza qualche rotella
E mentre fumo l'ultima, scazza da solo alla finestra
I ragazzini di adesso parlano in fretta
La volante intercetta, la getta, lo sgama, schiaffeggia
E quello si spaventa, confessa e si porta altri appresso
I ragazzini di adesso parlano in fretta, zio, te l'ho già detto
Nel quartiere, i calci e le umiliazioni
Gli schiaffi e sottomissioni, senza soccorritori
Possono uccidere il demone che hai dentro per i troppi torti
O fare sì che lo controlli, ci rende forti

Arriva arriva zio 
Arriva arriva 

Bacia la mano finché non la puoi ta-ta-tagliare 
È doppio gioco in strada, occhio in strada, noi alle case 
Arriviamo un mese prima del comune ad occupare 
Con bombola del gas e luce attaccata alle scale. 
Arriva anche se non vuoi, passa sotto le porte, 
Come lo sfratto quando bussano e nessuno risponde. 
Scrittore del blocco senza il blocco dello scrittore, 
Pagare per scopare è contro la mia religione. 
Fatico a stare a galla, voglio andare dove si tocca, 
Questa fa la santa, voglio andare dove si tocca, 
La vera roccia battezzata con l'acqua sporca, 
L'Italia è in ginocchio, chissà a chi fa una pompa!? 
Musica cruda spacca il mercato come Frank Lucas, 
Tra me e te, baby, ci sono solo 3 Cuba, 
Arriva all'alba come la questura e quando bussa 
Vediamo se sei minchia molla o minchia dura. 

Bacia la mano finché non la puoi tagliare 
E non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio. 
Arriva arriva quello che deve arrivare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare frà. 

Lo leggi negli sguardi: popolare, 
È la parola senza muovere il labiale. 
Portavo il nome della via nelle zone 
Ora è la via che porta il mio nome. 
Tu giochi in casa al chiuso, 
Io no giochi in casa, in plaza era al chi uso 
Ora sono le giostre per tutte le volte che mi sono state tolte. 
Inoltre la sorte è una stanza senza porte 
Solo chi abbatte I muri ne esce. 
Tuo padre correggeva I tuoi sbagli 
Ora sei tu che correggi I tuoi figli. 
Due stracci addosso il lusso tra I vetri, 
Ora mi vedi mentre vesto completi. 
E no zio, non è Sanremo 
Qui arriva chi deve arrivare primo. 

Tutte le infamie, I torti e I conti da pagare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio. 
Arriva arriva quello che deve arrivare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare frà. 

Ehi zio, se sei al mondo sai che arriva, 
Come l'aumento ai cilindri di nicotina, 
E il pakistano alla pompa della benzina, 
E il nuovo film di Natale dei Vanzina. 
Oh, se parli troppo arriva arriva, 
Zio giocalo al Lotto è una cinquina. 
Frà impara chi comanda a Milano 
Non fare l'indiano, due volte come Calissano
Tutti galli nel privè, ma sono serie B come un film di Michael Paré, 
Non vai in Hit Parade e arriva, 
Non sei una star zio ti mancano le palle, sei una diva. 
Hai la collana con l'emblema, si, 
Poi vedi la mia ch'è grossa come la catena dell'altalena. 
Non sei un Dogo, e arriva arriva, 
Conviene metterti l'olio d'oliva. 

Tutte le infamie, I torti e I conti da pagare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio. 
Arriva arriva quello che deve arrivare

E vai nei club col bling bling opaco
L'hai preso a Napoli e ti hanno fatto 'o pacco
E vai a strusciarti in pista, ma non hai il pacco
Tiri e ritiri piste e ti si è ritirato

A non badare a chi paga queste serate
Io e te a far l'amore presi dalla smania
Ma quando abbiamo voglia, senza tornare a casa
Sono solo io che t'ho tenuta sempre a distanza la parte pulita
La zona franca, senza la maschera
Tentando di difenderti, tenendoti lontana dalla mia testa calda
Da questa gente marcia e ti ho sprecata, ed ora spreco carta
Innamorato di un sogno di strada, di un'idea di rivalsa
Ma a te serve costanza, sentirla dentro
La morte di una bambina, la vita che hai scelto, e adesso

Sono vivo, e ho ancora lei vicino
Accucciata sul sedile, almeno lei è innocente
Lei che non sa niente di quello che combino

Come ho potuto? Chissà, forse era destino
E butto giù un sorso dal suo finestrino
Per tenere chiuso fuori il buio, arriverà il mattino
E non farmi domande e io non ti dirò bugie

Messina splende, guido tra i fichi d'india
Arance di Sicilia, lei si sistema il trucco alle ciglia
Arriviamo che sono già a tavola, Rino è a capotavola
È sorpreso ma non chiede che ci faccio là
Ci sistema fuori Avola
Vecchia casa isolata, tutta in pietra, e, puff, sembra una favola
Se ne innamora e io penso che sia un bel modo
Per un uomo di passare la sua ultima settimana
Stiamo solo per qualche ora, io bevo, sciolgo quel nodo
Ora quella tenda chiudila, che mi va

Passati i primi giorni non penso nemmeno più a scappare
Non le dico mai no, qualsiasi cosa voglia fare
Il mare, le cene, la pace, le chiese, le strade di giorno
Lei così viva e bella, io dentro morto
Più mi accorgevo di quanto era bella averla
Più si avvicinava il momento di perderla
E lei era sempre stata lì, come una fune tesa
E io non mi ero mai allungato per prenderla
Ed ora era tardi, troppo tardi per me e lei
Dopodomani sarò a Milano alle sei
Per dirgli ""non ce l'ho fatta"", che non ho i soldi
Per prendermi due colpi e pareggiare i conti
Un cerchio sopra di me, i loro volti mentre è a te che penso
Mentre crepo e vado all'inferno, leggi il biglietto
Ho messo i soldi in un doppiofondo, un tramonto

Sì, frà, sì, quelle che vedi in tele scopo
O quasi, quelle che vedi col telescopio
Un paio di famose, per non deludere gli amici
E farli felici, ma a che scopo?
E dici che razza di uomo sono
Che faresti al mio posto?
Fanno a gara, come se fosse un concorso
Niente para, ho eliminato il rimorso
Cupido piantami una freccia addosso
L'amore è un tango, due passi avanti e uno indietro
Io a ogni casqué ne lascio una sopra il pavimento
Dopo un orgasmo è l'unico momento in cui non penso
Mixo le miss come le hits in heavy rotation

Bianca, gialla o color caramello
Quando mi sveglio, capelli lunghi nel mio lavello
Mi-mi-mixare è bello
Mixa-mixare è bello, è bello
Tu come fai a stare sempre con quello?
Sarebbe bello che una lasciasse il segno, ma

Marracash,"Ora tarda, c'è bufera
Dormo solo con la TV accesa
Questa camera è spoglia come la mia anima
Spero la notte sia rapida
E il cuore è un vecchio apparecchio in disuso
Siamo fantasmi in un guscio
E mangio fissando il muro
Tanto mai a nessuno è importato un cazzo

In ogni città seduto in un bar
Mandavo in silenzio un segnale che fa
E anche se cerco ormai da tempo
Non c'è risposta al segnale che fa

Abituarsi a non aspettarsi più niente di nuovo
Abituarsi a sentirsi solo
Sempre, semplicemente, fingere niente
E gente come formiche, porta molliche, sempre più piccole
E non è una guerra se non si può vincere
Quando esistere diventa resistere

E giro da un po', e giro da un po'
E giro da un po', sono in giro da un po'

Come gli attori nei cartelloni
Chiedo: ""È così che dev'essere un uomo?""
Solo favori per altri favori
Forse è così, non esiste altro modo
Come siamo arrivati fin qui? O è sempre stato così?
Credo solo al segnale orario, in radio, se guardo in tele il TG

Sono ferita, mi hai quasi uccisa, sono la voce che suggeriva
Quando le notti io ti tenevo sveglio, tu mi tenevi pulita
Eri un illuso, forse hai dovuto
Non vuoi fidarti più di nessuno
E il segnale che ora mandi alla gente
Suona come un disturbo incomprensibile

Su, sì che avevamo nemmeno quattordici anni
Bambini, chili su chili, su motorini rubati
Racconto solo la storia
Noi su una ruota come una scuola
Da figlio di buona madre a di buona donna
Mi sveglio sei sette volte
Sei sette donne, mi sveglio e ho già vomitato 6 volte 
Sei sette cocktail
Sogna di vivere come sogna
Per più di quello che ha ora
Da figlio di brava gente
Ad un pazzo con la pistola
Cambio la storia
Come ho già fatto con gli altri in zona
Sì una ogni quarto d'ora
Quattro rapine in un'ora
Grossi termiti, come me li stermini?
Malaria, germi
Sono un vocabolario, ho termini
Dopo me termini

Vengo da complessi popolari
Compressi dentro alveari
Complesssi alle elementari
Comnplessi di metallari
Con prezzi ben superiori ai compensi
Frate' non pensi che qualche tale compensi
Con qualche affare
Compresi noi (io e Achille)

Io e Achille tipo bis di stili, biz di kili
Tris di primi, auto-distruttivi
Non tratto con i distintivi, istintivi
Ho tratti distintivi mai visti in TV (puf)
Nato in un'anfora
Nelle gole di Alcantara
I miei non hanno scopato
Ma strofinato una lampada
Ho chiesto a un bimbo chi era Cristo
E m'ha detto una statua
Spacchiamo tutto come Crisso e Spartaco a Capua
Se vi scuoto cadono le bugie
Vieni dopo tutte le gerarchie
Maschilista non diciamo eresie
Queste arpie vogliono il cazzo, 'fra
Non le mie poesie

A caso quei giorni che frequentavi io frequentavo
Tu qualche anno dopo, scendo e ti incrocio nel mio palazzo
Tu fermo che sembri già un uomo fatto e non più un ragazzo
E così vengo a sapere
Tu e un mio amico fate affari insieme
E a vederti un po' di più in quartiere
A poco a poco in tre tutte le sere
Attratti da te e dal tuo mestiere
Dal tuo rifiutarti di cadere
Perché a casa mia si urlava e basta e c'era la rassegnazione invece
A vent'anni il mio amico va via dall'Italia e io e te diventiamo fratelli
Gli scherzi e ti faccio dieci grammi esatti tagliati ad occhio, ""scommetti?""
Ospite dai tuoi parenti, io e te insieme sempre
Non giudico mai le tue scelte e sto zitto se parli con gente
Durante consegne ogni giorno a firmare alle sette
Ricordi quel giorno
Ti dico la rollo
La fumiamo mentre portiamo giù Lollo
Ma appena noi scesi giù lungo la strada
Ci fermano e salgono, perquisa in casa
Cercano ovunque: vani e cassetti, intercapedini in delle pareti
Tu che ti sbracci, ti agiti e neghi
Io solo so dove la tieni!
Leggevi quelle lettere, forse solo io ti ho visto piangere
Frate, perché oltre a mantenerti, avevi sulle spalle un padre in carcere
Piangi di nervoso contro un destino che sembra abbia già deciso
Sono fortunato con una famiglia, e solo lì l'ho capito!
Ho tirato con te al sacco
Frate sei salito sul mio palco
Quando ancora guidavo, suonavo e scazzavo per farmi pagare una camera in quattro

(Cattivi presagi,cattivi presagi)
E sembra che ogni notte l'inferno ci apra le porte
Un po' per lavoro, un po' per svago ci diamo forte
Tra me e te, solo case popolari ininterrotte
Dividevamo pane, lusso e discussioni profonde
Quante volte ripetevi che quella sostanza era una porcheria?
Dicevi sia solo un sfizio, ma è un vizio che diventa una malattia
La tua pazzia, veniva fuori nelle depressioni fra' del giorno dopo
L'odio che sai controllare da sobrio
Ma quando sei fatto ti rende un demonio
Scatti di ira feroci
Spacchi teste come noci
Scappan veloci
Tu testa a testa che scazzi pure coi miei amici e i miei soci
Io che non so come fermarti perché chi ho davanti fra' non sei più tu
E non so più io se fidarmi come il mio tattoo

Tu chiudevi effetti personali in un pacco
E prego la tua stella
Tu troppo grande per una cella
Avrei voluto scrivere una conclusione più bella
A volte da un'altra madre nasce un fratello
E a volte tra tanto male nasce un gioiello
E niente cancella, tu sappi che ti porto dentro in eterno

Sappiamo che la vera vita è altrove
Tu fai progetti ne hai una lista
Poi la vita fa quello che vuole
C'è qualcosa che non va in me
È proprio come fossi due persone
E ognuno odia l'altro suo é
Ma hanno in comune soltanto il dottore
 
Cose noiose ti scoccia che te ne parlo
Vorresti essere a un tavolo con la boccia nel ghiaccio
Tutti che fanno Jersey Shore tutti così estroversi
Poi dove conta più esserci, che divertirsi tanto
Cercando un punto fermo
Qualcosa che sia per sempre
Siamo pieni di tutto però non lasciamo niente
Non sarei così noioso se non mi sentissi così solo
Che ci faccio qui cosa c'entro con loro
 
Mi chiamano lacrima per ciò che ho insegnato
Mi chiamano fuoco per il vuoto che ho lasciato
Perché amo amo amo
Perché odio odio odio
Perché dedico alla vita solo il meglio di me
 
Balliamo intorno alle bugie
Viviamo tra le rovine
Passiamo vite
Sperando il meglio debba ancora avvenire
Insostenibile pesantezza dell'apparire
Materialismo, nel rap ne siamo le cheerleader
Dai dimmi ancora che sono pesante
Quando inizio con sti discorsi che chi se ne sbatte
Da dove vengo è più importante saper incassare che darle
Io preferisco incassare ed andarmene
 
Mentre certi personaggi
Esseri umani marci
Dio lo preferisco quando fa i paesaggi
Dentro lucide macchine
Queste luci dei palchi
Che fanno splendere me
Ma mettono in ombra gli altri
Asseconda i tuoi amici vedi dove ti porta
Io già vedo che fingi che ti accontenti per forza
Non sarei così noioso se non mi sentissi così solo
Che ci faccio qui cosa c'entro con loro

Mi chiamano fuoco per il vuoto che ho lasciato
Perché amo amo amo
Perché odio odio odio
Perché dedico alla vita solo il meglio di me
 
Non c'è vita dopo la morte
Ma a volte nemmeno prima
Fortuna che c'ho ancora l'ironia, Mina

Tu che fai una foto che testimonia che esisti
Questo Range Sport ci pesa più stare in fila
Tu sull' iPhone china presa da chi c'è in linea
E la vista mi sembra nuova ora che sono in cima
Ora che non si muore più di fame ma d'invidia e provi
La convivenza, la convenienza
Però si inizia sempre con e si finisce senza
Restare grigio in auto qui o una nuova partenza
Ho avuto già due vite ora ne inizio una terza
Sono stanco di parlare di com'è, di com'è con te
Vorrei parlare di come potrebbe essere
Non essere noioso, non sentirmi più solo
Stare bene così senza un posto nel mondo

Mi chiedo ora quanto ancora in la mi posso sporgere
Guardo le stelle come se potessero rispondere
Durante un temporale ho visto la spina dorsale del cielo
Stavo conciato male, pero c'ero! 
La verità mi è entrata in casa quasi di soppiatto
Le ho detto di restare ferma e le fatto un ritratto
Mi hai portato in posti dove mai ero stato prima
Leggi il mio volto come una cartina
Dividiamoci il mio cuore tipo l'ultima siga
Ho aspettato a scrivere di te fino quasi l'ultima rima
È strano fra', l'amore ci imbarazza
Chi lo mette in piazza di solito
Pensa a quanto mette in tasca
Se queste frasi non sono abbastanza e manca il titolo
È perché per descriverlo la parola non basta

Ammalarsi di una donna
Tra le spire fra, Anaconda
Come so che sei davvero tu? 
E non una bella menzogna
Noi due corpi e solo un ombra
Il mio respiro che si accorcia
Ora so che sei davvero tu
E qualcosa resterà

E metto a nudo le paure che ho
Non sono un uomo sono un simbolo
Lasciare che il mio personaggio uccida Fabio o peggio che lo renda schiavo un'altra volta no",Untitled

Voglio stare al top solo per non vederci te
Questi armadi in giacca Armani fanno affari con me
La tua storia non mi è nuova, è che ero io e non te
Non parlare a me di swag, sto sull'Uomo Vogue, nuovo flow

Quando esce il tuo disco non se ne accorge nessuno
Il mio lo attendono come i parenti di un detenuto
Se non ti entra in testa questa, forse hai lasciato chiuso
Spruzzo carisma come fosse il nome di un profumo

Allora sono uscito e le ho comprato un'altra tele
Io non ho figli però ho un tenore da mantenere

Spacchi nella tua città ma io sono nazionale
Dai a me del commerciale su un giornale

Ai giornalisti entrambe le cose gli sembra troppo

È col ritornello pacco alla Gemelli Diversi
Dici: Se dovessi fare un feat. chi chiameresti?
Dico di fisso Emma, fratè non ho detto chiaveresti
Ma vedendo i suoi ex, penso che non capisca il mio swag
Manco conosce Kanye West
Sempre insoddisfatta, sempre che aspetta l'amore
Scrive un singolo migliore con Guè in un motel a ore
Se canto con Malika metto d'accordo la critica
Ma giusto una canzone, l'azione la vedo critica
E invece Baby K? Le insegnerei a rappare
In una cosa a tre con Bianca Atzei, mi darei da fare
Bè, Dolce Nera è un gran bel pezzo
Non ci faccio un pezzo
Chiara? Zero arrazzo manco il pezzo manco, mmh
Ha vinto un'altra cozza come l'edizione scorsa

Simply the best, Tina Turner

Ma qui non esiste catarsi, sorelle che fanno lap dance fino a tardi
Così tanti anni che faccio sti sbatti che non devo più presentarmi
Sto in giro tutta la notte perché è nel buio che brilla una stella
Coi bravi ragazzi frequento davvero tu hai soltanto visto Good Fellas
Tu che mi parli d'hip-hop, di stile, di flow e di compagnia bella
È come Suarez quando chiede a Tony Montana se se ne intende di barella
Ritorno serio nello stereo
Classico flow fa Stravinskij

Sbattimento tipo squillo nel silenzio fatto da un numero anonimo
Proiettile che parte vedi rosso tipo Marte
La fama mi ha portato invidia e infamia
Dalla penna esce il sangue come quando entra la lama
La mia gente in poltiglia
Vedo il futuro scuro nel fumo di una bottiglia
Destini scritti in faccia
Dramma marchio di famiglia
Malfattori benpensanti e nulla cade
Cerchi di riconoscere i tuoi santi
Tattoo e salsa di soia, l’indagine istruttoria
Il foglio e la sua voglia, la mia ex oggi si ammoglia
Schiacciati dai palazzi non solo dentro alla Bibbia le parabole ormai stanno sui terrazzi
Ed è così che va

Tagliai i legami, uccidi i tuoi cari e riprendili solo quando da solo te la cavi
La testa si fa dura, cocciuta
Se il mondo ti rifiuta
Il volto di un codardo è la nuca
L’uomo del mio tempo è ancora quello della clava
Solo che ora butta in rete la spazzatura
E non a caso l’esito
L’una è la notte, fra gli uomini vanno a mignotte
Sperando le fighe non lo diventino
Io vendico il tuo reddito
Non sento le rime dei rapper, perchè non soffro il solletico
E non sono cambiato ho solo un altro domicilio

Won't buy it one more time
Or pretend to be sympathetic

I says I like the contact but I just can't taste it

That's the question to be asked
Life goes on around you
In so many different ways
I know my share of history
How hard it is to be free
From wearing masks that turn to skin
Hiding what could have been

And I, I I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose

Don't buy dreams too easily
They're never what they seem to be
I want to sweep confusion clear
And never turn it back for me

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

The astronaut who goes in space
I, I'd like to take his place
His imagination's free
From the force of gravity
Take photographs and tape recordings
Play them back and try to find
If there is life on other worlds
And do they have a message

[Chorus]

If I climbed higher than the sun
Looked into the universe
Back on Earth, I'd never speak
Just smile at everyone

Ride with me, baby
Til the end of the day

Popping pills just gets you busted
And the prophets were unwise
A beautiful thing has fallen through
With cancer, death and poverty
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sanest of us all?
Is he with me or one of them
How does he dress, who are his friends?

Can I have my vision back?
I live outside the city walls
You don't have to be afraid of me
Until I come together

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

Mama's home philosophy
Makes everyone a freak but me
She says that grandma's hated you
And sends me all her love
I left home with sad goodbyes
Mama sits alone and cries
You can always count on us
Sorry, please come home

I write home I'm doin' fine
But it's just to ease her mind
'Cause I'm starving in the street
And can't predict the future

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

So many ways of living life
And each one has evangelists
Who say they've found the only way
And want it all to go astray
I can't got time to live 'em all
So which one am I gonna choose
You know that I don't wanna lose
The promise of adventure

[Chorus]

The funeral procession passes
Yes, I'm really twenty-one
People expect great things of me
The man of the year whose time has come

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

A moment's happiness in life
Is vaporized within the night
The lover that I had last week
Has kicked me out the door
I wrench in terror a plastic player
Of attitudes and old taboos
That keep me cold, outside of you
Trying to jump your fences

I'll soon find out what you want with me
I hope you'll be the last on Earth
Can't build a future in my head
That can't exist in time

Mars Ill,"Honey, I'm home! Where's my dinner? And this place is a mess
And less than adequate, marked with laziness and soap-opera watching
Clean it top to bottom now or face the consequences
Stop that sentence, I don't really want to hear your feedback
Smack the taste out of your loud mouth now
Sweetheart, the game is on and you just fouled out
How about a little affection thrown in my direction honey?
Yeah, I'm sorry for the way I yelled about the money that I lost
Gambling last night, but you must be on the crack pipe
If you think I'ma let a woman take that tone with me
And I know they cut the phone, see? But I wasn't trying to hear it
I didn't mean to break your face, I just wanted to break your spirit
And your arm the night before, I thought we agreed that was an accident
Now the neighbors called the cops on some old assault and battering
And I'm a man of my word and all my words got 4-Letters
The door is that way, but you'll never do any better than me
This is my house, I'm the man, I rule with the hand of fear
You don't like it? Get out! Now go get me another beer
Did I make myself clear? Don't make me say it twice
I worked a double shift last night and don't got time to play it nice
As for the lipstick on my collar, well that's my business
You're my wife and all that, but let's face it. You got your limits
You're dependent on this bread winner 'cause you're barefoot and pregnant
I'm a part of your life til I decide to make my exit...

He's the alpha, the top of the pile, the leader of the pack
You'll listen when he talks because he's got it like that
Matter fact he rules with iron fist, gripping misfortune
He learned to be a man from his father before him
Yeah, he's the alpha, the first person in every universe
Version 5.0 pack animal with blood thirst and stamina
The root of family trees where so many have fallen
He'll provide for your needs, but please proceed with caution
The Alpha...

Now I was called long ago to grow to be a man
And show the ones before and after me so maybe they could understand
And know the facts that with power, responsibility's attached
And the appropriate response isn't always to react
And attack the weakness of beautiful creatures 'cause we can't
It's our duty to implant wisdom and patience in our stance
And it's true that woman was made from man's rib, so oddly
When you sin against your wife, you sin against your own body
And an open fisted beatdown is never an option for mine
For she was made in God's image, so I'm inclined to put her desires
And needs before me daily and see my lady as a queen
Her submission is a calling that isn't enforced by me
Cause I'm free from a GQ
Maxim
Playboy establishment
Christ is the man I strive to be like and that's no accident
My dad implanted the fuel and the means that I found vital
If your father was a deadbeat or absent, you can break the cycle
Take the Bible and tradition and follow the map accordingly
Spread the answers I've found around the world
I'll firmly lead my household and display emotions openly
And show my people what a real man's supposed to be...

Cause I'm the Alpha, called and destined, the leader of the pack
I'll listen when you talk because I've got it like that
Matter fact, I'll protect you with my life because I love you
And carry you on my back through everything we have to trudge through
The Alpha, first person in every universe
Version 6.0, sacrifice my body to the dirt
I challenge Alpha Males to change so you can see
A man standing there where a boy used to be

Marsha Ambrosius,"I can love you better
Lose myself in love

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

Couldn't tell me I was in love when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love
Should a told me I was worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said!
So I could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is

And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love, so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby baby

Marsha Ambrosius,"I won’t pretend
That I intend to stop living
I won’t pretend
I’m good at forgiving
But I can’t hate you
Although I have tried
I, I, I

Like every other hour when I think about you
So now and then I drink about you
Trying to numb the pain with Juice and Gin
It’s like abuse, what’s the use of the bumps and bruises
If we moving towards a losing end
If I’m losing you then I refuse to win
Went from friendships with benefits
Funerals and your innocence
I can help you reminisce we in Madrid
On some double O 7 shit, we off the grid
Parting moments of pleasure, we never thought we’d ever
Suffer the consequences, the problem is
there’s a problem trying to kick this addiction
We probably can't resolve it without causing some friction
This is non-fiction, the definition of a true story
I’m like fuck pride baby that’s the kind of shit you do for me
Suicide it's a suicide, ready to die, you down to ride or what?

I won’t pretend
That I intend to stop living
I won’t pretend
That I’m good at forgiving
But I can’t hate you
Although I have tried

I still really really love you
My love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you

Sitting here wasting my time
Would be like
Waiting here for the sun to rise
It’s all too clear
Things come and go
Sitting here waiting for you
Would be like waiting for winter
It’s gonna be cold
There may even be snow

I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Love is stronger
I still really love
Love is stronger than pride

Stronger than pride

If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered

Marshall Crenshaw,"Blues is king 
A beautiful thing 
You just don't know whenever you're done by the one you love 
And the joke's on you 
If you don't know it's true 
If you lose your dreams 
You'll know what I'm thinking of 
Yeah, blues is king 
So let it ring

Surrender do, to the sound so real and true 
And relax your mind, go on, you'll be fine 
Surrender do, 'cause you'll never displace it 
So face it, blues is king 
As the sun descends, rain begins 
Everything in view 
Is a dull shade of blue 

And the traffic sounds, the lights uptown 
Make a sad and uninviting scene to walk into 
But the blue of the night 
Everything in daylight 
Don't even begin, to be as blue as the mood I'm in 
People out alone, on their way home 
I'm wandering on, remembering only 
That I'm lonely 
And blues is king 
Blues is king, 
A beautiful thing 

You just don't know whenever you're (torn) by the one you love 
And the joke's on you 
If you don't know it's true 
If you lose your dreams 
You'll know what I'm thinking of 
Yeah, blues is king, 
So let it ring

Marshall Crenshaw,"Here we go again, wasting each other's time
The look in your eyes, when they look into mine
Brings into view, the distance between me and you

(Oh no)
Here we go again, through the same old misery
Look into my eyes, and it's easy to see
We can't undo, the distance between me and you

[Chorus:]
'Cause the years have gone by, and you and I
Have been through heaven and hell,
I've felt the joy in your heart, seen your world fall apart
We know each other well

And through promises broken, words left unsaid
Pride has been injured, and tears have been shed
That's why it's true, there's a distance between me and you

Yet both of us know, in the back of our minds
When it comes right down to the bottom line
We'll make it through, the distance between me and you

Whenever I've needed someone, you've always seemed
To be the first friend I've found
When you needing someone, you've got to know
That I'll never let you down
I'll always be right around

[Chorus]

And I know that we know, in the back of our minds

Oh I'm sorry, and so is Brenda Lee

Well, it's funny how the world turns 'round
It's funny how the seasons go
It's funny how it always rains on the day you get your shoes shined
And it's funny, how apart we've grown
Oh yeah baby it looks like you've gone your way,
And I guess I'll go mine

Oh, I know you've got your reasons for being unkind
Aw, but that's all right, darlin'

Would surely lead to more problems

Marshall Crenshaw,"You gave me a reason, to laugh when I was down 
And you are all I feel for, or care for in this town

Where all of this will be, a vague memory 
We see old friends and lovers, with sadness in their eyes 

Dark empty places, we don't quite recognize 
Yes baby the world that we once knew now seems 
To be be fading like scenes from old dreams 
It's fading gradually, like a vague memory 
A vague memory, may never go away 
But it won't bring you down, day after day 
For those who can't feel what a young heart can feel 

This place holds something familiar and real 
But for you and me, it's a vague memory 
You gave me a reason to laugh when I was down

That it soon will move on and restart

Makes no difference, I'm a fool any old way

Well all those nights they hit rock bottom
The songs they sang, well, we forgot 'em
You could hear them play with shaky hands
Guitars strung up with rubber bands
Singing do you want a man of steel?
Or do you want a man that's real
They used to play in the courts of kings
Now they're only made of steel when they're
On steel strings
They used to be on every schoolgirl's wall
And they never dropped the beat at all
They could make it soar, they could make it hot
Once they got started they could never stop
Singing, do you want a man of steel or
Do you want a man that's real?
Some of them hide when the doorbell rings
They're only made of steel when they're on steel strings
Playing the man on steel strings
Were you expecting maybe superman?
The best they do is the best they can
The manager's doing time in jail (applause)
And the pink cadillac is up for sale
Singing do you want a man of steel
Or do you want a man that's real
They try their hands at a thousand things

Been thinking this over for many long nights

It's so hard to trust in anything said

Colors ran all across the ground 
Then a thousand stars were spinning all around

I saved you place right by my side 
And waited there in the candlelight 
But the only friend I had in sight was an empty chair 
You should've been there

Ran into some people we used to know 
They were going somewhere I didn't want to go 
So I kept on waiting for just a little bit more 
Not getting anywhere, you should've been there 

Then I thought I saw you walking by into town 
Into the crowd I went chasing you down 
When I grabbed your arm, she spun around 
A stranger glared, you should've been there 

You should've been there 
There's always so much to see in this old town 
Don't you agree 
But then again I never said I'd be anywhere

Don't judge yourself so brutally 
I can't stand it when you talk that way 
Oh baby, baby 
Better back off of that stuff 
You'd better take it slow 
I know you know 
That you're talking about someone I love 
Did you say what I think I heard? 
Did you mean what I think you said? 
Why don't you redirect your rage 
Onto someone else instead 
Now, we all have to walk that line 
Between sorrow and happiness 
Come over here and take my hand 
Won't you please give us both a rest? 
Oh baby, baby 
Better back off that stuff 
You'd better take it slow

Marshall Crenshaw,"She was kicking down the fence trying to hide the evidence
That would give her game away
But everything was as clear as day
I knew she had no more to give, she hated everything she did
And I could feel her restless mind
Calling out for love at crying time
All those days that seemed like years
The silence roaring in our ears

Then at night a ticking sound
The time bomb of the life we'd found
I watched her leave, my heart in flames
Fanned by all her other lovers' names
And I could feel my restless mind
Calling out for love at crying time
Whiskey, wine and cheap perfume, all those crowded bars

And hotel rooms
Exotic rhythms to embrace
But everywhere is a lonely place

Marshall Crenshaw,"There is a certain appeal to danger and pain
When she whispered those words, I said
Whats your name?
Right then I knew in my heart
That we shouldn't start
But there you go

Could she mess up my mind?
She looked so fine
I just had to know

So we got into her car
And drove to her place
We didn't stop making love
For thirty long days
Until the telephone rang
My very soul she did command
All it took was her smile
The wink of her eye
The wave of her hand

So just imagine how I'm feeling right now

Did she follow that dream like a flaming star

So I say 
(Hey) Delilah 
I want to be beside your bed tonight

Wanda met Duane in a local bar
Next to an industrial park
Duane didn't like the clothes that she wore
But she felt so good in the dark
After a few days they said 'why wait'
And Wanda moved in to stay
Into Duane's apartment on the second floor
Next to the 605 freeway
They made love in the mornin'
Love in the evenin', love in the afternoon
But all good things have got to come to an end
Even in a warm bedroom
Duane got tired of hearing her voice
And Wanda got sick of his breath
Pretty soon they never said a word before falling asleep
On opposite sides of the bed
Oh ain't it a shame
There ain't no one to blame
When love just slips away
And only the lovers remain
Ain't it a shame
There ain't no one to blame
So the names have been changed
To protect Wanda and Duane
Wanda joined a gym but she never went
'cause it was just too far away
Duane held the tv remote control
And smoked three packs a day
Wanda thought that undercover she might take a lover
But you know that she never did
Duane fell in love with all the naked girls
In the magazines that he hid
Oh ain't it a shame

And everything's wrong
I'm wide awake and angry all night long

The memory of the laughter that we used to share
I get lost on the streets

That we used to walk
Where we used to find each other in the dark
Can't find the places where we used to go
Cause they're nothing like they were before,
Like they were before
They're not echoing with laughter anymore

I hear a voice in my head
I start thinking about some random thing that you said
How I hate to realize
That things are how they have to be,
How they have to be
I still can't believe what happened to you and me

You were a friend like no other
I'm afraid that I'm gonna find
That the memory of your laughter
Will never leave my mind

Then back up another day

Tell me all about it
Did you grab somebody new?
Tell me all about it

Marshall Crenshaw,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

Marshall Crenshaw,"Waiting on the runway, rain falling down
I always crawl by, can't get above the ground,
I looked out at the window at the black clouds in the sky
So lonesome I could die

Well, we were on the lookout for adventure and fun
Then we told each other it was over and done
But here I go doing something I can't explain
I'm running to see her again

I want to talk to my little wild one
And I want to rock with my little wild one

Right down to her shoes, she's a little wild one

I shouldn't have told her we both ought to move on
I shouldn't have told her because you know it does not pay

Aw, should I dial the number, or turn and walk away?
Makes no difference, I'm a fool any old way
But I know in my heart everything will be right
When I hold her tonight

I want to carry on with my little wild one
Make love till dawn with my little wild one
She's mine 'till the last day runs down
And I'm a clown for my little wild one

Right down to her shoes, she's a little wild one

Take anything you, anything you want from me

Marshall Crenshaw,"Just last night when we were in bed
This thought came into my head
I would give anything girl
If i could steal a look into your secret world
What do you dream of?
Oh what do you dream of?
I'll never know what really lies
Behind your sleeping eyes
What do you dream of?
Oh what do you dream of?
Can you leave your worldly cares behind
Or do they rule your mind
When i see you smile, i've got a reason to smile
Oh what do you dream of?
I wonder once in a while
Close your eyes you know it feels fine
To let yourself finally unwind
From fighting hard to stay in the game
For all your trouble and time, you're getting more of the same
What do you dream of?
Oh what do you dream of?
When you're in a world that's yours alone

Another day is gone
What do you dream of?
Oh what do you dream of?
Keepin' your secrets to yourself
They're meant for no one else
I'll never solve all of your mysteries
Oh what do you dream of?
While you're lying next to me

'Cause love is in bloom
Right now it's all about you and me Alone In a Room 

Last night the stars were out for us
We took a ride on a downtown bus

How I loved having you next to me
In you favorite clothes and perfume

Marshall Crenshaw,"I fell asleep on the train
With the towering mountains rolling by
And woke to the sound
Of thunder crashing in the sky

The air was ghostly blue
The mist was rising slow
It's still a vivid memory
From a few thousand days ago
From a few thousand days ago

As we passed through small quiet towns
Crossed miles of burning desert sands
And fields of green and gold
I began to see and understand

The wonders great and small
That this world has to show
In a way I never had before
A few thousand days ago
Just a few thousand days ago

I had made up my mind
It was time to let familiar things fall behind
I was glad to be all alone
In the middle of the wide unknown

Through lost empty towns
Across miles of burning dessert sands
And fields of green and gold
I began to feel and understand

The wonders great and small
That this world has to show
Like the promise in a new sunrise
A few thousand days ago
A few thousand days ago

It set my heart and soul at ease
To hear the silence and the wind through the trees
I was glad to be all alone
In the middle of the wide unknown

In a different time

I know it?s hard to believe
So much has turned to dust, yeah, yeah
But this is where home used to be
And it was good to us, more than good to us

This was our place in the world
When life was new and untried
When every wild dream seemed possible
It felt good to be here, it was warm inside, yeah

I have to say, I'm amazed
Even though I learned long ago
That sometimes good things get thrown away
I wish right now that it wasn't so

Those days are good and gone
Around here it?s plain enough, yeah, yeah
This is where home used to be
Where we lived and loved

We were only here for awhile
Then we got drawn away, yeah, yeah

Seem long ago and far away

But they never said things burn
Or that I would have to live and learn

Got a handful of bitter regrets
Like when I betrayed someone

Or in a room with a view

Running down the street in the rain
Under a ladder or two

I can still see her now, running and laughing
And I'm never coming down

I'm never coming down, never coming down
When I close my eyes I'm there
Loving the cool sunshine in a sweet state of mind
Standing close to the edge, feeling safe and sound
I'm never coming down

As the waves crashed and the wind roared
And the clouds rolled
I just stood still and felt heaven bound
On an old mountain road leading skyward
And I'm never coming down
",Never Coming Down
Marshall Crenshaw,"In our old shoes, we walked last night
Sparkling concrete under the lights
Traffic sounds, bouncing off the steel and glass
We traced our steps from the past

Shadows in the curtains on the second floor
I used to have a key to that front door
We didn't know it then
But you and I were just passing through
Passing by

Let's hurry on
No use standing and staring, hurry on
I thought I heard you say, let's walk on
We really can't stay
We're just passing through this way

This world is moving and changing always
We'd better be about new days
For as long as we may, we're just passing through
Just passing through this way

In our old shoes we walked last night
Ghosts of old friends on the left and right
Being there with you gave me a thrill
Like it used to do and always will

We've got dreams to dream, places left to go
When we'll be back there, I don't know
Maybe sometime before we're done
On some other trip around the sun
",Passing Through
Marshall Crenshaw,"Well, someone told me, tried to tell me
It sounded backwards and upside down
Someone told me something
That really messed my head around

And I wondered sadly
I sadly wondered
Could we ever be on common ground?

Read and listen, I watch and listen
It's like a train wreck and I can't turn away
So many worlds colliding
Everywhere, every day

People looking at the same things
All the same things
Them in conflicting ways

Well, if you see me walking down the avenue
Call my name and I just stare a hole through you
Please don't worry about me 'cause I'm really fine
Sometimes I just get lost inside my mind

Someone told me, tried to tell me
He was dressed and painted like a clown
Someone told me something
Tried to mess my head around
Around and round

But I had a feeling he knew
That his words were untrue
We'll never be on common ground

Well, I know a man you can't own up to the things he's done
He's got no sense of honor and never did have one
Where would he be without a wall to hide behind?
I'm glad I'm not the one living in his mind
",Someone Told Me
Marshall Crenshaw,"Your eyes are brown like a stormy river
Your words they twist like a stormy river
You turn to ice like a stormy river in the winter
In the winter, stormy river, stormy river is you

It's a bitter wind that's raging in you
In you so long you no longer hear it
It sweeps across the floor of your spirit
Stormy river, stormy river is you

I'm gonna get far away, get far away fast
'Cause the future looks just like the past
You can't help but leave damage in your midst
I've got no time left in my life for this

Rain comes down like cannonballs
The thunder crashes, the engine stalls
The lightning hits the electric tower
In the midnight hour, stormy river
Stormy river is you

It's a bitter wind that's raging in you
Makes me wonder where you've been to
But I'm wary of asking questions
I don't want to be taught any more lessons
Stormy river, stormy river is you
",Stormy River
Marshall Crenshaw,"I wish I could go walking
Walk out of this place
Maybe see a friendly face
But it's raining and raining

I'm looking down from below
From a thirteenth floor window
It's Sunday afternoon, the sky is ugly grey
I'm here or down there
Right now it's bad news either way

Well, I can't stay
So I guess I'll go out there anyhow
What I don't want right now is
A day of reflection and solitude
With this bitter mood, I'm in again

I tried to call you on the phone
Now I'm stir crazed enough
To go walking in the rain alone

I heard the last church bell's ring
And got the Sunday blues
For this and that and everything
The Sunday blues

That feeling goes stealing down to your shoes
In my head and in my heart
The Sunday blues

I'm on the wrong side of Sunday
Can't get away from dark thoughts today
I've been made blue, been lied to

But enough's enough
I don't need this stuff ok?
Regret and rage, just go back to underground
Mean old Sunday blues, I've had it with you hanging 'round

Yeah, alright I'm done with the Sunday blues
Everyone now and then has to play and lose
So I'll waste no more tears on last year's news
'Til the next time around with the Sunday blues

You gotta be here, you gotta be there
You're always running, always got to be somewhere
No time for living, and the days just slip away
You keep on giving till it's all work and no play
You live by the book, and I live on a prayer
Well, I know how you look with the wind in your hair

Ain't talking about love
Baby, I ain't nobody's Romeo
I'm talking about you and me, wild and free
Flat out, down a winding road
And I'm not sure just what we'll find
But I won't stop until you're satisfied
So climb in, baby, and enjoy the ride

Call me crazy
'Cause I don't care where this will end
But it's amazing how much fun you have 
Not knowing what's ahead
And we might make it, or we might just go down in flames
But you'll be glad you took the chance, and, girl, you'll never be the same
Somewhere down deep you want so bad
To live the wildest dreams that you never had

The pace is slow and the air is clear

Been too far out of touch
And lookin' around me I can see
That just being happy you don't need much

I guess they'll get around to it one of these days

They're still hanging out at the hardware on main

My old house still looks the same
And everybody is on the front porch waitin' on me

Marshall Dyllon,"Hey guys, what's going on?
Man, do you even own a watch?
Glad you could make it
Sorry I'm late
Let's hit the road

Well, there's that tree where I carved her name
(Aw, that's sweet)
Over there's the place where we used to eat
(You and her, and what, four hundred other boyfriends?)
And there's the road that leads down to the lake where I kissed her for the first time
(Aw, what a guy)
Here's where she left me

You know, I admit that it got to me a little
(A little? Oh, come on!)
I guess there for a while I didn't know what to do
(Man, will you shut up? Turn on the radio)
But I know true love is gonna come around again someday
(Yeah, maybe in another twelve, five, uh, never, or, okay, yeah, sure, okay)
Well, this is just something I have to work through
(Shut up!)

Other than her always being on my mind
And even though I think about her all the time
I never miss, I never miss that girl
Except for the occasional falling all apart
It's pretty much only when every day starts
I'll never miss, I'll never miss
I might reminisce but I'll never miss that girl

(I think something just fell out of your wallet, man)
Yeah, that's her picture
(Oh man, I think it scared my dog, and he's blind! Oh wow!)
You know, I've been meaning to put that thing away
(Please do, man 'cause it's killing me)
Hey, is that my cell phone ringing?

Tell me, what does that number say on the caller ID, anyway?

I know You can see it for yourself
But in the early morning hours
In the darkness of this room
I've never been so desperate for Your help 

I still believe that You made me to be with her
Until the day I leave this world behind
But on a pillow wet with tears that still taste of angry words
I can't blame her if she's changed her mind

[Chorus:]
Is she gone?
You're the only one who knows
If that girl who's lying next to me
Has left me here alone
Is she gone?
Is it too late to hear my prayers?
I know that she's right there
But is she gone?

You've already blessed me more than I deserve
And we've both seen the sinner that I've been
So You don't owe me anything, and asking this takes nerve
But You saved us once, Lord, could You again?

And we both know I can't give without that girl

Marshall Dyllon,"Last night I tried so hard to sleep
I counted half a million sheep
And my whole life passed right before my eyes

I say it's a perfect time for us to

Live it up 
There ain't no time to waste, no time
And there ain't no better time to celebrate
Hurry up, can't you feel the urgency
Ain't nothin' we can do when it's too late
And too late's gonna catch us soon enough
So let's live it up

Old man Jones with all he owns
You never see him smile you know
He's sittin' on that big portfolio
It's clear that all that's on his mind
Is the top of the ladder and the bottom line
But he can't take it with him when he goes

Poor old Jones he never learned to dance
I bet he'd trade it all for one more chance to

Live it up

Auf dem Festivalgelände da steht 'ne kleine Bühne
Auf ihr stehen keine Stars, trotzdem hat sie Gefühle
Der Mischer ist 'n Rocker und pennt die ganze Zeit
Ganz ehrlich, die kleine Bühne tut mir Leid
Meistens sitzen sechs Hippies vor ihr in 'nem Schneidersitz
Man hat keine Fans, nur weil man ein bisschen kleiner ist
Das Licht ist 'n Witz, und die alten Boxen rauschen
Die kleine Bühne hat's so satt, würd' so gerne mal tauschen
Einfach mal groß sein und im Scheinwerferlicht

Frier' mir den Arsch ab, kann mich kaum noch bewegen
Und meine Füße - kann nicht sein, dass die so schief sind

Würd' alles dafür geben, dass mich einer fängt
Schön in den Zoo für ein Experiment
Mir egal, meinetwegen auch ins Disneyland
Nur Hauptsache weg, ich fühl' mich so fremd
Nachts, wenn ich schlafe, traurig alleine
Träum' ich von kleinen Kindern hinter 'ner Scheibe
Spring' ins warme Wasser, bekomm' Fische aus'm Eimer

Marston Smith,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll.

And walk this lovely land with me

El presente y nada más
No te engañes, no me engañes 
Y déjate llevar 
El mañana no se ve 
No me importa el después 
Como scarlet, como scarlet 
Ya lo pensaré 

Eres lo que quieres ser 
Dueño de tu propia ley 
Eres como eres
Eres lo que debe de ser

Algo tienes 
Que cambió mi forma de pensar 
Mi manera 
De amarte y de dejarme amar 

Yo tampoco quiero ser 
La sirena en tu red 
Con el tiempo, con el viento podría suceder 
Pon tus alas a volar 
Como velas en el mar 
Pero piensa que en el fondo 
Siempre hay una playa 

Eres lo que quiero ser

Aunque pienses 
Que amenazo tanta libertad 
Nadie puede con las manos 
Contener el mar",Algo Tienes
Marta Sánchez,"A veces pienso
Que no fue real
El eco de un eco
Nada mÃ¡s.
A veces siento
Esa sensaciÃ³n
De clÃ¡sica historia de ficciÃ³n.
Tal vez saliÃ³ de algun lugar
Que no existiÃ³ ni existirÃ¡
Why sÃ³lo yo creÃ­ tocar.
CORO
Amor, amor, amor perdido
En la frontera del olvido
Que un dÃ­a volverÃ¡
Como si tal cosa
A quedarse a vivir.
Amor, amor, amor perdido
Regalo de un desconocido
Que un dÃ­a...
VolverÃ¡ para rescatarme
De mi mundo sin aire...

Algunas noches
Apareces tÃº
Fantasma sin formas
Why sin luz
Entonces vuela
Mi imaginaciÃ³n
Why escucho el sonido
De tu voz
En medio de la soledad
Why dentro de una oscuridad
Que cada vez me envuelve mÃ¡s

Amor, amor, amor perdido...
Tal vez saliÃ³ de algun lugar
Que no existiÃ³ ni existirÃ¡
Why sÃ³lo yo creÃ­ tocar.

Marta Sánchez,"Cuando
Un maldito atardecer
Por cualquier estupidez
Recordamos
Lo que pudo ser pero nunca fue
Vemos
Que la vida es un ladrón
Que te roba lo mejor y después te deja
Con las alas recortadas

Las historias más bonitas
Son así
Se te escapan de las manos
Sin sentir
Pero en ellas no dejamos de creer
Con más fe cada vez

Vamos
Codo a codo hasta el final
Con tu
Estrella y nadie más
Y no puedes nunca
Predecir qué pasará

Somos
Un capricho del azar
Una falsa realidad
Pie que se desliza
Por arenas movedizas

Deja que me ahogue 
Con las gotas de tu amor

Deja que el cielo caiga sobre el mar 
Con tus besos pueda siempre alcanzar 
El universo que se crea cuando estás

No te quiero más
No te quiero más, te lo juro
Aunque no me crees
No te quiero más, no te quiero

Porque cada vez cada
Desengaño es más duro
Porque cada vez cada
Desengaño es más duro
Porque estar contigo
Es como vivir sin futuro

Porque me has vaciado
Cada simple razón de amarte
Porque has destruido
Cada gana de acariciarte

Porque ya está lista
En tu boca otra mentira
Mientras tú me besas
Me preparo a otra tortura

No te quiero más

Porque quererte es sólo una locura
Una estúpida inútil amargura
Que cada día dentro de mí empeora

No te quiero más

Porque quererte
Es sólo un gran castigo
No vale la pena sufrir contigo
Por cada lágrima yo te maldigo

No te quiero más
No te quiero más, te lo juro
Porque me has manchado
Cada sentimiento más puro

Porque me has quitado
Toda la poesía de mis sueños
Porque has apagado la más
Clara estrella en mi cielo

Porque tus palabras
Mortifican cada sentido
Porque tu silencio
Es un insulto a lo que te pido

Porque tu egoísmo
Es un monumento a mis penas
Mucho te pareces
A lo que no eres, sí lloras

No te quiero más

Porque tú no mereces ser amado
Porque eres sólo un niño mal criado
Es que te han querido demasiado

No te quiero más

Porque ya se acabó mi sentimiento
Dejando espacio al arrepentimiento
De qué me sirve haberte amado tanto
Y sigo amándote

El eco de un eco nada más
A veces siento esa sensación
De clásica historia de ficción

Tal vez salió de algún lugar
Que no existió ni existirá
Y sólo yo creí tocar

En la frontera del olvido
Que un día volverá como
Sí tal cosa a quedarse a vivir

Amor, amor, amor perdido
Regalo de un desconocido
Que un día
Volverá para rescatarme
De mi mundo sin aire

Algunas noches apareces tú
Fantasma sin formas y sin luz
Entonces vuela mi imaginación
Y escucho el sonido de tu voz

En medio de la soledad
Y dentro de una oscuridad
Que cada vez me envuelve más

Amor, amor, amor perdido

Tal vez salió de algún lugar
Que no existió ni existirá
Y sólo yo creí tocar

Amor, amor, amor perdido

",No Te Quiero Más
Marta Sánchez,"Aquella noche sentí en silencio 
Como un crujido en el alma 
Que me hizo pensar que este amor 
Llegó al final 

Y desde entonces vivo en recuerdos 
Y no puedo salir de esta nostalgia 
Te fuiste con mi vida sin pensar 

Y aquí sigo intentando 
Borrar todo el pasado 
De un amor que fue 
Todo lo que ves 
No sé cómo caminar 

Y aquí sigo escapando 
De ti quiero encontrar 
Otra vez mi verdad 
Debo continuar 
Y quiero pensar que 
Quizás mañana vuelva a ver amanecer 
Hoy quisiera pensar que voy a escapar 
De esta inmensa soledad 

Quizás muy pronto
No sé cuándo ni con quién 
Tendré el coraje de mirar atrás 
Para enfrentarme con mi realidad 

Y aquí sigo intentando 
Borrar todo el pasado 
De un amor que fue 
Todo lo que ves 
No sé cómo caminar 

Y aquí sigo escapando 
De ti quiero encontrar 
Otra vez mi verdad 
La que un día más 
Me dará fuerzas 
Para continuar 
Oh, oh, oh",Sigo Intentando
Marta Sánchez,"Robo al pasado mis sueños de niña
Y los escondo tras de una razón
Excusas y cada excusa es buena

Robo a la noche sueños más profundos
Más me da gusto y más los escondo
Así, así no me recuerdo

Arco iris de sombras

Entonces corro, corro, corro con manos vacías
Culpables sólo de no haber pecado
Corro con el corazón en la garganta
Culpable más por lo que no he vivido

Socorro, socorro, socorro, socorro

Robo al silencio el eco de una voz
Y lo reflejo en la brisa de una luz
Canto, ahora soy feliz

Robo a la vida una chispa de amor
Y se me enreda siempre el corazón
Amor pero el amor es raro

Arco iris de sombras

Entonces corro
En el laberinto de los sentimientos
Cayendo en el abismo de las dudas
Corro y resbalo en otra mentira
Y cómo la verdad quedó desnuda

Socorro, socorro, socorro, socorro

",Socorro
Marta Sánchez,"Soy yo, la que sigue aquí
Soy yo, te lo digo a ti
Mírame y dime qué es lo que ves
Esa mujer que perdiste una vez

Aquí estoy, sin mirar atrás
Sigo mi vida sin más
Sin comprender cómo ni por qué
Me dejaste marchar
Todo te pude dar

Estuve al borde
Del abismo por tu amor
Lejos de tu mar
Me siento más firme
¡Quédate dónde estás!

Soy yo la que se marchó
Soy yo, sin pedir perdón
Mírame y dime cuál es la verdad
Esa será, tu sentencia final

Hoy al fin podré disfrutar
De lo que es libertad
Creo que llegado el final
No hay más que decir
Me despido de tí

No me molestes
No me busques
No me encontrarás
Lejos de tu sal
Me siento más cerca
De este dulce final

Soy yo la que se marchó
Soy yo, sin pedir perdón
Mírame y dime cuál es la verdad
Esa será, tu sentencia final

Pudiste tenerme
Quisiste perderme, oh, oh
Remo lejos de tu tempestad
(En calma quedará)
Sin tus velas lo podré lograr
(No supiste amar)

Soy yo la que sigue aquí
Soy yo ya te lo advertí
Mírame bien, es la última vez
Soy esa mujer que no podrás tener

Soy yo la que se marchó
Soy yo, sin pedir perdón

Desafinados los que encienden horrores por ahi.
Desafinados los que aquieten,

A sabiendas de que duele.

Marta Sui Tubi,"Un'altra sera a casa a masticare noia e surgelati
La TV vomitava vacui colori, la luce dei pensieri è spenta
Programmerò il mio umore artificialmente e scriverò
Un saggio su come perdere tempo senza sprecare nemmeno un minuto.
Vieni a farmi compagnia fiamma di carta, perditi
Con me nel labirinto di un monolocale
A coltivare il miraggio di stare con i piedi per terra
Sopra il pavimento di un quinto piano condominiale

E non so come ma arriverò puntuale.

Mi manca un kilo di faccia integrale
E due etti di comprensione
E un cartone d' amore a lunga conservazione
Non rimane che fare la spesa
Continuare a pagare
Per quello che voglio e quello che non ho ancora

E non so dove ma arriverò puntuale

Oh che vasta scelta
Mi si presenta
Che sceglierò
Ma voglio di più
Per riempire la cesta
Che sceglierò
Vorrei essere io una volta
Scelto

Sai di vivere una vita che è contro natura,
Dove un giorno è per la notte
Dove la paura va scacciata via in un attimo,
In un gesto attento di quell'anima un po scura che ti porti dentro.
O forse è naturale inseguire il destino,
Perder l'innocenza per sentirsi bambino
E dalle facce appese alle circostanze fai un sorriso beffardo e non ti accorgi neanche",La Spesa

Amys Weinhaus da unten an der Straße
Zu Gast ist Mladen, halb deutsch, halb Kroate
Er hat überlebt, doch ist übersät mit Narben
Spricht kaum Worte, bei ihm zählen nur Taten
Er ist stolz, stolz auf seine Gangsterbraut
Stolz auf seinen Sohn, er bildet ihn zu 'nem Gangster aus
Bringt ihm alles bei, Autos, Frauen, Waffen
Doch sein Sohn mag Tanzen und den Simon aus der Achten
Der Junge wird erwachsen, Papa hat es schwer
Wenn die Typen übernachten und schickt ihn zum Militär
Doch der haut ab, zieht nach Köln in den Kiez
Und mietet ein Apartment in der Christopher Street
Und Papa weint, selbst nach acht Flaschen Lachgas
Verachtet seinen Sohn und bricht komplett den Kontakt ab
Er hat in Amys Weinhaus seinen Trost gefunden
Hing am Strick - doch Amy hat ihn losgebunden

Thomas Mitte 30 lebt in 'nem Saustall
Er denkt, ein Computer regelt seinen Haushalt
Die ganze Welt ist am Twittern und Chatten
Doch sein Held muss das Böse töten, um die Welt zu retten
Seine Freundin ist ein Poster an der Wand
Sein bester Freund ist ein rosa Elefant
Thomas hat Angst, verliert leicht die Beherrschung
Bowling in Columbine, Kegeln in Erfurt
Er verliert sich in unendlichen Weiten
Doch seine Modelleisenbahn springt aus den Gleisen
Er hat in Amys Weinhaus seinen Trost gefunden
Hing am Strick, doch Amy hat ihn losgebunden

No has ido. Seguro, te has quedado tumbado 
tocándote los huevos con la mano y el mando y el arril 
Y la otra no me pasas ni un duro para el puto alquiler 
Pero tu puta maleta te la vas a meter por el culo 
que yo te voy a cerrar la puerta de mi casa

Du bist wunderschön, sexy doch benimmst dich wie mein Vater
Du bist hart, du willst streiten und mir zeigen wer der Boss ist
Bist wie wenn du deine Tage hast, mal Hundert und das Doppelt
Treff' meine Ex, Küsschen rechts, Küsschen links
Kippst dir Sekt in's Gesicht, bisschen rechts, bisschen links
Ich mach 'n Abwasch und jedes zweite Glas geht zu Bruch
Du bist hart, du willst streiten doch ich sag' es war der Hund
Man Mädchen mach' dich locker, sitzt auf deinem Stock im Arsch
Wie auf 'nem Hocker seh' nur noch n' Loch da wo dein Kopf mal war
Schmeißt mit Tellern nach mir aus Langeweile
Schmeißt ne Scheibe ein, schneidest dich und stellst dich dann als Opfer dar
Du bist voll auf Salat, gegen den Speck auf deinen Rippen
Doch klaust Reste von meinem Teller und die Hälfte meiner Fritten
Du bist hart, du willst streiten. Tag ein, Tag aus
Doch alles was du sagst geht bla rein, bla raus

Ich glaub' nicht dass du das bist was ich brauche
Stört mich ja auch nicht dass du isst, wenn ich rauche
Drück' mal auf Pause, bin nur glücklich wenn ich saufe
Und nach 2 Jahren wird mein bestes Stück erdrückt von ner Plauze
Du bist hart, du willst streiten, im Eifer deiner Sucht
Ich bin der Blitzableiter vor all deinem Frust
Dein Papa hat Geburtstag, willst früh um Sieben los fahren
Freust dich auf's Wochenende, ich freu' mich schon auf Montag
Färbst meine Sachen pink, damit ich dich zum lachen bring'
Du bist der Soundtrack meines Lebens, hörst du wie die Platte springt, Platte springt?
Du bist nur an Weihnachten nett, du bist hart du willst streiten
Komm' wir Heiraten jetzt!

Konsole an, das Spiel kann beginn', 
Dicke rote Backen, was für'n niedliches Kind,
Häng' noch fest am Nabel der Zeit,
Das perfekte Kind, was immer schläft, niemals schreit,
Ich brauch mehr Milch, Mom, give me some more,
Fang an zu Sprechen, mein erste Wort ist 'Jo',
Aufgewachsen in der DDR, 
Reiß' die Mauer ein mit meinem Transformer.
Bin 'n Kind, was sein Papa kaum sieht,
Ziemlich schlau mit 'ner Schwäche für Mathematik.
Und ob sie mich bei Hansa Rostock wohl nehm',
2 Tage später schon Kapitän,
Mag alles was mein Bruder so macht,
Hass' alles was meine Schwester so macht,
Kurz Pause gedrückt, was zu Essen gemacht,
Dann ganz locker das nächste Level geschafft

Geh' nicht mehr zum Training, komm' auf Bräute nicht klar, 
Hab' 'n mieses Zeugnis, komm' auf Bräute nicht klar, 
Bin verliebt, doch mein aller bester Freund macht sie klar, 
Ne Woche später ruft sie heimlich an, 
Fragt mich, ob sie vorbei kommen kann, 
Mein erstes Mal, gleich ist es soweit, 
Es klingelt und sie hat noch ihre Freundin dabei, 
Ich hau' ab, geh' mit 18 nach Manhatten, 
Will nur feiern und vom Dach springen auf Tabletten, 
Denk' ich bin ein Star, alles dreht sich um mich, 
Häng' an der Bar, alles dreht sich um mich, 
Komm' zurück und zieh' nach Berlin, 
Was macht man ohne Abi, Schauspiel studier'n, 
Fast erstickt durch den Dreck dieser Stadt, 
Doch Mission erfüllt, Level geschafft

In der Zukunft ist alles Perfekt, 
Doch fast alle meine Leben sind weg, 
Nichts hat geklappt, weder rappen noch Sportler, 
Na wenigstens hab' ich 'n fliegenden Corsa, 
Bin der letzte Lemming, der nicht gefallen ist, 
Der mit 5 Scheiben altem Brot am Teich sitzt, 
Roboterenten füttert, bin 'n alter Mann, 
Das letzte Level bricht an. 

Und plötzlich steht er da, 
Setzt sich Nachts um 2 neben mich an die Bar, 
Nur Knochen in 'nem schwarzen Gewand, 
Stellt sich vor, reicht mir seine Hand, 
Und keine Chance ihm zu entkomm', 
Das Spiel ist vorbei, der letzte Drink ist umsonst, 
Doch es gibt 'n Trick, ich werd' ihn dir verraten, 
Werde Buddhist, dann kannst' es neu starten

Für ihren dicken Benz sind die Straßen zu eng
Hab zwischen meinen Zähnen Kaviar hängen
Es fällt mir schwer sie beim Namen zu nennen

Werd von Düsen geweckt, Frühstück im Jet
Kann nicht mehr leben ohne ihr Geld
Sie spendet den Armen Russisch Brot für die Welt
Der Traum platzt, als er am größten ist
Denn man soll aufhören, wenn sie am schönsten ist
Sie packt ihre Sachen und muss gehen
Ich muss weinen, wenn ich ihre Zwiebeltürme seh'

Zusamm´ mit all den andern kleinen Schwerverbrechern ausgebrochen
Fängst an zu kraulen, schwimmst alle über´n Haufen
Mit zwei schwarzen Streifen unter deinen Augen
Die letzten tausend, sind zu faul müssen Pause machen
Ein Haufen Kaulquappen, die sich aufs Maul packen
Louis, die Nummer eins ist vergeben
Du hast es geschafft, willkommen im Leben
Das erste Ultraschall-Bild, du bist kaum zu sehen
Auf dem zweiten sieht man wie du versuchst die Faust zu heben
Sehen das dritte, kaufen dein Kinderzimmer
Auf dem vierten zeigst du uns deinen Mittelfinger

Morgen bin ich ´n Schritt weiter

Der große Plan hängt an 'nem Fallschirm und geht nicht auf
Dein Papa riskiert 'ne dicke Lippe, wenn zwei sich streiten leidet der Dritte
Doch ich bring dich zum Fußball, bezahl deine Tattoos
Ach, wenn's sein muss kauf ich dir Ballettschuhe
Und wenn jemand anders will, dass du Daddy sagst
Sagst du einfach mein Daddy ist Marteria
Wenn dein Direktor dich von der Schule schmeißen will

Tut mir leid, du bist ein Teil der Jugend von gestern

Jetzt wohnst du im Reihenhaus, denn du bist willenlos

Es dauert schon bis es vorbei is, doch man is nich so alt wie man sich fühlt

Einmal nich aufgepasst da draußen und es is' vorbei

Nimmst Medizin, um zu vergessen, doch vergessen wirst du nie
Bin nur noch ein Albtraum in deinen grauen Fantasien

Ramm’ mir deinen letzten Nagel tief in meine Hand
Fütter’ den Kamin mit deinen Briefen, nehm’ dein Gesicht von der Wand

Kurzschluss im Gefängnis, Gangs brechen aus
Blaulicht explodiert, Fenster springen raus
Bomberjacken blähen auf, platzen wie Ballons
Lockenwickler drehen auf, geben Glatzen keine Chance
Krawatten von Bänkern klappen hoch wie Ständer
Dieser Tag schwarz angemalt im Kalender
Laternen werfen splitter auf Straßen
Autopiloten lassen Flugzeuge starten
Wenn Merkel mit ihren Kolleginnen aufläuft
Sehen sie aus, wie die Leningrad Cowboys
Strom auf dein’ Körper, Koma vorbei
Trockenhauben grillen, deiner Oma wird heiß

Strom
Strom (Haa!)

Jede Berührung elektrisiert dich
Nur der elektrische Stuhl funktioniert nicht
Das Haargelmonster trinkt Bier durch seinen Hoodie, Volkstanz Nummer 1
Electric Boogie
Jedes Wasserbett wird zum Jacuzzi
Der Glöckner von Notre Dame sieht aus wie George Clooney
Die Welt gehört dir, Casinos verlieren
Er fragt, warum plötzlich ihr Nachttisch vibriert
Rosa Ledersofas und die Federboas qualmen
Das Rotlicht geht an, im Puff wachsen Palmen
Computer fallen aus, die NATO zerbricht
Heut’ gibt’s Döner im Schwarzbrot für dich

Strom (Haa!)

Will da Oben rein, mal sehn' wie ich's mach
Ich will ja gut sein, auch wenns nicht immer klappt
Lauf durch die Straßen im Winter verteil Schuhe und Brot
Mädels und Jungs dieses Leben ist kein U-Bahnhof
Fahr mit 'nem eigenen Wagen über die CSD,
Schmeiß' Gummis in die Menge und schrei „Gay OK!“
Mach was du willst, auch wenns keinen bewegt
Keiner versteht wohn' mit ner Blonden und ner Brünetten in ner dreier Wg
Seh die ganzen Gangster auf der Suche nach Sinn
Millionen Einzelkämpfer wissen nicht mehr wohin
Am Ende des Tunnels sind all die Lichter gedimmt
Und dreht man wieder auf, machen die Lichter uns blind
Unsere Götter sind Freunde, warum sagen sie's uns nicht
Kommt einer vorbei, dann ertragen sie es nicht

Also mach ich mir 'nen schönen Abend, doch kann nicht schlafen
Denn wieso oft stell ich mir diese eine Frage

Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel
Wie komm ich da bloß rein?
Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel
Wo zur Hölle soll der sein?
Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel
Wie komm ich da bloß rein?
Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel
Wo zum Teufel soll der sein?

Will da Oben rein, wie soll das gehen?
Muss ich sein wie Mohammed, Buddha oder Kanye?
Kann die Zeichen nicht sehn, kann kein einziges Gebet
Find einfach keine Ruh doch jeder Beichtstuhl ist belegt
Bin jetzt 30, keine Angst ich heirate bald
Brüder und Schwester stellt schon mal das Weihwasser kalt
Die Welt zu verändern, alles liegt in meiner Gewalt
Will Frieden verbreiten, hab immer meine Pfeife dabei
Seh' die ganzen Emos auf der Suche nach Sinn
Doch ich weiß, ich bin für was gutes bestimmt
Denn in den Goldgräbermienen ist noch genug für mich drin
Mein neues Haus sieht aus, wie der Louvre von innen
Vatikanti mit und Mekka, wir feiern ins nächste Jahr
Zum Dank schießen wir die Silvesterraketen in Arsch

Und mach ich mir nen schönen Abend, doch kann nicht schlafen
Denn wieso oft stell ich mir diese eine Frage

Martha and the Muffins,"Riding our bicycles down on the freeway
Leaving distorted cars trailing behind
We move like bullets, no danger, no danger
We take that for granted

Crossed the bridge, left the network behind
I could feel it in my heart
We gage ourselves and the scenery too
We push on forever and a day

This is the Ice Age

Feeling the trees and the wind on my face
Passing along single file
Might be autumn but we know it's not
Cynosures hiding in the air

All we did was close our eyes
A moment come unhinged
All we did was close our eyes
A world falling into shape

The wind purls over a hinterland of long grass
Gold, where tiny black horses play
Distant mountains move like water
My friend is with me, a familiar voice
An unfinished memory
This is the Age of Innocent Passion

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride

Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Her only answer is one little smile,

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Why do lies make my love stronger

It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I have to try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
There are times I find myself 
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover",Many Rivers To Cross
Martha Reeves,"Oh oh oh I
I don’t need no one else but you in my life
Even if I try I can’t work it out
I’m longing no 1 else but you in my life

Push my feeling, push my feeling
Push it up, push it up, push my feeling
Push my feeling, push my feeling
Push it up, push it up, push my feeling

Follow me now lovers, follow me now boys and girls
Follow me now, follow me now
Follow

Oh oh oh I
I don’t need no one else but you in my life
Even if I try I can’t work it out
I’m longing no 1 else but you in my life

Martha Reeves,"The very first time I saw your face
I knew you were the classic one
We danced and laughed and talked all night
But you had to leave out of town

But as I walked you home that night
The whispers then soon changed
And like a knife right through my heart
Sweet misery again

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

If I believe what I've been told
I'd only be around for a while
You love 'em and leave 'em for less than a song
But they still can't forget that smile

And once I'm safely home alone
I wish you could be here
I want so bad to be the one
To say exactly how I feel

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

I haven't got a thing to give
Except for what you see
Remember this, if all should fail
You'll always have a friend in me

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same",Sweet Misery

Martha Reeves,"Every single time you take me out with you 
You always flirt around with someone new 
But I never criticize the tearful things you do 
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you 

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide 
'Cause I just lock my door and let myself go 
And lay right down and cry 

Every place we go, people are whispering 
About your flirting ways, & it hurts me so to hear 
But in the public's eye I just push behind all my hurt inside 
And pretend i don't mind 

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide 
In my lonely lonely lonely lonely room 
I push my pride aside and lay right down & cry 
In my lonely room, in my lonely room

for the first time I feel alone in life.
As I watched the moon kiss the starlit sky 
I feel the need for your lips to press close to mine.
For so long I been afraid to love, 
but right now I feel the need for love 
and you, you have the love the love I need 
to comfort me oo and I'm ready for love
truly ready for love your wonderful 
sweet sweet love right now I'm ready for love.
 
I've tried to shield my heart from love's tender touch
'cause to lose in love would hurt so much;
but as I softly walk in my solitude
I searched my heart and found there's a need for you.
And for the first time I feel alone,
'cause I need a love to call my own;
and only you, you have the love the love I need 
to comfort me oo and I'm ready for love
I'm truly ready for love you know I'm ready for love 
your wonderful sweet sweet love 
I'm ready right now I'm ready right now.
 
Something wonderful has come over me 
and filled this heart of mine with ecstasy
I'm glad I finally opened up my eyes 
and pushed the fear of love, the fear of love aside;
and for the first time I feel alive
I have the touch of love deep down inside.
And just as soon as I see your smiling face 
I'll rush into your warm embrace.
 
Right now I'm ready for love,
I'm truly ready for love,

Martha Reeves,"It's my birthday, and he forgot again 
Every time we date, he's always late 
All the abuses and excuses, I've made up my mind 
Gonna tell him this time we're through 
But everything I plan to say 
Just seems to fade away 
Every time I see his face 
My eyes light up, sparks start to flyin' 
Like a live wire, real live wire 
Just like a bolt of lightnin', it sets my soul on fire 

Sweet kisses are his alibi 
And that's why, that's where my weakness lies 
Though I plan and rehearse the things I want to say 
The words never never come my way, 'cause
'Cause everything I plan to say 
Just seems to fade away

Martha Reeves,"Love, love, love makes me do foolish things 
Sit alone by the phone, a phone that never rings 
Hoping to hear you say you love me still 
Knowing you never will 
Love, love, love has made a fool of me 
Got me doin' things, things that shouldn't be 
Listening for the sound of your knock on my door 
Knowing that sweet sound will be no more 

Funny how precious memories linger on 
So long after you've gone 
Oh precious memories that only make me cry 
But I keep holdin' on, oh why do I?  Oh, because... 

Love, love, love makes me do these things 
Speak your name softly each night, or holding your picture tight 
When you took my heart, you took my soul 
& it's far beyond control 

Funny how precious memories linger on 
So long after you've gone 
Oh precious memories that only make me cry 
But I keep holdin' on, oh why do I?  Oh, because... 

Love, love, love makes me do these things 
Love, love, love sadness it brings ",Love (Makes Me Do Foolish Things)
