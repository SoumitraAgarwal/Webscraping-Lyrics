Jerry Jeff Walker,"Going gray around the temples
Usually days when I won't shave
Have a habit of tripping over ripples,
And watching them roll in to waves

[Chorus]
I've been too long riding this range
Running wild, without reins
Always traveling against the grains
And pretty girls deserve better
I'm too old to change

Can't say I've been sorry
About anything I've ran off to see
And all the nights that we roared
And going home never dawned upon me

[Chorus]

You better get gone and grow old graceful
As graceful as push-ups can get ya
But some times I look over my shoulder
And smile about what they said about me

[Chorus]",Too Old to Change
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Yeah I played the Red River Valley
He'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run the fingers through seventy years of livin'
Wonder, if every well he'd drilled gone dry?
We was friends, me and this old man
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train

Soon as I could walke'd take me with him
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lying 'bout their lives while they played
And I was just a kid, they all called me Sidekick
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train

Yeah he's a drifter, he's a driller of oil wells
He's an old school man of the world
He taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like, some old Western movie
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men
Just drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like a desperado waitin' for a train
Like a desperado waitin' for a train

The day before he died I went to see him
Yeah I was grown and he was almost gone
We closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
We played another verse of that old song
Yeah Jack you know, that son-of-a-bitch is comin'

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin'",Desperados Waiting For the Train
Jerry Jeff Walker,"He was born in Oklahoma
His wife's name's Betty Lou Thelma Liz
And he's not responsible for what he's doing
Cause his mother made him what he is

And it's up against the wall Redneck Mother
Mother, who has raised her son so well
He's thirty-four and drinking in a honky tonk
Just kicking hippies asses and raising hell

Sure does like his Falstaff beer
Likes to chase it down with that Wild Turkey liquor
Drives a fifty-seven GMC pickup truck
He's got a gun rack; ""Goat ropers need love, too"" sticker

And it's up against the wall Redneck Mother

O is for the Oil I put on my hair

Jerry Jeff Walker,"It's a one, two, it's a one, to, three, yea
Hey, come on in, sit down my friend,
Sure good to see you again.
Put your feet up, there's wine in a cup
And there's no fences to mend.
Haven't seen your smile for quite a while
So just unwind, relax your mind
Let the time go by.

Say, how is your lady,
She still just as crazy?
What the hell was her name?
Oh, Trudy, yea
Remember the night we both got so tight
We never did catch a plane?
We sat and played guitar in that terminal
We sure had a ball, must have played them all
It made the time go by.

You still live upstairs?
Your cats are all there
And your dozen guitars?
They say we all changed
But I feel the same and I know that you are.
They always said we played 'em much too long.
But tell me, what's a song
Don't it carry on and make the time go by?

I live in the west, Texas, I guess
Old Austin's the best.
I?m building a house
Ten miles to the south
The old bird's gonna nest.
The radio gonna play our songs sometimes
And make me smile, erase some miles,
And make the time go by.

Time as we know it.

Yes it's a long old road that we ride down my friends.
Yes, it's a long old road that we ride.
But I know we?ll make it through,
We?ll make it to the end,
Yes, friends, we'll make it, you and I.

Hey, come on in, sit down my friend,
Sure good to see you again.
Put your feet up, there's wine in a cup
And there's no fences to mend.",David and Me
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Jerry Jeff Walker

For your birthday, I thought that I'd give you
A little something from me
A gift you would treasure, something you'd always keep
At first I thought maybe some jewelry
With lots of diamonds or gold
But any man with deep pockets can go and buy one of those

Chorus:
No, I wanted something, something that money can't buy
A gift I could give you, and it would last for all time
So I wrote you this love song, one I hoped that you'd like
And I've wrapped it in a promise, to love you all of my life

These days it's so easy to buy things, no effort needed at all
Anything you desire, all you do is make a call
But I wonder how often it's happened, once you've brought it home
That shiny new trinket now leaves you cold and alone

Chorus:
So I wanted something, something your money can't buy
A gift I could give you that would last for all time
So I wrote you this love song, one I hoped that you like
Then I wrapped it in a promise, to love you all of my life
Yes I promise I'll love you, for the rest of my life





",I Promise to Love You
Jerry Jeff Walker,"My old man had a rounder soul 
He'd hear an ol' freight train and he'd have to go
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
And that's the reason I guess that he'd been cursed to roam
Came to town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was he was lookin' for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places he had been
He talked real easy and he smiled and waved
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played
Makin' people drop their cares and woes
And hum out loud the tunes that his fiddle bowed
Til the people there began to join that sound
And ev'ryone in town was laughin,' singin,' dancin' 'round
Like the Fiddler's tunes we all there heard that night
Like some dream that says all the world is right
Instrumental Break
The Fiddler's eye caught a beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin' golden kind of hair
He played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own
She alone was dancin' in the room
The only thing left movin' to that Fiddler's tune
Instrumental break
He played until she was the last to go
The he stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home
In all the nights that passed a child was born
In all the years that passed, love would keep them warm
And all their lives they'd share that dream come true
And all because she danced so well his fiddler tune
Instrumental break
The train next mornin' blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town
And all that I recall that was said when I was young
There's no one else could really sing those songs he sung",My Old Man
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Django Walker

Skinny young kid who sits in the back of the class
Nobody knows his name, nobody cares to ask
They just sit up front and tell him he won't go far
Not knowing one day he'll grow up to be a movie star

Chorus:
Got to hold your head up high if you're gonna see at all
Got to put your foot above the rest if you're gonna rise at all
Got to spread your wings and fly if you don't want to fall
'Cause it's the road that you choose that'll take you through it all

Now that kid has grown up to be that movie star
Seemed like yesterday people told him he couldn't go far
Tonight's his big premiere; he's got tons of fans
Next week he's on the late show with David Letterman

Chorus

He's older now, he's got grey hair and all
He's got two teenage kids, John and Paul
One of them is having the same problems he did too
He just says son hold on here's what you've got to do

Chorus





",The Road You Choose
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Well I found her in a pawnshop
Somewhere up in Ohio
Where I guess some rounder came up short
And he had to let her go
Cost me ninety dollars
But she's worth much more by far
Cause I never had a better friend
Than that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much

She picked up the name of Angel
In an old New Orleans bar
Where a drunken poet drew one
On the top of that guitar
Old Dave Stovally marked her
Scratched the song right out of his heart
Seems everyone who used her 
Scarred that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much


She traveled with me always 
Through the alleys and bars
Songs I sang and friends I knew
Were part of that guitar
At nights it was my pillow 
Sleeping underneath the stars
Day and night I stayed alive
With that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much


Yeah a ramblin man he has his troubles
Hanging on to all that he owns
After many years of travelin'
That guitar fell by the road
Then one night in New Mexico
I stumbled into this bar
Angel laid there smilin'
On that old beat up guitar

Well I took her from the wall
Ran my hands across the scars
Played again the old songs
That were written on that guitar
Friends I've loved and lost
Many nights inside of a bar
Came back so clearly singing with
That old beat up guitatr

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much

Now she travels with me always 
Through the alleys and bars
Songs I sing and friends I know
They are a part of that guitar
At nights it is my pillow 
Sleeping underneath the stars
Day and night I stayed alive
With that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much",That Old Beat-Up Guitar
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Love will abide, take things in stride
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean, love wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love for a long, long time

Caught in my fears, blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell over, the girls you never knew

'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think It's gonna hurt me for a long, long time

Wait for the day you go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price, I'd have to pay
Life's full of flaws who knows the cause
Living in the memory of a love that never was

And I've done everything I know try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long, long time
'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love for a long, long time
","Long, Long Time"
Jerry Jeff Walker,"In a bar in Arizona 
On a sultry summer day
A cowboy came in off the road just to pass the time away
He pulled a stool up to the bar and pushed his hat back on his head
I listened to the stories told, to the words that cowboy said
He said...

""I could tell you stories 'bout the Indians on the plain
Talk about Wells Fargo and the comin' of the trains
Talk of the slaughter of the buffalo that roamed
Sing a song of settlers come out looking for a home.""

[Chorus:]
Now, the man with the big hat is buying
Drink up while the drinking is free
Drink up to the cowboys a-dead or a-dying
Drink to my compadres and me
Drink to my compadres and me

Well, his shirt was brown and faded 
And his hat was wide and black
And the pants that once were blue were grey and had a pocket gone in back
He had a finger missin' from the hand that rolled the smoke
He laughed and talked of cowboy life, but you knew it weren't no joke
He said...

""I seen the day so hot your pony could not stand
And if your water bag was dry, don't count upon the land
And winters... I've seen winters when your boots froze in the snow
And your only thought was leavin', but you had nowhere to go

[Chorus]

Well, he rested easy at the bar, his foot upon the rail
And laughed and talked of times he'd had out living on the trail
The silence was never broken as the words poured from his lips
Quiet as the forty five he carried on his hip, he said...

""I rode the cattle drive from here to San Antone
Ten days in the saddle, you know, and weary to the bone
I rode from here to Wichita without a woman's smile
The camp fire where I cooked my beans was the only light for miles

[Chorus]

Well, he rolled another cigarette as he turned toward the door
I heard his spurs a jingling as his boot heels hit the floor
He loosened up his belt a notch, pulled his hat down on his head
As he turned to say goodbye to me, this is what he said...

""Now, the high-lines chase the highways, and the fences close the range
And to see a working cowboy - that's a sight that's mighty strange.""
But a cowboy's life was lonely, and his lot was not the best
But if it hadn't been for men like me, there wouldn't be no west",Man With the Big Hat
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Bill Staines

A baby child is born along the highway
A tiny little thing upon the land
An okie with his dreams out on the byway
Lifts the tiny baby in his hand
The woman smiles a little smile of knowing
And whispers something softly in his ear
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growing
Perhaps a word of comfort through the fears.

CHORUS
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
You trust the sun to shine upon the land
You take the little that you know
And you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man.

A tractor makes its way along the fence line
And drops the seeds precisely in a row
If the rains are kind and the winds don't take the topsoil
Before too long the crops will start to show.
The farmer sees the fields around him growin'
He whispers something low beneath his breath
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growin'
Perhaps a word of thanks for all the rest.

Repeat chorus

There's a storm tossed ship tonight out on the ocean
There's a soul somewhere adrift out on the blue
There's a dreamer with his eyes upon the heavens
They're all looking for a way to make it through.

Repeat chorus




",Quiet Faith of Man
Jerry Jeff Walker,"I found a woman in Texas, 
Who liked what she saw in me
Yeah, I found a lady, 
Who figures that maybe, 
There might be a chance for me
Who lady who, 
Is showing me the things 
True love can do

She's a woman I love her, 
I put none above her, 
She's right for me
And none of the others, 
Could ever discover, 
What lifts me when I'm feeling blue
She knows my moods, 
Her love is true blue, 
And she loves me too

Yea, I found a woman in Texas, makes all that I do worthwhile
I found a lady, a little bit crazy, enough to just make me smile
Who lady who, 
Is into the little things I like to do
She can roll with the punches, 
She follows her hunches, 
She bets 'em too
She's off to the races, loves tropical places 
And little bits of snow are cool
She loves foreign cars and small smoky bars, and she loves me too

And I found a woman in Texas, who's strong when she comes to me
Yea, I found a lady who's never too lazy 
To give me little things I need
Who lady who can get her hands little dirty too
She can rock me and roll me, 
Then love me, console me, she can cuss me too
Her friends know she's honest, 
She's loyal and modest,
She knows the proper things to do
She's nobody's fool, 
She plays by the rules, 
Ah, she loves me too
She's a lady

Yea, I found a woman in Texas, who's now such a part of my life
Yea, I found a lady, who carried our babies and pointed the way for our lives
Who lady who, gets me to do the things that I should do
She's the love of my life, she's a friend, she's my wife, 
She?s the song I sing
You may not buy it, but you can't deny it, 
That my life's changed in front of you

And she loves me too

A Texas lady that won my heart",Woman in Texas

Only one I think I will miss 
I can hear your Bassman singin'

Got to give it all we can now 
I believe everything your saying 
Just keep on keep on playing

Put the pink slip in the mailbox 
Leave the key in the old front door lock 
They will find it likely as not

We've got something to believe in 
Before you know it's time we're leavin'

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick

Spending her days on the train.

She's a semi good-looker, but the fast rails they took 'er,
Now she's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.
South Station in Boston to the freight yards of Austin,
From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain.
Now that the rail packs have taken the best tracks,

She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,

Once a highballin' loner, he thought he could own 'er,
Bought her a fur coat and a big diamond ring.
She hocked them for cold cash, left town on the Wabash,
Never thinkin', never thinkin' of home 'way back then.
But the rails are now rusty, the dining cars dusty,
The gold plated watches have taken their toll.
The railroads are dying, and the lady, she's crying,
On a bus to Kentucky, and home that's her goal.

Lots of things there I never knowed
Because of me not knowin' now I pine,

Detour - there's a muddy road ahead
Detour - paid no mind to what is said
Detour - all these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Well when I got to the place where that sign told me to face
Well I figured all of my worries were behind but the further I go
I find more chug holes there in the road, 
I should have read that detour sign

Well, I got stuck down in the mud, 
All my hopes fell there with a thud

Oh, Lord, won't you look what I've found?
Staring me right in the face
Yeah' I'm through being lonely, I'm through being sad

Looked over on the pillow, there lay my lady love
And I thought how much we'd grown to love the life we chose to live
Ain't it funny how things fall in line, when you take what life gives

Music people tell me I need to write more sad love songe
But me and lovely Susan get stronger as we roll along
We let the rain roll off our windows, we let lovin' warm our rooms
And after all we've lost and found, I'm more in love with you

And all the songs I hear these days, they've got no give and take
The lovers always make the same mistakes
But love will ask a man to find a way to try and work it out
Love can please you, but if it leaves you
It can turn you inside out

So I guess I'll go on counting all my lucky stars
'Cause all the lucky people are the ones who really know they are
You can't have what you want unless you dare to see things through
And I got what I wanted on the day we said I do

Well, old Jack the boss, he left at six 
It was, 'Katie, bar the door'. 
She'd pull down that Navajo rug 
And we'd spread it across the floor, 
I saw lightning frame the sacred mountains 
The wooing of the turtle doves 
Just Iying next to Katie, 
On that old Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

Well, I saw old Jack about a year ago, 
Said the place burned to the ground, 
All he saved was an old bear tooth 
And Katie she left town, 
Well, Katie, got a souvenir too, 
Jack smiled as he spit out a big old plug, 
Well, you shoulda seen her coming through the smoke 
She was dragging that Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

So every time I cross the sacred mountains 
And lightning jumps above, 
It always takes me back in time 
To my long lost Katie love, 
You know everything keeps on a moving 
Everybody's on the go, 
Hey, you don't find things that last anymore 
Like a hand-woven Navajo.

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you!",Navajo Rug
Jerry Jeff Walker,"The Dutchman is not the kind of man 
To keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in. 
But that's a secret only Margaret knows. 

When Amsterdam is golden 
In the morning Margaret brings him breakfast. She believes him. 
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes. 
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes. 

[Chorus:]
Let us go to the banks of the ocean, 
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee. 
Long a-go, I used to be a young man. 
Now dear Margaret re-members that for me. 

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes.
His hat and coat are patched with the love that Margaret sewed him.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain,
'til Margaret comes to take him home again,
Through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm.
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name. 

[Chorus]

The windmills whirl the winter wind.
She winds his muffler tighter. 
They sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
He sees her for a moment. 
He calls her name out. 
She makes the bed up, humming some old love song.
She learned the tune when it was very new.
He hums a line or two. 
They hum together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep & Margaret blows the candle out.",The Dutchman
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Last night I fell in love again and I didn't think I could
I thought by now I was probably over that for good
With too much on my mind, too many things to do
Then last night I fell in love again with you
I heard love comes in waves, each one stronger that the one before
But I never thought that was true, 'til I took a real good look at you
It wasn't what you were doing, it was the way I looked at you
Then last night I fell in love again with you
He said a foolish man will take love for granted
While a wiser man might try and let her know
For if love's a seed that's planted in the heart and soul
Then you give it some attention, it has a better chance to grow
Talkin' with a friend the other day, he said his love had slowly slipped away
Because he never took the time, to do the little things you need to make love stay
And I thought of me and you and all the things that we'd been through
Since the first night I fell in love with you
So last night I looked at you brand new and I saw all the reasons why I married you
What a lovely woman you turned into and how lucky I am to be in love with you
And I'm taking time to say just how much I do
'Cause last night I fell in love again with you
And tonight I'm gonna do the same thing too",Last Night I Fell in Love Again

So that's where my head was at, in a book and a funky hat
On the road with Kerouac, searching for the truth
Sometimes I'm amazed, looking back at a certain phase
Wet my thumb and I turn the page, oh, what was I trying to prove?

Chorus:
I just shake my head and I laugh, at a faded photograph
Of a total stranger staring back at me
Now there's no man stranger to himself,
Than the man he used to be


There's a closet full of worn out boots, skeletons and three-piece suits
A million hats and attitudes and very few regrets
And here I stand in faded jeans, an old t-shirt that don't say a thing
And who knows what tomorrow brings, it ain't over yet

Chorus

No some folks get me confused, with someone they once knew
I know the guy they're referring to, but he ain't been round for years

Chorus

I can see it in the eyes, it was a whole other life
Now there's no man stranger to himself
No man stranger to himself, than the man he used to be




",The Man He Used to Be
Jerry Jeff Walker,"When the telephone woke me this morning, I'm sorry was the first thing I said
From that point it get's a bit fuzzy, thinking with half a head
Putting the pieces together, it's shocking to flash on the past
'Cause when you are known as a rascal, you can bet you showed off your ass

[Chorus]
I was so bad last night, I'll be good for the rest of my life
Now I'm telling you and this is the truth
I have finally seen the light
From now on I'm going to act right, I was so bad last night

The harder I try to remember, the quicker my brain starts to hurt
It really is funny, unwadding the money, that's been stuffed in my pants and shirt
But tryin' to make sense of phone numbers, scribbled on the backs of old cards
I guess we ought to be thankful, nobody knows who we are

I was so bad last night, I'll be good for the rest of my life
Now I'm telling you and this is the truth
I tore up the bar, lost a pretty nice car
It's a good bet I ticked off my wife

I never intended to do it, I dropped in for a drink or two
But all of the chicks were so foxy, I wanted to marry a few
The place was more crowded than usual, and everyone there was my friend
Franny and Snake and Bunky and Jake, and somehow the night never ends

[Chorus]",So Bad Last Night
Jerry Jeff Walker,"This is a time to be cautious; this is a time to be smart
This is a time to consider the options, be careful with games of the heart
A time for young fellas to carry umbrellas
And considering the climate, you really might find it
The right time to stay at home

The booze gets your liver, but when you consider
The condition of water, a man really ought to
Abstain for the night and just stay home

It's dangerous out on the freeway, its dangerous out in the bars
Everybody's mad at somebody, it?s dangerous to drink and drive cars

Whiskeys?s bad for your liver, but stop and consider
The condition of water, then maybe you ought to
Find a good book and stay home

AIDS is to real to be foolish, it?s changed all the rules we play by
You can't take chances in other peoples' pants it's
Too risky to just casually try

Now I only smile at our social lifestyle
It all leaves me believing I'd find more relief in
Some Earl Klugh and the refuge of home
So now I turn off the porch light, next I'll unplug the phones
I'll get on my robe and my jammies, a nice fire sure warms the bones

I might write a letter, but what I like better
Is taking my guitar down and playing an old song
That makes me feel glad I stayed home",Time to Stay Home
Jerry Jeff Walker,"This song is a letter sung to a special friend of mine
One who stopped his singing somewhere back along the line
I wondered if he'd had enough of the rip-offs and the jive
Or did he sing his song one night and lose the will to write

It never was a business deal, this thing with your guitar
It always seemed more a dance done deep inside your heart
Tonight I wonder if it's true, like we felt it at the start
That an artist truly does it best when he does it from the heart

It seems to be much more than an art when the art you sell is you
Be careful how you play the game or else the game plays you

In the old days we'd stay up nights and laugh until we cried
You said songs don't belong to us we just bring some thoughts to light

The rule of thumb is never give the truth away to rhyme
And a man can't lie when he tries to sing it betrays him every time
We really write to understand more about ourselves
And if we're lucky maybe then we touch someone else

Well, I just got back from Europe friend where they hung on every word
It made me feel a little better about my chosen line of work
They asked me if I knew you wrote a lot these days
I told 'em all I know is that you rarely ever play

We start out singing what we like and just give it all away
And wind up hating what we play and sit begging to be paid
So let me say in closing friend, I want you to know
I understand how hard it was to let your music go

An artist must decide which parts to leave in and take out
And if he no longer plays the game that's what the game's about",To the Artist

You would even say it glows

Hey little man, you're quite a man,
You make me smile when no one can
And days when I don't give a damn,
You come and you take my hand

And we go walking a long, long ways, seeing what we'll see
Doin' things that can make me smile,
When you do things that remind me of me

Hey, little man,
Understand you're daddy ain't nothing but a guitar man
Living his life the best he can,
Til you came I hadn't a plan
But I've been walking a long, long ways
And there are things I have seen
I learned things that might help you,
Son, when you do things that remind me of me

And you've got your own life to live, it's true
And I want the best in life for you
There are heartaches I could help you through, if you want me to
But if I know you, you won't ask me to

Hey little man, you got to take a stand,
Make up your mind to be all you can
Have a lot of pride and remember
That you're the son of a gypsy songman
When you're walking your long, long way seeing what you'll see
Looking back won't you tip your hat,
When you do things that remind you of me

But hey little man, now, you take my hand,
Walk a little way with your old man
It won't be long before you lead a band
And I'm just one of your fans
And when you're walking a long, long way
Seein' what you'll see
Remember people will smile sometimes
When you do things that remind them of me

How it came to be. . .
In the 1800's they came in buggies 
To meet and trade and buy feed.
They built the blacksmith's shop, then later on
They added the cotton gin. . .

We went on a bus tour, the great Texas honky tonk tour
Here are some snapshots about life on the road.....

Let me tell you 'bout the life I lead
It ain't all it's cracked up to be
Of what you been told, 'bout life on the road

You get clean sheets and a wake-up call

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",Sea Cruise Medley: Sea Cruise/Johnny B. Goode/Peggy Sue
Jerry Jeff Walker,"It's time for a change
I'm tired of that same ol same
The same ol words the same ol lines
The same ol tricks and the same ol rhymes

Days precious days
Roll in and out like waves
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail
I got charts to make I got seas to sail

I'm gonna build me a boat
With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan
Let the chips fall where they will
Cause I've got boats to build

Sails are just like wings
The wind can make em sing
Songs of life songs of hope
Songs to keep your dreams afloat

Shores distant shores
There's where I'm headed for
Got the stars to guide my way
Sail into the light of day ",Boats to Build

Sometimes I think about old Saturday's child
And all the happy times, we were running wild
I was searching for the dolphins in the sea
And sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me
And I look back, I will remember all the good times
All the warm days in the sunshine
Just a little bit of rain

Chorus:
I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through' the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Backing off the North East wind
Sailing on summer breeze
And skipping the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only hear the echoes of my mind
People stop and staring
I don't really see their faces, oh no, only see the shadows in their eyes


CHORUS

Sometimes I think about Saturday's child
And all the happy times, we were running wild

Jerry Jeff Walker,"She is fixed in his mind like the picture
He's kept in his wallet for years
And the image has never been tarnished
By the blood, sweat, and tears
And to him it appears

That the moon is still over her shoulder
And the ribbon is still in her hair
And he can still see her dancing
And music is still in the air

Sometimes he finds it amazing
That all of his children are wed
When their mother is still turning eighteen
And turning his head
She still turns his head

And the moon is still over her shoulder
And the stars are still falling above
And she never gets one minute older
And he is still falling in love",The Moon Is Still over Her Shoulder
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again
Oh listen to the falling rain",Rhythm of the Rain

Jerry Jeff Walker,"We were wild and young and willing to give up anything it took
To get to where we were going, you could read us like a book
Our nights were hot, filled with a lot of lovers and dreams and songs
And mornings mostly found us in places we did not belong

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We listened to the songs Bob Dylan wrote
We sat there stoned and amazed
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
Searching for the perfect line
So here's to the good old days, baby, one more time

I remember Jimmy saying: if he had two blues and a beer
He might get some sleep tonight, give his head a chance to clear
I reminded him of an old girlfriend singing at a bar called Slim's
And I recall him doing lot's of things that night
But sleeping wasn't one of them

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We learned all the songs the Beatles sang
We even tried Purple Haze
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
Searching for the perfect rhyme
So here's to the good old days, baby, one more time

We were wild and young and willing; we still are in some ways
Every now and then we still have one of them good old days
And it makes me proud when I think out loud
About lovers and dreams and songs
And how it always kept me going, and the best ones are never gone

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We learned all the songs by Hank and Lefty
There must have been a thousand ways
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
And all but the very best lines
And even a few of those from time to time

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
So here's to the good old days, baby, one more time",Those Were the Days
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Shadows come creepin' down the alleys,
Lonesome lines the boulevard
Neon flickers to the rhythm of the night,
But this evenin', sleep is coming hard
Down the concrete hallways in this part of town
You can hear the young hearts drowning in thirst for life
The back streets full of mystery, people 
Frozen in their dreams
Too little mercy, too little love, 
Too much night, it's too much tonight

[Chorus:]
The eastern avenue runs level with the river
In between lies the freight yard of boxcar blues
Eastern avenue railway, come on, come on and deliver
This load of tears and this pair of walking shoes
Boy's got the eastern avenue river railway blues
Trapped between him and the city,
He packed a bag and took one south bound over the line
Trapped between him and the pity, he suffers for those unfaithful times
Well, eastbound river railway runs swift and hard
He swears tonight he's gonna take that ride
Jerk a cold steel freight train right down the boulevard
He ain't gonna stop 'til all the loneliness collides
'Cause it's too much tonight
[Chorus (2x)]",Eastern Avenue River Railway Blues

I had that new book with pictures of Madonna naked 
I was checkin' it out
Just then a friend of mine came through the door
Said, she never pegged me for a scumbag before
She said she didn't ever wanna see me anymore
And I still don't know why

I think I'm all right

Now, maybe I'm dirty, and maybe I smoke a little dope
But it ain't like I'm going on T.V. and tearing up pictures of the Pope
I know I get wild, I know I get drunk
But it ain't like I got a lot of bodies in my trunk
My old man used to call me a no-good punk
And I still don't why

You know, just the other night these cops pulled me over outside a bar
They turned on their lights and said, ""Hey kid, get out of the car.""

And now I'm stuck in this cell with a bunch of dumb hicks

Tied all around his neck
He climbed up on the garage
Figurin' what the heck
He screwed his courage up so tight

He headed for the ground

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape

All grown up with a floursack cape
Tied around his dreams
He was full of spit and vinegar 
He was bustin' at the seams
He licked his finger and he checked the wind
It was gonna be do or die 
He wasn't scared of nothin' boys
And he was pretty sure he could fly

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape

Tied all around his head
He's still jumpin' off the garage
Will be till he's dead

Every drop of water shapes the stone

You wouldn't know it by lookin' at me now
Not long ago, I was down for the count and scared

But I found the strength to get over that mountain

Jerry Jeff Walker,"As a teenage girl in Texas, raised on dust and weeds and cactus 
She first saw pictures of the river Seine 
From her window late at night, she'd pretend the stars were lights 
Of the cafes in the St. Germain des Pres 

[Chorus 1: ]
And she longed to see the world, and converse with other girls 
As they laughed and talked and walked along the boulevard 
To float to Paris and the lights in a taxi late at night 
Seems like a leap of faith to make from this old farm 
But she made herself a promise that someday she'd celebrate 
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres 

After college she got married, she worked in theatre and had some babies
Her life took on directions of its own
She became a working mother, she lived her life for others
For her husband, for the children and her home

Then one day her grown daughter said, she was off to Europe and
Have you ever thought about it Mom?
She said of course I used to honey, a lot when I was your age
But I hadn't thought about it much until right now
She remembered the promise, that someday she's celebrate
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres

She sees how quickly life can pass by, how easily a dream dies
You can't just live your life for someone else
So she boards the plane for Paris, she thinks she'll need a new dress
As she keeps that birthday promise to herself

Oh she thought she'd do it sooner, seems so important to her
But life moves on when you're off making plans
But every now and then it happens, a chance appears for you to grab it
That's why this time she just couldn't let it pass
Cause she made herself a promise that someday she'd celebrate
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres

And later take a walk beside the Seine",She Made Herself a Promise
Jerry Jeff Walker,"On a black and white TV, in a dark saloon
I was watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon
And later on I got high and climbed up on the bar
I told everybody there I could fly above the stars

I was in a Dallas disco the night that John Lennon died
And the DJ played ""Imagine"" and everybody cried
I remember a thousand lighters held up in our hands
All we were saying them ""Let's give peace a chance""

Where was I when you stopped loving me?
When did I become history?
There's not many things that escape my memory
Tell me where was I when you stopped loving me?

Every 20,000 years that comet lights up the night
On a blanket we watched it sail across the sky
A moment like that comes it just once in life
It felt like our first time at 11:35

Where was I when you stopped loving me?
When did I become history?
There's not many things that escape my memory
Tell me where was I when you stopped loving me?

I remember when I met you, the taste of our first kiss
I remember your goodbye, but would you tell me this?

We were more than sweethearts,

Don't know how it started,

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.

Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,

Jerry Jerome,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Jerry Jerome,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Your eyes sparkle, oh, how they shine

Don't tell me, you're not in love

Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,

Home, where the trees grow tall

I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

Jerry Lee Lewis,"When John Henry was a little bitty boy
He picked up a hammer in his hand
Looked up at his mama and smilingly said
I want to be a steel drivin' man
Lord, Lord, I want to be a steel drivin' man

Soon John Henry grew up to be a man
And took a hammer in his hand
He could drive steel with either hand
He was a darn good steel drivin' man
Lord, Lord, he was a darn good steel drivin' man

Now John Henry drove an awful lot of steel
He was the best driver in the land
When he'd start in to drivin' down that steel
The sparks would fly to beat the band
Lord, Lord, the sparks would fly to beat the band

One day they brought a steam driver around
On John Henry's face was a smile
Just give me a twelve pound hammer Mister Boss
And I'll beat that driver by a mile
Lord, Lord, I'll beat that driver by a mile

Old John Henry started pounding down the steel
The steam drill was there by his side
They both drove steel for ten hours straight
Then John Henry fell and he died
Lord, Lord, then John Henry fell

Jerry Lee Lewis,"I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

That last long day she said goodbye
Well lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'

Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daaddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to you somehow
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me

Lord I tried and tried, to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you

Jerry Lee Lewis,"I was riding number nine
Heading South from Caraloine
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal an' left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, actin' smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When that evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia, doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow",(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle
Jerry Lee Lewis,"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you",I Could Never Be Ashamed of You

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,

Where in dreams I live with a memory

Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be

And I wore a big red rose

Jerry Lee Lewis,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, big seven-o-seven set to go
But I'm stuck here in the grass with a pain that ever grows
Now the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well now there she goes my friend, she's a-rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver wing on high

She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain",Early Morning Rain

A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog that drives me wild
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me",Mean Woman Blues

She's long gone, now, lonesome blue

Well, she told me on a Sunday
She was checkin' me out
Here it is Tuesday
She's nowhere about

A man needs a woman
That he can lean on
But my leanin' post
Is done left and gone

Yes, she's long gone, now, lonesome blue

Yeah, she told me on Sunday
She was checkin' me out
Here it is Monday
She's nowhere about

A man needs a woman
He can lean on
But my leanin' post
Is done left and gone

Yes, she's long gone, now, lonesome blue

Kiss me once again and hold me

I can't seem to get her off my mind

That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue, so lonely

He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car

He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star

And today he's forty years old going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair
'Cause he ain't got any

He's got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

He's gotta a woman that he's loved for a long long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights

They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high

But today he's forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs
And he ain't had any

And the young thing beside him
He knows she understands
That he's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown. 
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.

I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).

Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.

And, there's but one excuse. 
Now I've told you who she was, and I've told you what she does, 
Still, give this gal her dues. This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere

It's that silver haired daddy of mine.

Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.",Great Speckled Bird

On a hungry white child with no name Reuben James

You said turn the other cheek there's a better world waitin' for the meek

Who could tempt any man

May get a little out of hand

That I'll wake up some day
And I won't be the first

Than the memories you save
After a love falls apart
Think about it

So, darlin', please don't blame me
For keeping what's mine
And guarding our precious love, like I do

I can't help wanting her kisses all the time
I run to meet her like a kid with a dollar
To the corner candy store
It's what I'm livin' for
But I want more than your candy kisses

She starts movin' I say ""Honey please""

That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory

Heaven opens a magic lane.
When all the clouds darken up the skyway,
There's a rainbow highway to be found,
Leading from your windowpane.
To a place behind the sun,
Just a step beyond the rain.

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby,
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me,
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Away, above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me.

Jerry Lee Lewis,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty arms like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask of loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights
Jerry Lee Lewis,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an AvÃ¯ there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy [Mono Version]
Jerry Lee Lewis,"I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home.

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit city,
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home,
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother,
And I dreamed about that girl, who's been waitin' for so long

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit city,
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine,
But by day I make the cars, and by night I make the bars,
If only they could read between the lines

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home

You know, I rode a freight train north to Detroit city,
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time,
So I think I'll take my foolish pride, put it on a southbound freight and ride,
Go on back to the ones I left, who've been waitin' for so long

Oh Lord, I want to go home.",Detroit City

Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating
So here where you left me I'll stay

And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door.

By the banks of the old river Rhine

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Or is he holding you the way I do?

Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

To face the world outside

And dressed him in the latest craze
While he clipped his hair,
You know, she slipped downstairs
And had them rocks appraised
Now she was told they were solid gold
The wheels started spinning around
The morning paper read: ""Ole Herman dropped dead""
And now she's the richest little woman in town.

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my old harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
Blowing low
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
Bobby clapping hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord
When Bobby sang the blues
Lord that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
He was standing right beside me
Through everything I done
Every night he kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
I let him slip away
Looking for the home I hope he'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
And nothing is worth nothing but it's free

Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me

Jerry Lee Lewis,"I know, I am not a model husband
Although, I'd like to be
But payday nights and painted women
They do strange things to me

But when the party's over
And the good is all she sees
Though I let her down, she still comes around
To love what's left of me

Six days out of seven
I work hard at doing right
But believe me, you could set your watch
Find me on Friday night

I'm lucky that she understands
The fool that lives in me
Though I let her down, she still comes around
To love what's left of me

The way that I'm living now
It's a wonder she can take it
That woman's got a heart of gold
And it's killing me to break it

I know I don't deserve her
But I'm thankful as could be

And on my lips I can taste your goodnight kiss
In my room the fragrance of your perfume lingers
And I know there must be more to love than this

I look across my lonely room and see your picture
Your loving smiling face I know I miss, yes I would darlin'
And I remembered to another you're still married
And I know there must be more to love than this

The ringing phone sounds like the doorbell to heaven, whoa lord
Your voice sounds like an angel full of bliss
But I'll go through hell tonight if I don't see you
And I know there must be more to love than this

And there must be more to love than stolen moments
This love it should have brought me happiness
Ever since we started lovin' I've been hurtin' hurtin', hurtin'
And I know there must be more to love than this
Yes I know there must be more to love than this",There Must Be More to Love Than This
Jerry Lee Lewis,"All around the water tank
Waitin' for a train
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain

I walked up to a brakeman
Just to make a line of talk
He said, ""Son if you've got money""
""I'll see that you don't walk""

Well, I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
Well, get off, get off, you railroad bum
He slammed the boxcar door

Well, he put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
Wide open spaces all around me, Lord

My old heart is filled with pain

And I'm waitin' for a train

With your tail tucked between your legs

And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson behind my *Japan* fan

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Now, listen while I tell you 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
'Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Well, now you've heard my story 'bout a place I know

Left by someone who couldnt keep me

She had love that was more than sufficient

I never had a dad to call my own
But as long lord as I can remember
Black mama she made a good home

I'm sure that most folks it looked different
When they saw me upon her old knee
For as I grew up and we traveled around
When they saw black mama and me

To me she's still my mama
I know blood I could never do that
But I had love that was more than sufficient 
By a mama who was black

I received a message of sadness
I ran to her side right away
But before I could speak with her 
Black mama passed away

Today for me neighbors is a sad one
As I stand with my tears running free
Her life here on earth is over

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Jealous Heart, Oh, Jealous Heart stop beating 
Can't you see the damage you have done 
You have driven her away forever 
Jealous Heart, now I'm the lonely one. 

I was part of everything she planned for 
And I know she loved me at the start 
Now she hates the sight of all I stand for 
All because of you, old Jealous Heart. 

Jealous Heart, why did I let you lead me 
When I knew the end would bring me pain 
Now she's gone, she's gone and found another 
Oh, I'll never see my love again. 

Through the years her memory will haunt me 
Even though we're many miles apart 
It's so hard to know she'll never want me 
'Cause she heard your beating Jealous Heart. 

Many times I trusted you to guide me 
But your guiding only brought me tears 
Why oh why must I have you inside me 
Jealous Heart, for all my lonely years.",Jealous Heart
Jerry Lee Lewis,"Well I spent my whole lifetime
In a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions
On the slightest of notions
And the first easy loving I found
But soon all the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away
There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face
Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away",Keep Me from Blowing Away

Oooooooohh don't they play sad

Jerry Lee Lewis,"This house is filled with memories of things that used to matter
But somehow they don't seem to be important anymore
But anyway I'm thankful for the mercy of your letter
At least I didn't have to hear the closing of the door
Do you think it's easier to write goodbye that say it
Or just afraid that I might change your mind
I might think you still love me darlin' in spite of knowin' better
The little hope I'm clinging to is smoored into the lines
Where tears and ink of your goodbye have somehow run together
And covered all the words of love and blatted out forever
Do you think it's easier",The Mercy of a Letter
Jerry Lee Lewis,"The alarm clock woke my sleepin' I lay there for a minute
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain
I stopped that bell from ringing about the times it takes a heartbeat
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again

Terrible truth came staggerin' through my head
Lord there was nothin' that goes on to lay around me
That woman she wasn't beside the Killer in the bed

(It's the mornin' after baby let me down
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found)
Only silence to torment me no soft hands to touch me gently
It's the mornin' after baby let me down

There was nothing to hold on to but the sheets that fell around me
My God I was tremblin' like a leaf
How could that woman leave me she was more than just a lover
Every bit a lady warm and sweet

I can taste the salty teardrops it's gettin' hard to swallow
But a glass of bourbon takes that lump away (yes it does)

Although a million tears start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll miss you, but no one will ever know

I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And realize our dreams could never be
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me

No one will ever know how much I'm pining
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
You've hurt me, but no one will ever know

Will you please take me back one more time

Oh one more time I'm gonna tell you that I'm sorry

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Ride me down easy Lord ride me on down leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy to come easy to go and easy to love when I stay

This old highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides they're as scare as the rain
When you're down to your last shop with nothing to sell
And too far away from the trains
It'd been the good month of Sundays and a guitar to go
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left the long string of friends some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind
So won't you ride me down easy...

A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

Chairs are stacked all over tables and it's closing time they say
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than that old lonely room of mine
And a sleepless night a waitin' for another place, another time

Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
After I've been holding you so close to me

That you're my every dream

Keeps us so far apart

And melt your cold, cold heart

Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start

And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory

The more we drift apart

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Well, the band was on its final break
When he came walking in
The lies that showed more than his age
He was drunk, worn and thin

He sat down behind the ol' piano
And he ran through a couple of notes
And he said, ""Would somebody buy me a drink, boys
To kinda help me clear my throat?""

And he said, ""What would you give to hear a song?
What prize do memories bring?
It ain't every day you get
To hear living legend sing""

I may forget a line or two
A few words now and then
It takes a drink to make me think
And live it all again

This gray you see don't bother Jerry Lee
And neither do these lines
I may have seen some better days, boys
But God knows, I ain't reached my prime

I've got some scars from a woman's war
And playing those one-night stands
Lord only knows, if I had the time
I'd do it all again

Yes, I could still make 'em dance
Like I did in times that's gone
And I can still make 'em cry
And I can touch 'em with a song

I can still yet turn 'em on
The way that I did back then
Lord only knows, if I had the time
I'd do it all again

Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Cruising down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
It's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac",Pink Cadillac

Hot summer night
We lay in the tall grass
'Til the mornin' light

Get the urge to roam

And an old man guards the home

Never gave a second thought
Never crossed my mind

I'm not the judgin' kind

I could take the darkness oh
Storms in the skies
But we all got certain trials
Burnin' up inside

Or silly souvenirs from far away
Don't leave me alone in the twilight

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Well I woke up Sunday morning  
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast  
Wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet through  
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
Than I washed my face and combed my hair and 
Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before  
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched 
A small kid playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street  
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And Lord it took me back to something  
That I lost  somehow somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk 
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dieing 
Half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a Daddy  
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school  
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed back for home  
Somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons  
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

[Chorus]",Sunday Morning Coming Down

And there's not a friend to help you through.

Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues.

Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits.
Yes I've got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my old shoe.

Come on, honey child, I beg of you.
Come on, come on down, you got it in you.

As I step down from the train,
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

The old house is still standing tho' the paint is cracked and dry,
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Then I awake and look around me,
At four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.

California on my mind.
Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh,
On across Caroline.

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,
And we never was a minute late.
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam,
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham.

Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans.

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town.
There's people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State,
The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

Cut your engines, cool your wings,

Thoughts of my baby runnin' through my mind
She's a-waitin' for me, I gotta be on time
I gotta roll

Well, the white marker's flying off the road below
When I'm really flying low
My baby's waiting, I can't go slow
I gotta roll

My dear, will be

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across
The ocean blue

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
And when it starts to sinking
I'll blame you

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you will hear my s.o.s

Maybe you would come back home
My darling, if you knew
How much my aching heart
Is in distress

I'll sail my ship alone

Jerry Lewis,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,

You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,

Jerry Lewis,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart

Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise

That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Jerry Murad,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Jerry Orbach,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee,

You will be hangin' on a string from your

You will relieve the only soul

Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Jerry Reed,"I've traveled o'er this country wide seeking fortune fair
Up and down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I'm going now to the place that's best that old hometown of mine

Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville",Eight More Miles to Louisville
Jerry Reed,"The preacher went out a huntin', it was on one Sunday morn'
It was against his religion, but he took a shotgun along
He got himself a mess o' mighty fine quail and one old scraggly hare
And on the way home he crossed the path of a great big grizzly bear
Well the bear got down lookin' ready to charge
The preacher never seen nothin' quite that large
They looked each other right smack in the eye
Didn't take that preacher long to say bye

The preacher, he run till he spotted a tree
He said, ""Up in that tree's where I oughta be""
By the time that bear made a grab for him
The preacher was a sittin' on top a that limb
Scared to death, he turned about
He looked to the sky and began to shout

""Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
So the good books do declare
Hey lord, if you can't help me,
For goodness sake don't help that bear""

Yea, look out preacher!

Well, about that time the limb broke off
And the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket 
By the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear
And Lord, what an awful fight 
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair
Flyin' from left to right

Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round an' round
The bear he roared, and the the preacher he groaned
He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own!
He said, ""Lord if I get out a here alive
To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray""

Up to the heavens the preacher glanced 
He said, ""Lord won't you give me just one more chance""
So the preacher got away, he looked around
Seen a tree where he'd be safe and sound
Jumped on a limb, turned about
Looked to the sky and began to shout

""Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace 
So the good books do declare

Jerry Reed,"Huh, yeah
Here we come

Well I remember when I was just children
A time when people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singin’ and their big prayer meetin’s
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand

Oh, You talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Oh, if you ever needed help, a friend was there
Some good neighbor, helped lift your burdens
Oh and the simple joys of life your friends would share

But the times are harder and the people are changin’
Today most folks couldn’t tell you, who their next door neighbors are
All the guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain’t this ol’ world takin’ hate and fear just a little too far

Let's talk about the good times, let's talk about the good times
I wish, I could just go back to the days I’m speakin' of
When a friend would meet you and a smile would greet you
What this ol’ world needs now is old fashioned love

Play the guitar
Well alright

Well, my old granddaddy, God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
He said, ""Son this world is so full of hate and venom
An’ I can’t wait to leave this ol’ place and rest on the other side""

""Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
When I’m gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol’ days
We’ll have a big hand shakin’, sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away""

It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain

And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no!

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
The birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life

And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold

I thumbed on down to Panama City started checkin' out some of them all night bars

Got the same old story at them all night piers

I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man show 'em son

I play licks on my guitar like you ain't never heard.

When he pulled out that pack of used cigarette butts.
So that's when I told him 'We can't use you today'
So I handed the boy a dollar and sent him on his way
Well the boss got back and we both had a laugh 
When I told him 'bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around 
About this Mississippi nut that we had in our town.
I said, 'watch him everybody, the boy's squirrelly!
He walks around calling himself the Tupelo Mississippi Flash.'

I just happened to have my car radio on.
When I heard the jockey raving about a brand new smash
By a kid called the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop....Why??

Jerry Reed,"Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the mens just call him ""Sir""

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog,

Well the two men took to fightin'
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog","Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"
Jerry Reed,"Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail

All along the south-bound odysey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no name

And freight yards full of old black men
And the grave-yards of the rusted automobiles
Good-Morning America, how are you?
Say don't you know me, I'm your native son

I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five-hundred miles when the day is done
Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score

Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels grumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers magic carpet made of steel

Mothers with their babes asleep are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good-Morning America, how are you?
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son

I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five-hundred miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee

Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news

The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This trains got the disapearin' railroad blues.

I had me a girl in Waycross, Georgia,

She made me feel I wasn't wanted,

I couldn't stand the way she did me.
Couldn't take her low down ways.
Before I'll stay with a cheatin' woman,
I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave.

Caught her out, Sunday morning,
With some guy they call big Dave.
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia,
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave.

I said: ""You'll pay both you and Davey,
""I'm gonna see you in your grave.""
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em,
I took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller's Cave.

The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted. 

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted 
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted 
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do, 
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu, 
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted.

Jerry Reed,"Alright, watch out

Now my daddy was hard shelled Alabama preacher
My momma was a dedicated Sunday school teacher
My brother went to college and got a PHD
Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said â??Boy you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind

Sock it to me
Well what's that supposed to mean
Boy you just a wild manâ??

Well then one day daddy told me â??Boy I've had enough
Now you just pack up that guitar you just pack up your stuffâ??
So I left home and organized myself a band
Called myself the Alabama wild man

Well I worked all them joints from the east to the west
Never making no money and a-starving to death
A-living on coffee and cold sardines
Soda crackers and pork n beans

But I finally went to Music City USA
Said I'm the Alabama wild man and I'm here to stay
Took my guitar and showed â??em what I'm talking about
So we made a little record and we put it out

With me going
Sock it to me honey
Ha ha hook it boy
Play that guitar

Well now I'm driving the Cadillacs a city block long
The Alabama wild man could do no wrong
â??Cause I'm selling them records
And I'm working them shows
And people love me everywhere I go

But a funny thing happened about a week or so back
I was a showing my home town and the place was packed
Guess who was sitting on the front row seat
Was my daddy grinning up at me batting at me

â??Sock it your daddy wild man
Hook it boy, hook it
Play that guitar show â??em son

Yeah that's my boy alright
Taught him everything he knows
Bought him his first guitar

Jerry Reed,"I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's, where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes, I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ah, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months

Jerry Reed,"Well now, listen people let me tell you some news
I'll sing a song called the crude oil blues
We're low on heat 'n' all
We're low on gas
And I'm so cold I'm about to freeze myself
We got the crude oil blues
Cause the winter time sure gets cold to the bottom of my shoes
Well my hands are shakin' and my knees are weak
But it ain't because of love
It's from lack of heat
I'm gonna tell you a story about this drunk I know
He kept his basement full of homemade brew
But the winter got so bad it screwed up the boy's thinkin'
He got so cold he had to burn all his drinkin'
He's got the crude oil blues
He said the wintertime can sure get cold to the bottom of your shoes
He said, burnin' this booze just destroys my soul
But there's one thing about it honey
When you're cold, you're cold
I've got the crude oil blues
Well, when we made this record there was a little bit of doubt
Whether or not the ting was ever gonna come out
I said, ""Hey chief, you reckon this record will be released?""
He said, ""Son, we ain't got enough oil to keep the pressed greased""
We got the crude oil blues
And son, if we can't make records then we don't need you
I said, ""What am I gonna do if I can't sing and pick?""
He said, ""Well just keep yourself warm playin' all them hot licks""
We got the crude oil blues.

And remember what Albert Einstein said ""That coolin' is conducive to cuddlin'""

Jerry Reed,"Well, if you're one of the millions who own one of them gas-drinking, piston-clinking, air-polluting, smoke-belching, four-wheeled buggies from Detroit City, then pay attention. I'm about to sing your song son.

Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill-will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All  about that demon automobile
A metal box with the polyglass wheel
The end result to a dream of Henry Ford
Well I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready-made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain
I'm a-changin' a flat in a hurricane
I once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf
Well it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam
That makes me the bitter fool I am
But this four-wheel buggy is 
A-dollaring me to death
For gas and oils and fluids and grease
And wires and tires and anti freeze
And them accessories
Well honey, that's something else
Well you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a back-seat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent
Well I figured it up and over a period of time
This four thousand dollar car of mine
Costs fourteen thousand dollars 
And ninety-nine cents, well now

Lord Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well Lord Mr. Ford what have you done

Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a 
Trick to buy, don't you
But the thing that amazes me, I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy
Well now, red light, green light, traffic cop
Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas
Well now, all the cars placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some
Fool pull out to pass
Well now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon monoxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well if the Lord that made the moon and stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born
With a parking space

Come away with me Lucille
In my smoking, choking automobile","Lord, Mr. Ford"

And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I'm only go-going over Jordan,

When the summer sun was sinkin' low
There's nothin' but romance just everwhere you glance
And the native hearts are all aglow
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene
They all stare like a statue out of stone
And when they realize what's before their eyes
The other girls are left all alone

Down in the Caribbean it's not a dream you're seein'
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm
But from miles away you can see her sway
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms

Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky 
Sits a wide eyed monkey on a limb
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble 
Just to try and be like him
He doesn't understand that it's a lady's hand 
That makes a heart feel so sublime
But before too long he starts to sing the song 
And then he gets in the Conga line

Down in the Caribbean it's not a dream you're seein'
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm

But he missed the nicest part of the Caribbean
He didn't see the charms and the open arms

If it comes right down to hurtin' and you'll break this heart of mine

Ven a mi lado cuando sientas frio

Siempre que te asalten las dudas
Y a tu alma desnuda le falte amor
No olvides nunca que cuentas conmigo

Cuenta conmigo en las buenas y malas
Si un dia tu orgullo amanece con ganas
De amar, amor, ven aqui estoy yo

Coro, siempre cuenta conmigo, amor
Jerry, cuenta conmigo en las buenas

",Amor de Colegio
Jerry Rivera,"Amores como el nuestro quedan ya muy pocos
Del cielo caen estrellas sin oir deseos
Deshojar una rosa es cosa ya de tontos
A nadie le interesan ya los sentimientos

Como los unicornios,
Van desapareciendo
Amar es hoy tan facil,
Solo es cosa de un beso
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

Amores como el nuestro cada vez hay menos
En los muros casi nadie pinta corazones
Ya nadie se promete mas alla del tiempo
De sabanas mojadas hablan las canciones

Como Romeo y Julieta,
Lo nuestro es algo eterno
Estar enamorado,
Es darse por completo
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

Como los unicornios,
Van desapareciendo
Amar y ser amado,
Es darse por completo
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

CORO: AMORES COMO EL NUESTRO,
SE ENCUENTRAN HOY YA MENOS

Este amor que nos brindamos,
Merece la eternidad
Por ser tan puro y sagrado
No debe morir jamas

Coro

Es cosa ya de tontos,
Pues que ha pasado de moda
Aquel que da serenatas
O aquel que regala rosas

Coro

Amor es dar por completo
Todo lo que siente el alma
Es entregarse a la vida si es necesario
Del amor nadie se salva
Y eso es asÃ­",Amores Como el Nuestro
Jerry Rivera,"Chiquilla tu eres todo para mi
Chiquilla tan sencilla why tan sutil
Has despertado en mi, los deseos de vivir
Pues muerto estaba yo why tu me has hecho revivir

Chiquilla que romantico es sentir
Chiquilla tu corazon latir
Es una sensacion inigualable
Why nada impedira que yo te ame

Chiquilla tu eres la luz que me ilumina
Tienes esa fuerza que domina
Todos los sentidos de mi vida
Chiquilla tu eres el faro que me guia

Quiero estar contigo noche why dia
Why quiero que sepas vida mia
Que si me dejaras moriria

Chiquilla, chiquilla

Que no puedo negar es q me gustas 
No se disimular, se nota por encima de mi ropa 
Si hablara el corazón, las cosas que mi amor te contaría 
Con solo oír tu voz, podrás saber que estoy por ti perdido 

En cambio tu tan natural, como si no me vieras 
Si acaso es timidez, aunque sea una vez, besame cuando quieras. 

Porque me estoy enamorando de ti, 
Jamas por nadie había sentido algo así, 
Y esto me asusta, me hace sufrir 
Porque me estoy volviendo loco por ti, 
No te das cuenta de lo que eres para mi,

Jerry Rivera,"En su torre de cristal
Sobre el banco nacional
Vive el príncipe de la ciudad

Admirado por demás
Envidiado es lo normal
Con el éxito en sus manos
Quien podría pedir mas

Es un buen negociador
Why un encantador play-boy
Predilecto de la lógica social
Cuatro yates, tres Van Gogh

why en el parking: dos Rolls Royce
Why en su corazón un hueco
Que no acaba de cerrar

why en sus ojos que enloquecen a las damas
Why que ahora siempre oculta tras la gafas
La nostalgia colorea sus pupilas
Why le pinta una acuarela
De momentos junto a ella

Ay, amor, tu me robaste el corazón
Why aunque todo ya lo tengo
Soy un pobre limosnero
Porque no tengo tu amor

Ay, amor, tu te has llevado mi razón
Why aunque nadie lo comprenda
Ahora nada me interesa
Porque no tengo tu amor

En la cárcel de cristal
Sobre el Banco Nacional
Muere el príncipe de la ciudad
Nadie puede comprender

No le importa nada ya
Why los que lo conocieron
Ya no saben que pensar
Enclaustrado allá arriba en su morada
Puedes verlo siempre frente a la ventana

why le hare rayos equis a las calles
Why la busca entre la gente
Why la espera, por si vuelve

Ay amor, tu me has robado el corazón
Why aunque todo ya lo tengo
Soy un pobre limosnero
Porque no tengo tu amor

Ay amor tu te has llevado mi razón
Why aunque nadie lo comprenda
Ahora nada me interesa
Porque me falta tu amor

Ay amor tu me has robado el corazón
Este amor que tanto me condena yo lo llevo
Tan metido entre mis venas

why aunque todo ya lo tengo soy
Un pobre limosnero pero de amor
La nostalgia todo el tiempo
Me acompaña pues mi corazon
Todavía te extraña

why como te extraño amor
Why aunque nadie lo comprenda ahora nada
Me interesa mas que tu amor
En la carcel de cristal sobre
El banco nacional muere

Jerry Rivera,"A ti mi nena, que con solo mirarte
Me basta para ser mis sueños
Quiero que sepas, que mi anhelo mayor
Es poder ser un dia tu dueño

Sabes mi nena, que me paso rondando
Tu casa a esperar que tu salgas?
Ver tu sonrisa, contestando a la mía
Why al fin encontrar tu mirada

Oye nena yo quiero que tu entiendas
Que tu eres la alegría que transforma mis penas
A tu lado todo será distinto
Quiero que estés conmigo hasta el fin de mis años

Sabes mi nena que los días
Los paso pensando en volver a verte?
Solo un minuto, que tu me
Dediques no importa será suficiente

Por ti mi nena yo sería capaz
De robarme la flor mas hermosa
Si la aceptaras, como muestra
De todo este amor que a mi pecho aprisiona

Oye nena mi corazón no aguanta
La espera me atormente mis brazos te reclaman
A tu lado todo será distinto quiero
Que estés conmigo hasta el fin de mis años
",A Ti Mi Nena
Jerry Rivera,"Hablas de repente
Y tu disco suena suavemente
Eres tan distinta cuando vas saltando entre la gente
Por favor, no hay nada mas que amor
La lluvia llueve el mar se mueve
Y cada instante es tan distinto

Como un tonto pensando en ti
Sin saber por que te vas
No, no, no, no me puedes dejar asi
Quedate un poco mas aqui
Quedate un poquito mas, mi amor

Pero no, no me puedes dejar asi
Como un tonto pensando en ti

No, no, no, no me puedes dejar asi
Quedate un poco mas aqui

Como dos amigos, super millonarios bagabundos
Por favor, no hay nada mas que amor

Sin saber por que te vas
No, no, no, no, no me puedes dejar asi

No, no, no, no, no me puedes dejar asi
Quedate un poco mas aqui
Quedate un poquito mas, mi amor

No, no me pudes dejar asi
Asi de repente
En las horas amargas de mi soledad
Quisiera estar junto a ti
No, no me pudes dejar asi

Mira que puedo morir
Sabes que te necessito
Para poder vivir feliz
No, no me pudes dejar asi
Que no que no que no

No, quedate un poquito mas
No, no me puedes dejar asi
Quedate un poco mas aqui
No, si tu sonrisa sin tu mirda
Sin tus caricias yo soy nada

No, no
No me puedes dejar asi
Tan, tan desesperado
Enamorado, ilusionado
No se porque te perdi

No, no me puedes dejar asi
Con este amor que me quema
No, y me confunde los sentidos
Que hasta de mi quisiera oir

En ellas tu veras el verdadero amor

Sin miedo yo me atrevo a luchar

Amor rebelde, ojos claros
Amor que jamás han escondido
Escapándome al calendario

Con tus misterios con tus enfados

Amor, amor de ti, yo quiero ser
Soy arena del desierto
Voy, volando con el viento
Soy, quien va a vestir tu cuerpo
Hoy, con mi piel y mi aliento
Voy, cercando tu cintura
En las tardes tan obscuras
Que, solíamos amarnos

Solamente con miradas
Ven, ven, que quiero amarte
Ven, ven, que quiero hablarte
Ven, ven, ve lo que hoy siento
Cosas que oculté por miedo
Amor no hieras más mi vida
Amor de siempre, amor temprano
Amor que amas con poesía

que no puede dividirse
la promesa que se escribe
con un beso
que lo nuestro será eterno
mientras creas como yo

No hay razón para buscar
refugio en otros besos
sólo tienes que pensar
lo mucho niña que yo te quiero

en la distancia sobrevive con un beso

es para siempre si se quiere de verdad

que te duele todo esto
que las noches para ti
son un infierno
que no entiendes
como puedo estar lejos

Como la fruta del placer
Quiero respirar el aire
Que transita por tu ser
Quiero dibujar mis sueños
Con el suave pincel
De tu querer

Eres la inspiración
En tiempo de desolación
Y es tu mirada que atraviesa mi verdad
Que seria de mi vida sin tu amor
A tu lado quiero estar
Por siempre corazón

Y tus besos son como la aurora del amanecer
Suave y dulce como la miel

Como la luna jamás sería tan bella
Si las estrellas no alumbraran su hermosura
Así sería mi vida sin tu amor
Triste y a oscuras desiertas en las penumbras",Quiero

No te podre detener pero conmigo tú vas a volver

Yo se que entre nosotros jamás nos falto el amor
Pero todo pudo ir mejor, no quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quiero ser algo más y me lanzo por ti
No te va a ser fácil deshacerte de mí

Ahora es tiempo de poder olvidar y volver a empezar
Te extraño, es cierto, es verdad que noche vivir sin ti
Por eso hoy vengo
Pues yo se que los dos podemos volver a amar

Yo creí fácil en el amor que sabía bien, no sabía de sufrir
Y no es así, llego la hora de cambiar
Nunca es tarde no, menos mal que pude
Ver que de mis errores pude aprender

Yo se que entre nosotros jamás nos falto el amor
Pero todo pudo ir mejor, no quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quiero ser algo más y me lanzo por ti

Yo en prision pero mi mente en el callejon
Pensando en mi corrilo why en su enterno bacilon
Me encuentro solo why triste why sufre mi corazon
(Ay dios mio)

Una colilla de cigarro mas, un cenicero que va a rebentar
La misma historia triste why sin final
El mismo cuento de nunca acabar
Why la carcajada de otra madrugada
OoOooooh

Se anulan cuatro paredes, rutina puerta cerrada
Why un carnaval de barrotes bailando sobre mi cama
Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Ya no puedo con la condena que lucho dia a dia
Mi juventud se cubre en un celda fria
Mi alma penitencia, mi vida en agonia
Why es muy poca la esperanza de salir todavia

Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Una lagrima que moje el papel de mi triste carta
Pa' contarle a mi familia lo mucho que me hacen falta
A pesar de todo sigo con mi frente alta
Soy un simple ser-humano que en la sociedad descarta

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar

Una lagrima asomada
Yo no pude contener

Si crucé por los caminos
Como un paria que el destino
Se empeñó en deshacer

Si fui flojo, si fui ciego
Sólo quiero que comprendan
El valor que representa
El coraje de querer

Era para mí la vida entera
Como un sol de primavera
Mi esperanza y mi pasión

Sabía que en el mundo no cabía
Toda la humilde alegría de mi pobre corazón
Ahora, cuesta abajo en mi rodada
Las ilusiones pasadas

Ya no las puedo arrancar
Sueño con el pasado que añoro
El tiempo viejo que lloro
Y que nunca volverá

Por seguir tras de sus huellas
Yo bebí incansablemente
En mi copa de dolor

Pero nadie comprendía
Que si todo yo lo daba
En cada vuelta dejaba
Pedazos de corazón

Ahora, triste en la pendiente
Solitario y ya vencido
Yo me quiero confesar
Si aquella boca mentía

El amor que me ofrecía
Por aquellos ojos brujos
Yo habría dado siempre más

Se vestirá de fiesta

Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo

Donde me cobijo
Tuya es su vida
Tuyo es su querer

Mirar de las estrellas
Que con indiferencia
Hoy me ven volver

Las nieves del tiempo
Platearon mi sien

Sentir que es un soplo la vida
Que veinte años no es nada
Que febril la mirada
Errante en las sombras
Te busca y te nombra

Vivir con el alma aferrada
A un dulce recuerdo
Que lloro otra vez

Tengo miedo del encuentro
Con el pasado que vuelve
A enfrentarse con mi vida

Tengo miedo de las noches
Que pobladas de recuerdos
Encadenen mi soñar

Pero el viajero que huye
Tarde o temprano
Detiene su andar

Y aunque el olvido
Que todo destruye
Haya matado mi vieja ilusión

Guardo escondida
Una esperanza humilde
Que es toda la fortuna
De mi corazón

Volver con la frente marchita
Las nieves del tiempo
Platearon mi sien

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

Where do they go when their
melodies die?

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair

We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue

Then softer than

One day, it called to you
I lost you to

And still the days

Jerry Vale,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Jerry Vale,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me

I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire

Jerry Vale,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name

And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Jerry Vale,"Is this the little girl I carried?
Is this the little boy at play?
I don't remember growing older,
When did they?
When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall?
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset, 
Swiftly flow the days.
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset,
Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,
Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.
Is there a canopy in store for me?

Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.","Sunrise, Sunset"

Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea
He alone decides who writes a symphony
He lights every star that makes a darkness bright
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night

He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer
Saint or sinner call and always find Him there
Though it makes Him sad to see the way we live
He'll always say, I forgive

He can grant a wish or make a dream come true
He can paint the clouds and turn gray to blue
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend

He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
He knows every lie that you and I have told
Though it makes Him sad to see the way we live
He'll always say, I forgive

O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

Do you mean what you are saying
Or is this a little game we're playing

If I'm fool enough to see this through
Will I be sorry if I do
Should I believe my heart or you

To tell the story of how great a love can be 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea 
The simple truth about the love he brings to me 
Where do I start? 

Like a summer rain 
That cools the pavement with a patent leather shine 
He came into my life and made the living fine 
And gave a meaning to this empty world of mine 
He fills my heart 

He fills my heart with very special things 
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings 
He fills my soul with so much love 
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely 
With him along, who could be lonely 
I reach for his hand, it's always there 

How long does it last? 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day? 
I have no answers now, but this much I can say 
I'm going to need him till the stars all burn away 
And he'll be there

Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Jeru the Damaja,"Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth
Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like abel and cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like john gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chillin, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? nothing
What's, the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another queen without a king
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the god we trust
The days blow by like dust
Even men of steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, caniballistic, behavior
Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? you must discover
The power of self, know thyself, or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for

Jeru the Damaja,"Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called, on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough
Homicide central, East New York
Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime
Used to get, tax free loot, all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because
I'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel

Before trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose
Dirty rotten since the days of the deuce
Dirty, because of the skin I'm in
The fact I have melanin automatically makes me a felon
Even though I'm righteous, rotten's what you're yellin
But I'm not chain-snatchin, or drug-sellin
According to your books you said I would be damned like Ham
Scoundrel opposite of the king that I am
But wanna get funny, we can get bummy
Take you to the East and back again money
Filthy putrified trick, step past your sister
Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be histo - ry
Mortal Kombat fatality, the original don't sing no R&B
Nasty MC deity
Chop off domes with the poems that come out of my pin-eal
Gland, as I expand, you know who I am

Father of all stylin, I be whylin on wax
We hack shit up like big ax and little ax
Don't need tokes to make you jump like bungee
Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy
When I come through I clog up your sewer
Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure
So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter

But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches

Now a queen's a queen and a stunt is a stunt
You can tell who's who by the things they want

Most chicks want minks
Diamonds, a Benz
Spend up all your ends
Prob'bly fuck your friends

High-post attitudes, real rude with fat asses
Think that the pussy is made out of gold
Try to control you by slidin' up and down on the wood
They be givin' up sex for goods

Dealin' with bitches is the same old song
They only want you 'til someone richer comes along

Don't get me wrong, strong black women
I know who's who so due respect I'm givin'

While queens stand by you, and stick around
Bitches suck you dry and push you down
So it's my duty to address
This vampiress
Givin' the black man stress
Recognize what's real and not material
Or burn in hell, chasin' Polo and Guess, dumb bitches

I'm not talking about the queens
But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches

My man had a chick an' thought she was finger-lickin'
I knew her style that's why I'm vegetarian
I told him she was out to get what she could get
He didn't believe me, so she bagged him up in the end
Made the pussy do tricks then she sucked his dick
He got caught up in the grip now he's payin' the rent

Black Widow: she even killed dead presidents
That he'd owe. Shouldn't have got one red cent
I body slam her But I'm not a misogynist
When I see a brother gettin' nabbed it makes me pissed

Cosmetic enchantress scandalous temptress
The way my man went out you'd think she was a pimpstress

Bitches come my way, I make 'em hop
Cause I'm hip to the game
I'm not a slave so I don't get pussy-whipped
Bear in mind you'll lose em' to end material riches

I'm not talking about the queens

Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches

You've been ho-hoppin'
You've seen them pop up in every spot that I'm in

Could get your butt naked

So your man got a Lexus
You live in the projects
Tryin' a flex but you ain't the smartest
Your ass ain't the fattest
Fuck around, play yourself and get dissed
I know your status, you can't touch my status
Deep down you want this
Dyin' a be famous but you can't attain this

Poppin' that coochie for Gucci

Jeru the Damaja,"It started on the sands of land of the mother
Word to mother, king like my father
My style survived slave ships, whips, and chains, hardships
Still through all this the praise roll off my lips
Bring your guns, chains and tone force your religion
On me cut my hair, the vibes still exist
To destroy the molesters of my heritage
But they conceal the drums of evil, my loyal lineage
King of kings, God of gods
Like my ancestors drums I beat the odds
More mics killed than slaves during the middle passages
Who rapes and ravages and calls us savage?
Jungle bunny, I'm not mo' funny, I'm mo' deadly
They know one day we'll learn how to use it
That's why they fear our jungle music

We went from pyramids to the ghetto
Still my sounds make devils tumble like the walls of Jerico
Chant my paower to devour all the snakes and rats
Extrasensory perception to avoid all traps
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord
In the sancuary of your caves white kids press record
As my mystic music spread from sea to galaxy
It's inevitable, you can't stop me
Try to carbon copy, but it always comes out sloppy
You can't outrap me, you can't outrock me
Like the dreads on my head, you try and lock me
Down underground, but I bounce to the jungle
Melodies, that flows like the breeze
Through the trees, like my forefathers, command the wind and seas
With my jungle music

Unga bunga binga
Sound warrior, I'll take your head more than a rap singer
Enlightener, with the mitre
Make the forces of my nature smite ya
Over the airwaves, powers are released
Holy music destroy the savage beast
I'll beat the devil like a Niyabini drummer
Beasts his drum, this beat will drum through the summer
Try to hold us back with all the strength you can muster
You'll hear a sound similar to the one Custer
Heard before he got ambushed, you'll get ambushed
For taking this back to Kush
For too long you've abused it
On the low used it, and called it jungle music",Jungle Music

Bring your hypest man in your army another casual-ty
Slow like demise I crept on those that slept
Droppin my rhyme science like I'm Imhotep

Made fools scatter, rhymes fatter, minds splatter

Don't molest no shorty still in all, I'm dangerous

Take more heads than Santa Claus at Christmas
Science misfits, meet the wrath of my wit

Reach into my bag of darkness and spark this like an arsonist

Freestylin me g, I be buckwilin

Dirty rottens comin thru punks cling to their guns
Dont start none, there won't be none

Slither like a snake, still you can't elude
The neba, but not caneza
Its the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
Neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
This is my house and I'll evict ya
Big respect is automatic black

I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
I got the game & fame she got the condoms
She's a victim, you shouldn't have that mouth dirty rotten
And for the longest we knew you were plottin'
On the down fall, who stands tall, lick the balls
Im not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
On the low, oh no, on the high
I get high, praise to the most high
Tried to battle me, step up & die
Like the arc of the covenant I electrify
Petrify, intelligence I glorify

-------

I heard some MC's want to bring it
But a female is one of their strongest men
When I step to you don't seek refuge
Make it happen, fuck the rappin'
Because I know I got that sewed
The first time I ever touched the microphone it glowed
Now I explode, eruptin' like a nigga that drunk too much
But not intoxicated...
As mental stress increase you'll need to be sedated
Sick and tired of the izm schism
This time's a warning, after this we take it to pugilism
Mash out the beedies, dreads spark up the corn
I flow muddy like the gutter after the rainstorm
My mission to seek, build or destroy
Like Deadwood Dick, I be the Black Cowboy
And this is the showdown...

Chorus

""I got the wild style..."" / ""Black Cowboy""

Verse 2
-------

After this MC's will wish to do battle with me
For their sake I hope that they apply the proper strategy
In any case, worst comes to worst I'll be the best
Storms will come, this we know for sure, but can you stand the crash test?
There's no vest or no way you can get suited up
For what's about to happen, you might as well get zooted
I heard that ignorance is bliss, so I guess you're all blistered
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
And just in case the first time you missed it
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
Livin' on a diet of flesh and Mistic
I kicks the ballistics and keep it realistic
We shoot shit up like the Hatfields and McCoys
Perverted monks, the Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

Repeat chorus

Verse 3
-------

It's a cryin' shame what some niggas'll do for fame
When they think they know the game
But I switch up the rules of the game
Drops jewels in the game
The fluid is quite fatal, like water on the brain
I be the Sheriff and I got MC's on the chain gang
Continuous hard labour until the day that they hang
One outlaw tried to escape but I murdered his gang
Right back at ya bitch-ass just like a boomerang
Or a bolo, you couldn't knock me out with Apollo
The god is never chillin', hot like a volcano
Once I met up with this bandolero
Why'd he make me bust him in his head with his banjo?
I put MC's on the ceiling like Michelangelo
Did the Sixteenth [Sistine] Chapel
Known to kick and grapple, so you couldn't test the Real McCoy
The Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

I put them hoes in a row and turn out Queens no doubt
Don't need a vest, but flow freely like bullets through shootouts
I be the real supernatural, so check it out
I was concieved in the center of an inferno
The ninth month I slipped out my mom's vaginal
Cavity, now I'm surrounded by creeps and freaks
Had to watch my back in the New York streets
Fly, like an aeroplane, more powerful than the engine of an A train
Won't stress my brain
You know the fame that has men sold and bought
In a single bound, I let the criminal court
Walk through the desert and won't perspire
Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire
Use the opportunity to call the devil a liar
And I won't stop flipping shit til I'm forced to retire
Because that's how I'm living

I can stroke all night and not bust a nut
Swim through a sea of razorblades and not get cut
When I do my thing I aim for the gut
And despise those nasty guys that hit shit in the butt
Blaze like spliffs even back in the days
When I bag shit up like trays, nowadays
I bag 'em up like dimes and not even the Devil
Can stop me cause it's matter under mind
I'm fucking up your mind like a hallucinogen
(Are you hot, Lord?) I heat it up like halogen
Burn MC's, their children, and their children's children
Reverse polarity and make your girl's hell heaven
More intelligent than MacGuyver
Quick to pull off on a stunt like an Indy car driver
Thoughts too intense, brainwaves cut like barbed wire
Since Run's a reverend, sucker MC's call me sire
Push for my mental forces to crush your fortress
Signals of stress, your whole squad's put to death
Bring your white Superman and I'll rip that fucking S off his chest
Cause that's just how I'm living

I dedicate my life to taking snake heads
I break on the beats like scissors break on my dreads
Instead of eating beasts and living savagely
I aspire to excel to the highest degree
Of living, now how you living, like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Me? I keep it tight and lock it down like a virgin's pops
>From crack rocks to suburbian spots I'm hot
Don't forget or have you forgot that I'm a surgeon, Ak-
Bar, once outran a jaguar
Slept in a lion's den and escaped without a scar
Close my eyes and comence the star travel
Fred Flintstone's out a job because I turn hard rocks to gravel
Babble, never, control the weather
Like a few jams back, whatever's, clever
Even the rudest of rude can't test because I'm protectes
With the Breastplate of Righteousness
And that's just how I'm living",How I'm Livin'
Jeru the Damaja,"Verse One:

Police all on my dick like I shot somebody
Cause of these big ass lips and I rock my locks knotty
Life is getting hectic Tupac got shot in the nuts
You saw cops was corrupt when Rodney King got fucked up
With friends like these who needs enemies
Constantly harassing, filling up my nuts like a Klansman
Snatching up a nigga for nuttin I heard bad guys wear black
So I guess I'm the motherfucking villain
Under pressure they got me under pressure
What's your name your address and phone number
Your occupation come down to the station
There's been a robbery they claim a nigga fit the description
It can't be, so I slides out on em
In ninety-five you gotta catch a nigga, if you want him
One to three, and five to ten
Bullies in blue suits Son with automatic weapons
I'm stressed, ready to blow up somethin
The beast keep frontin, invasion

Verse Two:

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
or locked down upstate, when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
but got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot til one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin somethin
But you ain't sayin nothin, invasion

Verse Three:

Come up in my cipher best believe I'ma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin slugs, driving stolen automobiles
skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shit or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
for a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
'cause in the conrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator
Break out from oppression, my mission to escape
The, invasion",Invasion
Jeru the Damaja,"Party people, in the place to be
From the same man, who brought you Da Bichez
(Da Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez)
We were misunderstood, last time we brought you
Ba Bichez (Da Bichez Da Bichez)
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind
like this...

Now a queen's a queen, and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her, eventually spendin up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit
She likes to trick em, cause ain't nothin like a sleepin victim
East New York style stick em -- ha ha ha, stick em
Top rated game, but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated
She claims she loves my mind, cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil inten-tion, to de-plenish the fund
She tried to juice me with the pussy cept for, the mask and gun
I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil ge-nius
She had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin I whip, and suckin up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper

Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin that they'll get drunk off Moet
or Cristal, but that's not my par-ticular style and taste
My name ain't Puff and I ain't got loot to waste
I ain't got time to waste, bad bitches is all up in my face
Crazy ignorant, sweatin links minks and shit
Cosmetic, but deep down, derelict
Fake players, never get out the projects
It's pathetic -- the way she bends for dividends
I tried to jewel her but she tried to get a drink at the end
of our con-vo-sation, I did not have the patience
Slid off to the next Asian
She said, ""What you do?""  I said, ""What?""
She said, ""You know your occupation?""
So I broke the fuck out
In nineteen-ninety-six that's what it's all about, but
I won't go that route
Back in the days Biz said it was The Vapors
But today, I realize that it's the papers

""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""

Now a whore's a whore, find a queen and she'll be my Earth
Respect love and protect her, for all that it's worth
I admit I have flaws, I flips it first, but deep down
I wishes to give em the universe
A lot of the ones that I thought was right wasn't
I build with Afu, he said ""Don't sweat it cause
they come a dime a dozen""
Like my ex-stunt, wanted a diamond
Bitches love power, while queens, love refinement
Low stress environment, old age and retirement
Never have to wonder where my money went
Where my honey went, is her back gettin twisted
by the next fella, always take heed to what I tell her
When I'm wrong, she lets me know I need correction
When I'm right she's my reflection still we, use protection
Through thick and thin, thin and thick
She's my diamond in the rough not a whore or a trick
Great expectations, of me and she buildin nation
Everything we do and skyscrapin
Back in the days, the devil used to rape her
Nowadays, he got her chasin the paper

""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams

",Me or the Papes
Jeru the Damaja,"One day about six 'o clock I'm woke up
By the sound of my buzzer and a car or a truck
Screechin' off, so I jump up, scratch my nuts
But when I'm like ""Who's that?"" nobody speaks up
So I go to the door there's a note it says:
""We have Hip-Hop hostage with guns to his throat,
Do the right thing and we might let him go,
But if you call the police, that's all she wrote
You know what the motive is, it's all about dough
And in case ya think we bullshittin' here's the photo.""
I couldn't recognize the clows because they was all hooded down
But I peeped Foxy Brown sippin' Cristal in the background
With fake alligator boots on
And smack dab in the middle was hip-hop with a Versace suit on
I immediately called Primo
I said ""Hip-Hop is in trouble, meet me at my rest on the double
Don't even jump in the shower, matta'fact scratch my rest
Meet me and D & D in an half an hour
And bring all ya shit wit' you 'cause you know what we got to do.""
Yo Afu! (Whassup?) Lets jet-son like Elroy
If I recall correctly I last saw hip-hop down at Bad Boy
We'll see if Puff knows whassup
'cause he's the one gettin' him drunk and fuckin' his mind up
We go to the office, he's nowhere to be found
So we snatch up Jay Black and beat his bitch ass down
""Now where's Hip-Hop?!""  ""Aaight, aaight..."" he confessed:
""Suge came and took him from Puff last night,
He said he'd give him up if a real nigga came to retrieve 'em...""
So we went to L.A. later that evenin'
When we got there, everything was aaight
And we brought Hip-Hop back home that night.

Verse 1 
It's been awhile since I escaped the library 
fightin ignorance everyday its gettin weary 
when I think I got him 
he pulls a slip on me 
and theres so many soldiers 
in his fiendous ass army 
One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology 
the last time we met, he got the drop on me 
shit happens so fast he even got some of my family 
blasted my way up out the building 
when I catch him Im gon kill him 
track him uptown, where I hear he's lyin to children 
1-2-5th's the stop, go outside I hear gunshots 
run up the block 
greedy Lou's dead infront of the materialistic crack spot 
Trick's yellin out this is my block 
I would've hit him, but I didn't have a clear shot 
an innocent bystander might get popped 
Damn....a small thang cuz the prophet still cant be stopped 


What...thats right, this is my motherfuckin life 
Trick-nol-ogy, you know what Im sayin 
you know me, you can't front on me.... 

Verse 2 
Im in a fucked up position 
but if he squeezes again, Im gon lift em 
a few seconds later now here comes the siren 
oh shit its the pork chop patrol 
their on Ignorance's payroll 
and they only came to hold... 
Tricknolog down, scoup Greedy Lou off the ground 
throw him in the back of a truck 
one yells 'What the fuck nigga ya lookin at? 
now get the fuck outta here' 
then I get that feeling that I feel when danger is in the air 
then out of nowhere one yells the Prophets over there 
immediatly following mad led is in the air 
picture all posted up like they knew I'd be here 
I'd go for what I know 
but shit there everywhere 
through in the back and forth my gun gets lost 
but I managed to get one high powered thought off 
I split 6 pigs that got sawed off 
as their bodies break south I proceed to break north 
now shit is lookin dim and you'd think all maybe lost 
but the Prophet won't go out at any cost 
You could never stop the prophet.... 

>Unit's 1 &2, Unit's 1 & 2 the prophet has been sighted 
>if you see him kill him 

can't a damn thing stop me 

Verse 3 
I head toward the train station 
my force did stop most of the ammunition 
still I need medical attention 
but Im not bitchin ,gettin Ignorance is my mission 
all of a sudden Greedy Lou comes creepin 
around the corner talkin bout..Prophet your a gonna 
We knew you followed Trick uptown because you wanna 
get rid of Ignorance but that dont make no sense 
He runs the world I know this from experience 
Why don't you come & work wit us 
you'll see the boss' game is nice 
that night...Greedy Lou died twice 
Now I'm wanted, pork chop patrol has a warrant 
but that still can't stop the Prophet 

>Here ye, here ye the court of Ignborance is now in session 
>we, judge and the jury find the Prophet 
>guilty in the murder of Greedy Lou 
>one of our close personal homeboys 
>so for that the sentence is death

(Verse 1)
There's a hole in the ozone layer
I'm rippin vampires
You think I give a fuck
Who's the biggest player
Or who's got the fattest bank roll
What is it if a man gains the world
And lose his own soul?
Bioengineered, mutated chickens
Niggaz lickin' one another
Brother killin' brother
And you demon muthafuckas
Start coastal rivalries
The worlds greatest lust is jewelery
Mind Jah lick you with disease
So I inflict MC's like Ebola
Or some other man made cancer
Fuck a two-hundred dollar sweater
We need to try and reach the niggaz
On the corner
But all we do is create drug dealers
Envy then creates murderers
Diamond rings, pretty hoes
Fat chains, expensive things
Just watch which way
Ya burner swings in this world of...

Chemical warfare
The telephoner acts like he lives here
The government is putting madd shit in the air
Projects are strategically set-up
In the case that shit you up
They easily blown up
Poisonous gases
The so-called righteous help for the masses
But it's them that judge their own asses
Knowing what their task is
But still receding, ass backwards
Do you need to ask me who the devil is
Some may call it showbizz
I just call 'em hipocrites
'Cause they don't teach the children shit positive
Like how a man should live
They only focus on the negative
So they're stuck in the ghetto
While you drive a car and got a condo
It's all for the dolo
It's killing your own people
profits greater than (?Peneco?)
Forget about what's equal
In this world of...

White bitches have babies most black youth are incarcerated
In the ghetto babies having babies but no loot
So most pregnancies are terminated
Warlocks keep the covernant
And the souls of the ignorant ones empower it
It's transparent
You see Uncle Sam as your parent
When Amerikkka has beef you jump up to defend it
But you can still be a defendant
Ask my co-defendant
And we're both innocent
Every black man in Amerikkka faces imprisonment
Ridicule, and torment
But in this tournament
The chosen few shall be triumphant
And the devil will be decapitated
So you can keep your (?duckets?)
And your (?dressing?), I won't be emasculated

Unfortunately that's all that surrounds me
So I come to crush the un - stable structure
It's the return of the dopest Brooklyn motherfucker
To ever, ignite the mic, get it right
Mad respect, pimps grap your hoes
Punks grab your checks
What's next, pure nonsense and the style ya flex
And your so bloody pussy, you need a co-tex
Latex cause they're drippin vaginal juices
So many so called gangsta niggas and their booty producers
Now watch the act that's vanishin
Gold and platinum, but who gets the publishin
Not to rub it in, drop it in your box, now your dubbin
My company fucked up my projects momentum
But I'm still winnin
Cause I'm a winner
Came to the table with snakes they had snakes on they're plates
Plus niggas on they're plates, they put figures on my plate
I took the loot unscathed
Cause I couldn't dine wit em
See 17, age 19 (?)
On a podium, at this time you are rewindin
And like solar and lunar, you're clockin
It's to perverted

It's too perverted, you heard it

So deep, that it becomes fossilized
Too many times I find my style between mcs inside
(?), but they swallow their tongues like seisures
I pierce flesh and strike nerves like acupuncture
Or acupressure, feel the wrath of my mathematics
Kinetics, you need a local anesthetic
Cause your system has acquired an imune deficiency
Overwhelmed by my telepathy, no sympathy
Cursed (?) but graceful like calligraphy
And  (?) like (?) was not to mc
Life givin, yet I'm still deadly
And before you step to me
Remember it's too perverted

It's too perverted
It's too perverted, you heard it

Master rhymin so I'm steadily climbin
I rip through mics like when my dick strikes the hymen
Total controller, some claim to be bolder
But they rotate around the lunar
I keep it solar, polar
Who vibrates and radiates
Thunder, lightning, earthquakes from north to south
East to west test the best get sprayed
Drop jewels, burn papes, till my ride escapes
Akward flow to some it's even unorthox
Bone crushin, life threatnin like the jaws of a crocodile

And I told her she could stay

Ayo...(what's up?)...there's a lotta motherfuckers out here
with a style similar to mine nowadays, you know what I mean?
(For reals)  Be tryin' to like...they infiltrated the camp,
and now they, they want to take the style and claim it for they
owns, ya know?  (That's how you feel?)  But I'mma blow'em up,
'cause it's just like, whatever, you know what I'm sayin'?  (Whatever)

First Verse

It's too strategical and mathematical
I rotate so fast that I appear invisible
I keep it chemical, but never subliminal
The force centrifugal and spiritual
You got static?  Get grounded, 'cause I've mastered electrical
Mostly mental, but don't sleep on the physical
Ignorance got'em chatterin', one even said I was a son to him
Still my LP is fatter than
his or yours, took a two-year pause
Now that I'm back on the set my foes drop like hoe's drawers
in a brothel, only dealin' with what's logical
Applied science left MC's penetrable
The leader's stroke is apocalyptic
Hostile like Arabics in Israel with automatics
And if you want it, the Monks can make it hectic
Set it off, fire burn up Jack Frost and Santa Claus
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

(Unknown): ""And to all y'all crews...whatever""

Second Verse

Bound to blow up, but never disintegratin'
The ultimate MC equation
Ferromagnetic, ask my pops, it's genetic
That's why I'm a weedhead and not an alcoholic
Call it whatever you want to call it
Devils just know that it's some form of arithmetic
Hieroglyphic, 'cause you can picture this shit
The state of hip-hop today is like hookers in politics
Got MCin' locked down like a convict
Blowin' up opposition as I maneuver through it
And to make sure it's overstood, I stick around
Popular like crime in ghetto neighbourhoods
Rock my crown like Shaka did, hold it down
Fuck your mind up like Joe Jackson, kids, check it out
So whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Lord Finesse: ""I gotta do my thing...I represent""

Third Verse

Fire, flames, heat up the competition
Spontaneous combustion, like the Pope's religion
your style of emceein' is Paganism
Your rhymes make no sense, just like a Roman Christian
But your niggas soup you up like Lipton
The Gwong Jan Lin of underground emceein' strikes again
The snake bites again, but I'm immune to the poisonous
venom, ask the devil, he knows I'm dangerous
Freak on the mic, but not sexual
Call me unalike 'cause my rhymes are never homo
Make you sad, like when Cher left Sonny Bono
Fire burn Giuliani, Pataki and Cuomo

Whatever, whatever, whatever

But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South

You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant

Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission

Microphone thugs flip keys and shit
Remember the 80's when niggas was acting crazy?
The mean streets raised me
I used to live dangerously
Admist crack-selling armed dangerous felons
Plus murderers, drug spot burglars
Niggas doing anything to acquire that paper
Live the life of crime but got saved by the rhyme
Peace to all my niggas doing time on top of time
Plus the ones gunned down in their prime
I made it this far because of divine design
Diamond chains the sun still outshines
I get you drunk off my drink like that champaigne wine
As long as there's breath left, I father the fatherless
If shit was real Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it
I do this for me, and not the paper, strictly 100%

(""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
 See what I mean black? I gets the paper"")

It started way before Super Rhymes
Peace to mom dukes for enduring hard times
God bless all the victims of my past life crimes
I do this for the ghetto youth living like Good Times
Flipping rhymes saved me from the obvious traps
In '97 studio hustlers puch crack on wax
And breaking backs, but faking jacks
If it wasn't for contracts, they wouldn't bust caps
So, destroy your people and collect huge stacks
Fat axe, and platinum plaques
Come bring it back, rewind it that old gangster bullshit
Got the youth running around criminal minded
Not a player hater, just don't chase the paper
Got a little deal so some heads caught the vapors
So stupid motherfuckers throw your guns in the air
To all my niggas that ain't make it past their 19th year
I do it for me, and not the paper, stictly 100%, nah mean?

(""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
 See what I mean black? I gets the paper"")

Sinister plots, every week who got shot
Spots like the Enterprise kept the neighborhood hot
Niggas bugging out so some receive toe tags
Resting up north with fag or sporting shit bags
When I think back it's so sad
All the niggas that I had, who'd ever figure that it'd get so bad?
So I retreat with a pen and a pad
Hide your chain when you ride the train
For writing rhymes about automatic weapons
I'd rather steer the youth in the right direction
Drop a bomb, destroy the temple's ?sen section?
Little girls already sexing
Hard rock shorties is flexing
But I stick to my lessons, no stress
Cause if shit was real, Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it

Jeru the Damaja,"It's the sinister sister, leave mics so hot make hands blister
Try to catch me but all you heard was ""Damn you just missed her""
Daily means and whereabouts, more secret than a whisper
Cut sharper than a scissor, lookin for the love elixir
Like most listeners, let them know it's all in they reach
Spittin my verbal attack with the impeccable speech
How bout niggas, gotta keep your dog on a short leesh
Got 'head speak, If not they try to play us like suckas
The most commitment, wanted non commitment givin mothafuckas
Not sayin that all men fall in this category
But one look in his eyes and I can tell they whole story
Lookin for a friend or wife for late nate creep if he's horny
If he's sincere, got G, or pick up lines that corny
Tryin to say that he adore me, when he don't even know me
That type of weak game will leave a nigga, poor broke & lonely
Willin to go and stick anything that let's em stick 'em
'Cause through all that bullshit, he's lookin for anotha victim

Brrr, stick 'em, hahaha stick 'em
Brrr, brrr, stick 'em, hahaha, stick 'em
Brrr, stick 'em, hahaha stick 'em

Perfect example, it was like Monday the 10th
Late afternoon, just on my king and it was time well spent
In any event, this niggas eyein me, it's evident
Try hard to cement, to ignore his twisted compliments
He seem hell bent for my time, a hundred percent
Asked to come to sit at my table, if I was the age of contended
And no why he would put himself through such torment
And despite the corny line, you could see the extent
That he would go, said he'd pay my rent, dress me and give me dough
Follow by cants and comments bout my bodies measurements
I said ""I don't drink moet, take loot to get bent
Or use niggas to pay rent, I'm independent""
His response that ""You heaven sent
But I haven't met a chick that ain't have a price yet""
I said ""Well, I must be a different type of female
While bitches waitin to exhale, I plot schemes to black male
Talkin bout, you wash your car, who you knew and your wealth""
A new expirement, thinkin this niggas playin himself
With just his arogance, not to exclude his rude attitude
How he pursued, relentless references to seein me nude
The wrong move, this jiggy nigga really thinks he's smooth
Like he got somethin to prove, and I got nothin to lose
I know his style, never ran into a femme fatale
Like you hearin right now, comin through ya ear canal
I smile politely, so as not to blow my cover
Carryin on conversation, knowin that I'm on some other shit
Should have stopped when he had the chance to quit
Talkin about his income, and how bout he want to get some
Next time we meet, he'll just be the next victim

[Chorus]

Like my girl Nina, bangin body and she was cute
But she'd only fuck with niggas if they had mad loot
Plenty ice, nice ride, but she'd always have to drive
Trying to compesate the shit, that as a youth she was deprived
She survived, only to end up to being 85
Talkin bout I played that nigga, keep it real baby...",Anotha Victim

This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Avoid jail legend, fingerprints on full metal
Jackets like design, so that you can't hack it
But you mustn't get caught up in these devilish tactics
Never let the man pull ya string like Geppetto
The game's the same, Boricua or Moreno
Don't watch ya step and you be like, mi amigo
Forensics made the maps, so now he's on death row
Yo what's the steelo, real brothers do it on the d-low
Knowing's have the battle, so now you know
To be on point, 'cause anybody can be a casualty
Some brothers lost there life, fuckin' with O-P-P
Um robbery and P-C-P
From the cradle to the state penitentiary
He'll be in the middle of next century
Ask me, is it crying sakne
You got to watch how you flow and you will grow
If not you get tripped up in the ghetto

This is for the youth black love
This is for the ghetto, black love, black love

This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Sellin' yae yo, playin' see-lo, duckin' po-po
Some brothers got murdered over a kilo
Five zero ask questions, but nobody know
What's the M-O, another brother trying to get dough
Be careful how you live, 'cause that's how you go
Wild like Rambo, get shot down by the Commando
Call your co-defendant sing like D'Angelo
No problemo, but upstate you sing soprano
Police sadimize, a man at the seven oh
Be careful where you go yo, and just in case you ain't know
I flow, to liberate the ghetto

[Chorus: x4]

This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Trying to be like Pablo, DeNiro, Al Pacino
You be all right until you run up on Colombo
Get caught red handed, so you got to go
You lose the crib, the car, the women and the dough
This can't be happenin' so you like ""Oh No""
So avoid this fate, and absorb the conscious flow
This is not a demo, strictly for the ghetto
Not the limo, work for the pimp, hustler and the ho
And I'm gonna let you know
Whether you as black as jack or brown as Nino
Black Love, is what we need to flow
From the ghetto

Jeru the Damaja,"What niggas deal, they last 24 I did in the first
Before the doctor cleaned off the afterbirth
I kicked a verse, smoked a blunt, shooked the Earth
Smacked the physician, and fucked the nurse
The truth hurts, like a sword in the hand of this expert
Cuttin through your soul, like your best friend did your dirt
Mental like physical blows destroy ego's
Your style is Babylonian, like dicks in assholes
The drama unfolds, don't mean nothing up my nose
I can't stand snow, it only blows like nitro
Blistering, my flows I'm splittin, so I hope you listening 
Super shoutout to all my niggas in prison
Shout to the pyramids, the cypher and scription
Science fact not fiction, I cut with precision
Speak multiplication, subration, addition
Division, Great Solar Stance burns compition

""This-this-this-this is the Showdown""

I put you in the chicken wing like Bob Backlund, 
jack ya team captain
Bring drama like summer night, ghetto action
Some honies got it twisted, fat asses I mash 'em
Cops like jewels, back in the days I snatch 'em
You catch a tantrem, date how the raws rockin the drum
Float like the white lotus, kill like Whitey in Vietnam
You should peel arm, gorilla tactics like Viacom
Set shit on fire like a bomb, up in smoke like Cheech & Chong
True blacks too strong can't let nothin stand in my way
Shit will get thick like Juice 60 in Friday
In Brooklyn, kill MC's like Captain Hook your children
To rappers I'm a villain, fill esteem wan't my secret like Samson
Picture so hard, I stunt your grandson son
Teleport from Coast To Coast like Spaceghost
Like soy butter on my breakfast toast
And when It comes to makin it nasty, I flips it the most

""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""
""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""

Setting it off like pistols in the projects
The climax hold ya six like nasty hot wet sex
But string tech I catch wreck, ejucalate when I inject
Not a player hatter, regulator, trick niggas get checked
When I resurrect hip hop, you know the bullshit stop
Like you got the oo-wop, the pops and what nots
Fruity like Ed Koch, ya straight boo-tops, I'm top notch
Super funky like a derelict prostitute prop
Ya hear gun shots, the coroner shows up to take flicks
Shit is feet, but no feet shit like chicks with dicks
Ya throat flip too quick, to blaze magnetic
Paramedics roll up on the scene, 
it's tragic, don't deal with Magic

Packing a force like 18 Bronzemen

The first verse, perfect design conquest your desert thirst
Highly blessed, can't recept the evil luers curse
From the mansion to the slums, where the evil luers lurk
My life's work, want it so bad it hurts
I see three of a side, like nipples through at church
Mic experts, manipulate out through the universe
Bitches wit dicks, reveal how niggas livin in skirts
Perverts, I put to death and throw to hell head first
My word is plated gold, isin't equal the work
Mental birth can show signs of movin Heaven and Earth
Never deal or take car, wear your heart in your dirt
Rhymes baptised in fire and never been burnt

As I flex, on the set we ghetto intellect
My minds def, twice that of an all time vet
Quietest cat, rock around with no concept
Hit the L start choking and sleep with one eye open
You can try me, until I can get under your skin like poison ivy
Words invincible, hit it strictly for the pledgin principal
Continual, pen is like my sword I feel the armor
Hypnotic melodies, never gympsy steak charmer
Hearts is eye, blaze a stronger than a marijuana
You think I'm done, no, got dot.comma

With maddic overdose like that guy from Nirvana
Time was cut short, like a fair weather friend

In camouflage, gone just like a desert mirage
Try to escape the fate, safe in proper sabotage

My verbal swordplay, bounces off the walls like richochets

Jeru the Damaja,"This goes out to all my young brothers and sisters
Hold ya head, things ain't always what they seem
I'm about to give you a dose of reality
Real deal

Nowadays, records are played and superstars are made
Still mothers in the ghetto, rent don't get payed
As a result, bullets are sprayed and their sons are laid
It's no myth, in ghetto life, if you don't fight you fade
Surviving in the streets, not a task for ordinary men
Growing up in the hood, young black and supahuman
Caught up in the game of blocks and cops run your block
Intercourse with witches and hunted by warlocks
For props, boos-hoot pop, another brother drops
He barely knew his pops, 
now his little seed will barely know his pops
Tunnel vision like a cyclops
I give you x-ray vision with these supahuman eye drops
My niggas in the ghetto, give it everything you got
'cause until we reach the top, can't stop and won't stop

[Chorus: x2]
Can you feel?
The presha, the the the presha
Hand over
The presha, the the the presha

Journalists write articles 'cause they can't write rhymes
Ever since I was a youth I dealt in crime
Now I'm trying to reach the youth, to preserve what's left
There's a fork in the road, choose life or death
There's too much stress, too many bullets for your vest
Temptress, suck ya best, exotic strains of syphillis
The rest, rest in the Earth, only the best progress
It's you who think I see commercial success
Warning, this shit is real, this is not a test
And what I express worth more than a Lexus
Serve it like baby food, still hard to digest
Long ass niggas is mental slaves, I gotta protest

[Chorus: x2]

Baby in the crib, and dad got no loot for food
So he do what he got to do
Keep it real, I don't playa hate ya
God my divine nature, 
sent at this time to stabilize the structure
We should all live like wise kings, 
now sing praise to the gutter
The blazed double X, concealed like a box cutter
Brothers should be teaching, not murdering one another
Word, to the mother land, kill the other man
Lord of the concrete jungle, and Tarzan was a black man
Swingin on vines vibin, been balancin the eco system
And since there's no more niggas in the ghetto, here I am

Thought I disappeared now that the smoke has cleared
I come from times with inabitions, face to face with fears
While shootin stars wishing that I can shift my gears
So I raise my glass eye, I drink to that, say cheers
And let the fire water wash away the tears, burn like salt
On open wounds, thoughts consume all consetions
Give birth to these rhymes like an oral see-section
Uhh, positive connection throughout the galaxy
Time to switch to reality, make proper arrangements
for the souls of fatalities
It's the same for niggas that stuck with that slave mentality
Or these wack ass rappers, they got no originality
But my mentality, helps me travel around the galaxy
Time gets shorter, I'm on the water, run insanity
It seems like everyone was after me
Three's a nasty girl like Vanity
Make niggas wild, I smoke la, anything to keep my sanity
Ain't got no friends, everyone with me is family
If they standing next to me, nothing's what it seems to be
Sending energy, when I rhyme, but no time for idol questions
If freestyling is my bible, when I fall in hip hop sessions
Of the tribal blessings, lessons to be learned
Respect had to be earned and not given
On the fourth of them but not amongst the men that living
Guy collides, when selfish minds can't asked to be forgiven
Ain't no turning back the hands of time, 
when past spirits have risen

Jeru the Damaja,"[Verse 1 - Jeru The Damaja]
Shinin' star but not a movie actress
Mind refined, skintone many shades of blackness
And every man want to have this, because she's the baddest
And her booty it got the fatness
Many come with excess bagage from broken homes
To heal her dome I wrote these poems
And most love to talk on the phone
The real ones they either love you or they leave you alone
Act childish even though they fullgrown
Some jump badge you gotta be like: shorty watch ya tone
Causin' commotion cause the species deal with emotion
No matter how dope they are they put you through the motion
Some move real fast and others in slow motion
The ones that's upset they have they granny fix some love potion
Some love flowers most smell like baby lotion
Some so ill they have a player talkin' love and devotion
The ones that been done wrong watch how you approach 'em
And save those phoney lines they can tell if you genuine
No matter how un-coachable I can coach you
I need to form my team...my black queen

God's most exquisit design wish they all were mine
The way she walk get me caught up everytime
Damn honey mad fine on some Sade shit is it a crime
The way she shake doubletape makes you break ya neck
Women little or nothing talkin' about she want respect
You gettin' weak she eat you up and gingerly step
But if it's tight then you just might get her in check
But come correct and don't have the wrong one have ya baby
Ask her how many niggaz she want she'll probably say three
Some love to love you some love to spend money
I'm crazy tight with my loot but she can get all my honey
My man doin' life behind ears and that ain't funny
And the sky is the limit if they find themselves a dummy
Most like exquisit gear but they crib look mad bummy
Believe in T.V. with no concept of reality..my black queen

[Verse 3 - Jeru The Damaja]
Ancient universal symbol of fertility, black soil
Wicked royal and loyal her skin mask moves from baby oil
She makes my temper boil I'm bound of her duty
Whether she got a real fat, or real flat booty
Due love the now man woman and child she makes me smile
All those show her conference try to copy her style
Mothers watch my sisters and nieces
As I grow older my respect for her increases
If she a hoe I scoop up and teach her like Jesus
My excistance without her is meaningless
My goal is more than to get her undressed
I mentally caress this goddess, pittoresque the nubian princess
See I once called her a bitch but she is a empress
And I can't live without her this I must confess
And thought sometimes she fills my life with stress
Nevertheless I love her to death...my black queen

War, my skills is this spelled backwards
I perform for the white kids but do this for the black kids
To get this ill takes practice I'm takin' over
the industry with ghetto verbal and tactics
Hard times build muscle like lactic acid
Some entertainers losin' they minds
makin' porns pissin' on kids
The streets is ill save the theatrics
I still treat a bitch like a bitch
while y'all niggaz is doin' backflips
I can't trip I guess it's part of the game
like Ja-Rule bitin' my name
like MJ glowin' up in flames
like chickens suckin' dick for fame
As things change I remain the same
tryin' to keep sane
While many strugglin' to maintain
The stress of ghetto livin' can bust ya brain
It seems the road is paved with less joy than pain
I want to regress but I refrain
If I don't I rage war
Right here in the streets of New York
Some talk the talk, but don't walk the walk
Like Muslems at the corner store sellin' pork
My little brother still outlined in chalk
They went from forties to the champagne court
Videos and true lies makin' all the birds squalk
Little girls butt naked so the president's stalk
My man say he was god holdin' the devil's pitchfork
That's why I'm throwin' rhymes like Geronimo's tomahawk

[Verse 2: Jeru]
War, many shout it but don't want to see it
I stay low and lay boobytraps like the cong in Viet..nam
Loud talkin' and stares can't do me harm
Know some niggaz want to stop it I'm still droppin' the bomb
Shit is death like Tennessaucee ring the alarm (ring the alarm)
It's still a mystery to you like the 82nd psalm
Some fight 'til the end some sell out like Uncle Tom
So much contempt others that's flow with they jelly like napalm
War, is more than hand to hand and firearms
It's only won when the mind is calm
So I study Sun-Tzu and stopped smokin' chron'
In my left hand riches, long life in my right palm

Here's your chance to be a gangsta nigga, back that thing out
The next move you make will decide your fate
Will it be die on the train or live life behind the gate
You framing[?] minor[?] [??], you contemplate prison rate
Your heart skip a beat and you select upstate

It's one of those types of nights that everything's goin right
In a club, fishing for bitches, anything tryin to bite
Then the one that you want gets caught in your sight
Face - picture perfect, big titties and fat ass
She's asked if she want to drink and she kindly pass
Her response let you know she's not the average stunt
She asks ""do you got a dutch"", you say ""yeah"", she roll a blunt
Weed[?] and conversation good, you fill the evening with laughter
Then Shorty like: ""yo, whatchu doing after""
She continues what she's doing is outta character
But, she live's alone and she wants you to smash her
You bug, you can't believe that she tryin to fuck
You like: ""let's bounce"", then you think ""Lady Luck""
You exit the club, hop up in your truck

Get paper commit murder and pimp on hoes
Crazy ice around your neck with the thugged out flows
But it sounds like game to the street wise pro's
Cause you be blabbing the [??] that you don't even know
Straight pillow talking, I hope you walk the walk
And be doing all the shit that's blasting out of shortie's walkman
The last verse is laid, your men is like [??] dope fiend
All of a sudden the sound [???] wide open
3 niggaz come in, screaming ""where the cash""
And you know the shit is real cause they ain't rocking masks
They rocking big ass canons dawg, you better think fast
Do you run what's yours or go for yours and blaaast..

Jerusalem,"I was twenty-five in Berlin '38.
I had just bought a little store, 
And the war was close
Then I met her, 
Rebekah with her wonderful smile.
And I was in love, 
And she was in love, the future was ours
We married soon, and Joseph and Sarah came.
We loved them so, our dream came true.

Clouds gathered dark, 
I couldn't understand it.
I simply didn't see it, 
I should have, but I didn't.

Under the star, my heart beats there 
It was just because of the star.
Next year in Jerusalem, 
Next year in Jerusalem.

And late one night, 
I woke up from the noise in the street.
People were shouting, 
People were running in the stairs.
They knocked on the door, 
And then they came rushing in
With guns and no compassion, they said
'You have to come, 
One suitcase that's all, you must go now

We ran down the stairs.
Joseph wasn't fast enough, 
They kicked him and he fell, 
And he was only three.
I picked him up, and took him in my arms.
They took us to the train, 
They packed us like cattle.
Rebekah squeezed my hand, she said
'We must stay together no matter what happens'

How can I describe?
Cause when we arrived, they took Rebekah 
And the children aside, and we all cried.
She looked at me, I'll never forget her eyes, 
She said, 'I'll take care of the children'
And then they were gone, gone

Next year in Jerusalem.

More and more, faster

I felt the heat it reached my soul
'cause I was cold, my heart was melting

Jes,"Help me
The rejection
Take it away
I found my religion
Waiting in your pickup
All the time
Crazy wired

Everybody wants you
But everybody's had you
Makes no difference
Who you've got
Around you
Everybody needs to
Have a little bit of you
Before they fade away
Around you

Were you to messed up to notice
I've been away
Made my decision
Hiding in a doorway
Praying for
Some mid-night pride

Everybody wants you
Everybody's had you
Makes no difference
Who you've got
Around you
Everybody needs to
Have a little piece of you
Before they fade away
Around you

So gather down town
I might be singing today
A round about song
Of love to be
And how we
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Everybody wants you
Everybody's had you
Makes no difference
Who you've got

Jes,"I was a ghost before you came
I was a slave but then I changed
And I will take the good and bad from many
I am a slave to this again

So leave me alone before the strain of listening to me
Becomes more than you can bear
And maybe this time we will be fine
Or else tomorrow will be lost

I feel you calling me when I am alone
I feel you calling me, it's keeping me up
I wanna be with you now

There was a force I swear
I thought it'd take me high
There was a chance
That we could go so far

As I look in your eyes
I know that you say
No war, no war no more
No more battles to fight in this life

I feel you calling me when I'm alone
I feel you calling me, it's keeping me up
I wanna be with you now

I feel you calling me when I'm alone
Hot nights and moonlight, it's keeping me up
I gotta be with you now

Tell me you'll wait till then to find
What races and grates before we explode
And maybe this time we will be fine
And our tomorrow it won't be lost within this lie
I swear

I feel you calling me when I'm alone
I feel you calling me, it's keeping me up
I wanna be with you now

I feel you calling me when I'm alone
Hot nights and moonlight, it's keeping me up
I gotta be with you now

Jes,"I can get to heaven
Walking out in the streets at night
Pushing my soul into the open wind
And in a daze I've been there
In a daze I begin to see the way

I can get to heaven
Lying put in the beach at night
Giving it up under the ocean wind
And in a daze I've been there
In a daze I begin to see the way, to see the way

I can get to heaven
Walking out in the streets at night
Pushing my soul into the open wind
And in a daze I've been there
In a daze I've been there
In a daze I begin to see the way

Hey, I've been to heaven

",Heaven
Jes,"I sit alone
Wishing that you were here
I pick up the phone and no one's even there
But I hear your voice
And it sounds so clear
And I'm telling you just how I feel
Wishing that you'd come and make it so real
(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Have you really right here tonight?
(Are you gonna make everything right?)
Why you standing here inmy door
Are you the one that I wished for, yeah

I wished upon a tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

Now you will mean more than the word to me
If we could be more than a fantasy
I do believe one day that you will be reality
Just you and me
Being everything I knew me could be
(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Have you walked into my life?
Are you really right here tonight?
(Are you gonna make everything right?)
Standing right here in my door
Are you the one that I wished for?

I wished upon a tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

I wished upon a tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

When you're in my thoughts
(I know in my heart)
You were made for me
That's why we have to start
(Making our love so true and...)
Making a love for two
(So make my dreams come true tonight)

I wished upon a tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Did you really walk in my life?
Are you really right here tonight?

I wished upon a tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination",Imagination
Jes,"This is here, this is now
This is all we can fathom
All that makes you feel it right
So grab a hold, get on top
'Cause this is all you can have it
If you just listen to the soul you become

I'm crying out
To every corner of the earth
Why can't we live as one
In Ohm, in Ohm

This is it, this is now
This is all we can do it
All to make us feel some peace
So grab a hold, get on top
'Cause this is all we can handle
What ever keeps you alive

'Cause I'm crying out
To every corner or the earth
Why can't we live as one?
In Ohm, in Ohm, alive

Whatever keeps you alive

In Ohm, to every corner of the earth in Ohm
Why can't we live as one
In Ohm, in Ohm 'cause I'm crying out

Touching and so beautiful
This promise we’re making
It’s our ritual

I love where you found me
Some battles must be fought
This chance we’re taking
That we will endure

Find me away in
I know where your souls been
And it’s pulling me closer

Looking out from the outside in
I know where your souls been
And it’s pulling me closer

So fast I can’t see straight
Until we’ve collided
And I’m blown away

Into a sonic illusion
Where we will reunite
On edge on of the morning
Turning dark into light

Find me away in
I know where your souls been
