Project 86,"It's the first day
Since I handed you your final rose
In your house
I'm staring out the window at our tree (We planted below)

The heights of which
You'll never
Ever know

You always
Were there to rescue me
From December

In my minds eye
I see you next to me as I'm on my knees
It's in this place
That you showed me how to ask eternity

For shelter
For comfort
For relief

I see our branches stretching
To heights you'd not believe
One day these leaves will reach you
And there will be no more

Pain

You always gave me refuge
Unconditional
You always offered shelter
From December's snow
My chin still rests upon you
While my feet they sway
I wonder if you'll look the same
When you embrace me
On that day",From December
Project 86,"Dictate
What you think is pivotal
Mandate
Just for the sake of
Ego
Controlling your decision making
The world we're missing is still ours for the taking

Accelerate
Into isolation
Gravitate
To comfort, presentation
Anxiety laden, restless confusion
No courage, no confidence, absent delusion

Most of us would be lying
Holding fast to denying
If we
Said we're all feeling swell and content
All of us would be slipping
Backpedaling, gripping
So tight
To our fragile confidence

We're trying
Just to convince
The world we're
Something
That we can't be
We are not
Afraid of
Being alone
Of being caught
By oursselves
With only
Our own thoughts

Activate
With hope and integrity
Honesty
The only true currency

The guilt, not the guilty

You stopped me bitter faced to ask me this
You, I don't understand your agitation
Why can't you write a track that's sensitive?

It isn't because

I wish I see-see-could little man
I wish I see-see-could little man

You took a step back when I started howling
You turned and told your friends with hostile frowns
This dude is furious I don't quite get it
I wonder why he doesn't just calm down

I wish I see-see-could little girl

I made my way back to the Merc Booth after
A man confronts me smiling ear to ear
The sweat is dripping from his face in gallons
And all he wants to do is shake my hand

He stops to tell me he'd be six feet under
That's if it wasn't for our caveman jam

Project 86,"Everyone down on the floor
No sudden moves and lock the door
I've got this feeling I'm chasing
I'll never rest until I find it

I've been plotting away in my heart every day
To put this plan into action
And though I try to resist, I find the thing is this
Until I get it, there's no satisfaction

I want something you have
I want it oh so bad
Don't move, hand it over
I won't stop till it's in my hands

Deep in the recess of every man
Is a thief, a robber, a criminal
Below the surface of every hero
Is an envy, a restless evil

And though I try to resist, I find the thing is this
Until I get it, there's no satisfaction

I want something you have
I want it oh so bad
Don't move, hand it over
I won't stop till it's in my

You must meet my demands

I remember the magic
So I can take one last trip
Down the lane of your memory

Project 86,"We drove through misty canyons
Our destination seemed resolved
But through high beams, tragedy called

It seemed a normal evening
We rode in silent walls between
Our wills like guillotines

I sped on mountain roads as
Your words came piercing through my chest
I'm your usual suspect

I turned my head in defense
That's when I heard you crash

And siren screams like rival factions
Two stories are told
We never knew at any moment
We just might implode

They're watching you crashing into
Crashing into me
And wishing they had what we see
Had what we see, had what we believe

We were magnetic fields
When we came together long ago
You glowed like burning halos

We spent a lifetime on the
Beaches of Normandy in vain
What for I can't explain

I looked to you from the darkened highway
Facing you in tears
And in that moment, metal twisted
And you disappeared

They're watching you crashing into
Crashing into me
And wishing they had what we see
Had what we see, had what we feel

They're watching you crashing into
Crashing into me
And wishing they had what we see
Had what we see, had what we believe

A fatal evening's drive is what
They always will assume
But I know better as I collide
Face first with you

They're watching you crashing into
Crashing into me
And wishing they had what we see
Had what we see, had what we feel

They're watching you crashing into
Crashing into me
And wishing they had what we see
Had what we see, had what we believe

Project Kate,"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
So help me GOD
I just felt like telling the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone
Come on

All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(Was a father)
Was a father
(That's all)
That's all!
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed, was a father
(Was a father)

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?
(I'm feeling you)

[Chorus]

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screaming I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

[Chorus]

My head was spinning, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

But lets talk about the niggas who supposed to be real street niggas
Like we talking about real street niggas but they ain't
There's a lot of niggas out here mane
That's got real nigga title real street nigga title
That nigga know they the god damn police
Real shit, real shit
Cuz I'ma tell you like a nigga told me the other day
Mothafucka said they got caught with like
Was it, was it half, a half of thang of boy
Okay did you get locked up and you stay locked up for 2 months
And then you back out
Hold on wait a minute, wait a minute
Now you know I've said it myself
Maybe the nigga got a bond you know what I'm saying
But hold on that nigga got a ankle bracelet?
That's the time he doing time on a ankle bracelet
Or, or check the game, check the game
Not a ankle bracelet but the nigga actually your actually free
Like how the fuck you free and you got caught with some boy
Like everybody know you caught with some boy mane, good bye
How the fuck you free when you got caught with some boy
And nigga out here acting like its all cool, like I'm slow
You know what I'm saying
Nigga tryna check me
[?]
I don't communicate with rats
I don't toss with rats
You know what I'm saying

And we will fuck around and shank some of you niggas like real talk
You niggas will come out missing out here

Fuck nah I ain't fucking with you holly ass nigga",Outro

",Chickenhead
Project Pat,"Welcome to the hypnotize zone
Today you'll hear the story of Russell Resthaven
And the day he tried to save his girlfriend
Here's the story

Man, you won't believe what done
Happened to me now, man
What?

I let this nigga come out my house and he fucked my bitch
But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though
Man, fuck dat hoe man, you can't be tryin' to save that bitch
My nigga and them housed the hoe on Brown and Frayser

Man, I spent cheese on her and everything
And I bought rangs and some mo' shit
I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin' marry
You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man

I love her man, I love her man
Quit lying man, I love her man
I gotta marry her man
I'mma marry her

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

I'mma introduce me, Project Pat, I keep it real
I'mma introduce you, you's a sucka faking deals
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife

I don't even get why you be eating out her draws
You done bought the bitch a phone
Now you screening in all the calls
It's about 4 a.m., she ain't nowhere to be found

Somewhere wit her friend, dick in face and turned to ground
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go
Suckin' dick, chewin' cat, and I hear she on that blow
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew

Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew
I know just what to do, you can ask the hoe to leave
Once the bitch pack her shit, hurry up and run them streets
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before
It's a U.F.O. or a hoe that wouldn't go

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Jackie's simple, Jackie's quicker
Jackie likes to suck a dick-a
All she wanna do smoke a blunt get a drink of liquor
Lip-ah to the balls booty even enough to smell dodie

You be tryna, save a sweater but you need the fuckin' letter
Be the bitch she really is-a, suck my dick, you goin' kiss her
Hating hoes, try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her
Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell

Call her up there, nig man there's a way-a
She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda
Camcorder caught on tape, did I stutter man
I should of fucked her in her mouth fast, she be taking all cash

Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas
Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her
Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa
Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava
You'll never get the bitch 'cause she wit that West Haven

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Got one in the chamber fo you weak ass cowards
And I'm tired of you niggas goin' saving dese bitches
Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get 'em

I ain't trying to be a trick, I'm just sayin my dog
Let a nigga get deep down in them draws
Take her over to my dogs so we can do 'em ya'll
Everybody can do it, let's just have a ball

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Too many niggas out here cowards
They be saving dem hoes they be paying them hoes
But a nigga like me can not go

I'm be kickin' in doos I be fuckin' dese hoes
I be slamin' 'em down like Dominoes
Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro
In and out dese hoes does like, ""Whoa""

Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her

Since you niggaz hate, then your plan didn't wizork

On that ATL tattle tale to my bizurbs
Say you saw me with anotha gal, now don't be scared
Man, you might as well throw in your towel, youse a fake thug
Face to face I shoot you in your mouth

'cause ain't no love say, you from the North Memphis ten
But I doubt that
Stick ya'lls noze in others folks affairs we ain't 'bout that
Weak motherfucker wanna stare when you see me

Couldn't wait to snitch punk, bitch you wanna be me
Gotta pay some dues but my shoes to big for ya
Don't be out here, trying to claim my hood, I don't know ya
Turn state niggas ask if you was a roller

Those who oppose me shall get no leway
Lying on real niggas end up in gun play

Punk mutherfucker, you gonna hear this and feel me
Smile in my face, really wanna kill me
That's if you had heart to pull the trigga
Catcha murda charge, I don't think so, my nigga

Weak ass hoes play games like they killas
Always runnin' mouth braggin' on they niggas
Cyper Gardens did and I did not have no dough
No fresh clothes 'cause a playa was real poor

I was locked up 2-0-1 wearing bo bo's
Playin' dominoes shooting dice big ol' Afro's
Now I'm on the town and I'm layin' the smack down
Nigga, I ain't you best to check my background

Fuckin' 'round with real McCoys, coward boys that bring the noise
Rollin' round in SUV's, DVD's, man fuck some 20's, I'm lo key

Lookin' for y'all cowards 'cause y'all talking out the side of your mouth
Knowin' that the Triple 6 is one of the hardest rappers out
DJ Paul and Juicy J, best producers in the town
I've been got the crown those that ain't down get run down

Man, if one of you bitches wanna step up to the juice
Talking 'bout that nigga wrong talkin' 'bout what cha gonna do
Man, it's on, if you rappers wanna bring it to the door
To you crosses in my click, I'm treat you like a hoe

I'm a tell you like this if you talkin' in my face

Every time you see me coming, you be speakin' like we cool
Ain't your motherfucking nigga and ain't no motherfucking fool
",If You Ain't from My Hood
Project Pat,"I was broke, pocket full of lint now I'm on the bricks
Getting paid like no other dog now I'm stackin' chips
On the road like a trucker man had to take some trips
Doing shows for my brothers but strapped with extra clicks

Just in case any sucker would wanna run his lips
A female I don't trust her 'cause women like to trip
I stay all by my getty green hell with some time
There some crime that was petty seem still getting mine

All this hate trip I'm hearing, though you I ain't fearing
Better try to be growing old man with your children
Escalate what a nigga staring his last days nearing
Trying to get it right with God only one who I'm fearing

Hopin' I'ma make it, keep it real
Never knew I get the chances for a nigga to get paid
So I take it living like a player should
Wishin' that you could knowin' it's all to the good
Still down with the hood

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Last year my cousin took a fall, a sad song
Seem like we were just on the phone now he gone
People use to try to judge him sayin' he was wrong
But you can't try to judge a man you do you wrong

Smokin' out on a daily base I'm in the clouds
Drinkin' liqour fallin' on my face
Wondering how I survive all this foolishness
Up in the street ridin' dirty I ain't new to this
I'm packin' heat but the streets very hazardous
To a niggaz health watch your step you ain't Lazarus

You'll meet your death
I'm the man from the North, North site of the town
With the will to support me and keep 'em found
Stayin' down got your gold grills dro in the air
Barbecue on the grill sun cool for a player
When I ride through the streets hoes are plentiful
'Cause the life that we live so beautiful

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Gotta take the good with the bad
Smile with the sad, love what you got
And remember what you had messin' with the ones
Who help me in the times
When I was flat broke didn't even have a dime

My family they was there, my niggaz they was there
The rest of ya'll left me for dead didn't care
I use to have dreams livin' large in this thang
And by the grace of God I'm still alive in this thang

I strive in this game to get all that I can
Never said I'm the man, respect me as a man
To you ones think I owe you somethin'
Now that's a joke, think you bad come

And get you somethin', how low to dope
Either treal either fake, you can love you can hate
Either go and get your own or you can't sit and wait
On the next man to come up you can peep this
You can do what I do handle your business

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful

Oh, so beautiful

His shop about to close he shoulda had on a vest
Don't fuck with me nigga that's something I have to stress
Keep talking shit boy your gonna end up with one less

All you niggas do is gossip like some lil' hoes
You might as well go down to the Shake Junt and slide down poles
Now you running while I'm gunning
Stomping hoping to get close to some shelter
Better catch up with some polices, hope that they can help ya
Help to ? you just better get some younger quick and fast

I think it's funny 'cause ya'll faggots be still calling my studio
Trying to get back, stay who you with 'cause I don't need ya hoe

I call up my niggaz we buckin' and tossin' with no mercy hoe
We packin' mass case and decoratin' ya with bullet holes
La Chat I be ready you bustaz ain't got no reeds and shit
That leaves me no choice to grab my glock and go fucka wit

You speak killa talk but ain't no killa in yo blood boi
The infrared be beamin', I got this scope-a behind your door
You niggaz can't take it you hate the fact that we runnin' it
You ain't gotta love it but you gon learn to respect it bitch

Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south
Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up
It's a hold up, everybody fold up
Niggaz talk like they tough but they ain't got no nutts, bitch

I'm shootin' a dike in her breasto, coward in his chesto
And this police nigga, what we call em' Donnie Brasco
If you bitches want war, you can bring it, let's go
When I put this tone in yo face presto
(Click)

A killa in a black coat, goin' to make a mesto
Leave you in da street wit a bloody Willie Esco
Drankin' on some scotch and we choppin' down that coco
Tryin' to roll some pot in a fuckin' optimol-doe

Don't you make the wrong move and you'll get your ass killed dawg
A fake ass nigga but he claimin' that he real dawg
You ain't gotta lie to kick it actin' like you down dawg
Always lookin' lite trying to wear a murder frown dawg

Don't you get smacked and be gettin' off the pavement dawg
Don't you make me act a fool when somebody hatin' me dawg
Hypnotize Camp Posse got my fuckin' back dawg
Frayser Boy will leave you stankin', pop you with that gat dawg

I'm watchin' out for you polices, niggaz who'll tell it
This union will rip your head in pieces, I know ya feel it
These lyrics just like Mona Lisas 'cause you can sell it
The posse click tight like feces, I know ya smell it

This ghetto hood shit is crucial just like a murder
You step, whoa, then we shoot ya we quick to serve ya
You hate us feelings mutual so don't be scared-a
The HCP will do ya mayne, we gon hurtcha

Where dem hood, hood signs (throw some 'bows, throw some 'bows)

It's the return of the gangsta - like my niggas OutKast
Smokin' on the dank-a - shut ya mouth, I might pass
Niggas off the heezy, fuck all at the fuckin' bar
On the floor or in the parking lot they throw it out the car
If they throw the wrong sign - niggas better handle it
Fuck goin' outside - right here you gettin' wet
I'm glad for this here, all I know is this here
And you thinkin' I'ma let you disrespect this shit here
Before I blow a nigga ass off - him and his hoe
Ready to rob me a bitch and get the fuck out the do'
This shit is real dumb nigga, who fucka say we playin'
Boy you in the wrong land, fuckin' wit a grown man
It's: ""MAFIA, MAFIA"" from the beginning into ending
While you grinnin' I whoop yo ass, bitch in one inning
You know the biz, Three 6 is the name boy
You heard my sign now won't you show me what you claim boy

We up all night, we smokin' that shit
Somebody run they mouth and then we bop on the bitch
They called us niggas, we run in packs
Some playa hate this skin because the color is black
We sag our jeans, the ride be clean
Them twanky-twin-twins make them rims be mean
We bracing ahead, we trust in the lead
The fool we don't like is police and the Fed.'s
And if you violate - get that tone to the head
And if ya girl approach us - we'll see her in bed
I'll probably own her flick 'cause she ain't nothin' to us
A neighborhood chewer-hut, hoodrat, slut
We people on the left - and we folks on the right
We throwin' up them thangs - and we startin' them fights
The swinging we be doin' is a ugly site
We sleep in the morning and we come out at night

[Chorus 4x]

[Project Pat]
Fuck around and get gun end, straight up out the pen
From the mane with the sawed-off, lay up off the Gin
You can win if you squeeze first - hollow points disperse
You may leave in an ambulance or inside a hearse
Niggas curse when they get caught, then they go to jail
Took a purse with the gold watch - but I can't make bail
Yeah its sad, but I did the crime, I except the time
Just another broke hood nigga - cheese up on my mind
Grab the nine, wanna make change
Suckers lay it down, Project Pat and them Three 6 niggas who get down
'Bout that loot, let the bullets shoot - get across your grill
I'm a North Memphis dinner thief - all about a meal
And I will still retaliate, all you ones that hate
I'm a rider for Hypnotize, move or wrapped in tape
A survivor so realize, catchin' you on late
In the bushes don't be surprise, you gon' meet your fate

[Verse 2]
I'm bout to whip on this maggot means nothing bitch

come up shorter and your face I'm'a re-arrange
you was looking strange but your pockets looking stranger
I was bumpin me some ruffin in the changer
swollen eyes busted lips but you know I'm loving you
in the club shakin hips everyday I'm cussing you
bitch I'm never trusting you that's because I'm smart hoe
other niggas give ya cheese they ain't got no heart though
hoe I'm gonna start yo ass with empty purse
break you like a cash register then put in hearse
conscience to the grave and I hope that you can see
that I must get paid if you wants to fuck with me

Chorus (2x)

[Verse 3]
Peter pipper beat the bitch
sweeped her in the conflict
through the town spit his game
introduced her to a trick
make-up hoe like a queen
cooking cakes candy rings
feeling up her pussy hole
rub her for the dingalings
but the hoe didn't meet her quarter
so I walked out in an order
break away from getting slapped start running for the border
known to whip you out your draws
bitch done went & told them laws
got domestic violent charge in the morning out them bars
duck niggas hate this shit
catch'em going quack quack
try snitching to a bitch trying to hold the mack back
but it ain't gone happen 'cause the playas out here rapping
to these hoes laying down the law while I get the cap'n
head cracking in a brick wall
got me in a midst brawl
showing out infront of folk
that'll make me kill ya'll
muthafuckin ass beat ya down like ya stole something
turn right around hey hoe let me hold something

You don't never want to try (this pimp this pimp this pimp)",This Pimp
Project Pat,"I only fuck wit those, who only fuck wit me

A sucka' play for games, a man play for keeps

I keeps me a nine millimeter just in case

A coward's in my face

These bullets he gon taste


A waste of your life, steppin' wrong, I'm on trees

Best ta leave me alone, best ta go make some cheese

Enemies come in all shapes, forms, sizes, colors

Could be your best friend, cousin, or brothers


I'll rob'em all, just to see who got the fatty stack

Walked in the bank, put the loot in the codauh sack

Slapped on the guard four times fo' he passed out

Eyes on that blow and my pockets was assed out

Had on a trench coat, wig and some goggles

If'n you resist, you may not see tomorrow

I'm in there, I den dared the police couldn't get me

But I made a slip up: had a trick wit me.


Chorus X2:


Don't turn around (Give me the fuckin' cheese trick)

Don't make a sound (Show me where them keys at)

Lay it on the ground (knowing that your pockets fat)

Fore' I buck you down (and I'm quicks' to do that)


Nigga starting braggin' in his hood bout the robbery

Wasn't long then, fore' somebody dropped the dime on me

I'm'a be the one they can't get to, they picked the boy up

Run his mouth just like a fool, he gon' get me fucked up

But, I'm'a have to get to him before the police do-a

Caught up with him night and day, not him and his crew-a

Sprang down Chelsie Ave. kinda in the evening

For this muhfuckas death, dawg I was fiend'n

He was looking at me strange, like I'm'a catcha

I done hopped out with the thang, lemme holla at'cha,

Foo, where you been dog? (My momma got sick, main!)

Fuck that got to do wit'chu? (Hold up I ain't your bitch, main!)

I heard you been talking your muh-fuckin' lips loose (Nah, it ain't like that dawg, I ain't no damn fool)

Looking in his eyes, I could see that he was so scared

I squeezed on the trigga with the gun to his fo'-head.


(Chorus x2)


Blew the top out his skull, now they want me dead

All the niggas in his hood, police and the feds

Stepped out of Westwood, way out of the side

On the other side of town, somewhere I can hide

I done threw my life away, hunted by them by pigs

Robbing every other day, drops in off my nig

They done found my whereabouts, bouts' to do me in

Kickin' in the front door, and I was in the den

SK was under the couch, snatch it off the wham

Open fire on them hoes, I didn't give a damn

Blood stream was full of dope, pump off coca leaf

Feds had me under a scope, and an infrared beam

Rifle bullet threw my throat, chokin', hit tha flo'

Gunpowder in my mouth, knockin' heavens door

Street life done took me out, and that shit ain't fake

I done fuck myself off, cause a bad mistake

Don't try to observe the truth, I don't break no ghetto laws
I don't put pressure mane on others to ease pain
Or brothers put in chains, help mothers to go insane

Project Pat'll never rat, even though I'm lovin' cheese
Picked it up, one more gat, some broke down to their knees
Told about murders and plots, talked about **** and glocks
Helped out on kidnappings, assisted on robbery spots

I done witnessed lunch money took down to homicides
Project ain't a baby to this game, I's a grown mane

Eu levantava e saía pra trabalhar
Escrevia um bilhete de bom dia pra te deixar
Vestia a primeira roupa que eu encontrasse por lá
Engolia um pão com manteiga e um suco de maracujá
Tomava meu banho sem ter você lá pra bagunçar
Deitava mais um minuto pra saudade amenizar
Te dava um beijo no rosto de leve pra não acordar
E dizia te amo sem você poder escutar

Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem
Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem
Pode sonhar, por que eu sei que sonhar faz bem
Vou te dar uma razão pra sonhar também
Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem

Pensava um pouco em você sozinho no ponto do busão
Entrava, rodava a catraca e sentava no fundão
Com fone no ouvido ouvindo algum rap boladão
Uma outra mina olhava e eu nem dava atenção
Chegava no meu trabalho com vontade de sair
Seu cheiro na minha roupa mas você não tava ali
Abria a gaveta que me fazia sorrir
Porque tinha uma foto que eu tirei vendo você dormir

Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem
Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem

Pode sonhar, por que eu sei que sonhar faz bem
Vou te dar uma razão pra sonhar também
Então eu te olhava pra ver se você dormia bem

Batia o cartão, saía, felicidade no olhar
Partia, comprava a flor mais bonita pra te agradar
Botava quinze de crédito e ligava o celular
'Cê já tinha vindo do trampo e tava fazendo o jantar
Entrava em casa correndo e te jogava no sofá
Fazia amor com você até minha perna bambear
Te abraçava, dava colo pra te carinhar
E dizia o quanto eu te amo até ver seu olho fechar

No início é difícil, mas vai se acostumar
O sofá é um péssimo vício, vai te acomodar
Eu prefiro um precipício pra me ensinar a voar

Pra trás
Mais de treze anos me esforçando demais
Enquanto uns 'tão falando
Disseram que era moda
E eu segui trabalhando
Os bico se incomoda
Porque a moda 'tá durando
Salve-se quem puder

Voltei com mais vontade, mostrei habilidade
Trazendo novidade, cheguei na sua cidade
Toquei seu coração, lutei pela cultura
Nessa vida dura e mantive os pés no chão

Ai que saudade dos tempos da Central
Ouvindo um freestyle do Kamau
No bolso ninguém tinha um real
Mas tinha rap, os amigos e era fenomenal

Eu tenho muita saudade de vocês
E penso, será que vai haver outra vez?
Um hip-hop com menos picuinha, com menos ladainha
E menos caras pensando que eles são reis

E mesmo se eu ga-ga gaguejasse pra fa-fa falar
Ou se eu errasse o po-po português pra ca-can cantar
Ainda assim fa-fa faria muito mais
Do que quem fala bonito mas só fala e não faz

Foco, um objetivo pra alcançar
Força, pra nunca desistir de lutar e
Fé, pra me manter de pé, enquanto eu puder
Haja o que houver, só preciso de

Renato Russo e Elis também
Cresci entre Sabotage e Kurt Cobain
De resto não sei, mas de influência eu 'to bem

Não tenho a melhor levada nem me acho flow man
Não sou o mais comentado, porém
Talvez eu seja o mais consciente
Que ninguém é mais que ninguém

Pois bem
A sorte foi lançada, a ultima jornada
Te vejo na chegada
Sei que cada pegada minha tem sangue e suor
Porque eu me preocupei em fazer bem
E não em ser melhor
Chega pra somar, ou então suma
Falar só por falar é mato, então resuma
Mas antes de falar de alguém assuma
Eu sei que o vocês fizeram no verão passado
Porra nenhuma

Tirei a vida pra dançar, fiz meu papel
Todos são comerciantes de baixo do céu
Pois vendem os seus sonhos pra pagar o aluguel

A esperança vai viver
Aqui um em um milhão nasceu pra vencer
Mas nada impede que esse um seja você
E tudo que você precisa ter é

Pra festa ou pra treta, é nóis sai da frente
Quando lembro da gente e me deixo sentir
Eu sinto tanta vontade de chorar que dá vontade de sorrir

Só me arrependi pelo tempo que eu não tava ali
E se a moda agora é ostentação deixa comigo
Invés de nome de carro eu falo nomes dos amigos

Hey irmão me diz como você 'tá a saudade ainda vai me matar
A saudade ainda vai me matar, é lembra quando tudo era fácil
A gente achava difícil mas era bom demais

Tempo que não volta mais (não volta mais)

Amigos são o um em um milhão
Agulha do palheiro que caiu na sua mão
Mais água no feijão, a mágoa sem razão
A divisão do pão, primeira e ultima comunhão
Amigos são alegria da gente
Saudade mais a frente lembrança mais presente
Um churrasco na laje, uma madrugada fria
A espera pelo ônibus o sol que trás o dia
Amigos são aquele carro que pega no tranco
Um pedaço do lanche, a companhia na fila do banco
Conselho salvador, risada por besteira
A manhã de Segunda e a noite de Sexta-feira
Amigos são a coragem que enfrenta nosso medo
Amigos são um cofre pra guardar todo segredo
E se contar nos dedos quantos amigos tem
Se encher uma mão você já 'tá muito bem, vem!

Se despediu de sua mulher com um beijo molhado
Pra provar do seu amor e pra marcar seu posto

Subiu no poste experiente, fez o seu esquema
Mas a noite reforçou o pedido pra Jesus

Mesmo caminho, mesmo horário, mas foi diferente
Ligou pra casa pra dizer que amava sua família
Acho que ali já pressentia o que vinha na frente

Gritei pro meu santo me mandar sinais
Também nessa terra fui longe demais
Pro santo sou burro por buscar a paz
Mas se eu buscasse a guerra seria bem mais

E no mundo louco, eu sou mais louco que o mundo
E o mundo me faz ir ficando mais louco ainda
E aos pouco eu fico tão louco e me sinto capaz
Ame demais, sofra demais
Consequentemente é assim, entendeu?
Mas, ó quem sofreu poderá dizer que já sentiu o amor
E aí já sofreu?

Tanto faz (tanto faz), tanto fez (tanto fez)
Não dá nada, dessa vez (dessa vez)
Vou lutar (vou lutar) por vocês (por vocês)
E quando tudo for melhor
Eu vou ligar pra ela
Eu vou ligar pra ela (eu vou ligar)
Eu vou ligar pra ela (eu vou ligar)
Eu vou ligar pra ela
Eu vou ligar pra ela",Tanto Faz

Um dia a mais pra sonhar
Um dia a mais pra correr

Então segura porque agora é força pura
Quem diz que vai me vencer vai ficar só na fissura por quê?

Eu tenho um dia a mais pra viver
Um dia a mais pra sonhar
Um dia a mais pra correr
Um dia a mais pra lutar

Barba cabelo e bigode
Pesado assim como pode?
Saiam da frente oh vagabundo não fode

Tudo morre em meio a essas multidões
Entre vidas, imensidões e perdidas almas
Idas e vindas de sonhos
Sonhos em plantações colheitas em prestações
E as chuvas que levaram à lavoura dos meus sonhos
Mendiguei pela vida
Chorei na avenida
Da amargura alma pura, pura dor recebida

Mantido em cálices de suor
Não quero ser melhor
Se eu for melhor do que já fui
Já não serei o pior
Porque hoje eu tenho um dia a mais pra sofrer
Um dia a mais pra chorar
Um dia a mais pra aprender
E um dia a mais pra tentar
O objetivo é claro raro e sincero
E é claro meu caro não paro
E se não paro acelero

O meu bonde é pesadão Shan Kingston
Ligeiro tipo bonde novos recordes quebrarão
O rap é fato negão, e é fato que a missão é o rap
No topo e se eu topo e boto no fogo a mão
Digo que é óbvio que agora é virar, mas só virar
Pra quem tiver memória e uma boa história pra contar
Se um dia é velório, teremos banquete amanhã
Mente sã, mas tudo pá isso que eu quero

Eu tenho um dia a mais pra viver
Um dia a mais pra sonhar
Um dia a mais pra correr
Um dia a mais pra lutar

Saiam da frente, vagabundo não fode

Quinas mandadas caindo do céu
Me lembra os otários caindo ao léu
'Tá bonito relógio, cabelo com gel
Agora mostra sua alma cruel

Define quem é quem pra mandar
Por mais que você imagine que alguém sempre há
Alguém pra que te discrimine na vitrine só quem pode pagar
E no biquíni só quem pode malhar
Mas vai mudar

Porque hoje eu tenho um dia a mais pra escrever
Um dia a mais pra cantar
Um dia a mais pra perder
E um dia a mais pra ganhar

Bolado mais bolado que nunca pesado
Quem gosta gosta, quem não gosta fala bosta coitado

Não tenho tudo que quis mas com certeza
Eu tenho tudo que fiz
E fiz feliz por ser quem sou por ter meu dom por só precisar de um giz
Diz que me diz, diz muita coisa mas não vê minha raiz
Eu vi a terra se abrindo
Eu vi o céu caindo

Um furacão se aproximando e tudo aqui sucumbindo
Tive medo
Mas o segredo é que eu venci o meu medo
Estalei os meus dedos e disse pode vir
Pois até padre Quevedo teria medo aqui

Eu tenho um dia a mais pra viver
Um dia a mais pra sonhar
Um dia a mais pra correr
Um dia a mais pra lutar

Ainda assim escrevo e sei que não te devo nada
Mas devo fazer alguma coisa pra isso mudar
Essa poderia ser uma musica de amor
Mas o ódio é inevitável pra quem tem medo de amar
E eu me entrego quando canto, tanto pranto já secou
No entanto me levanto e janto esses otários lá
Dá um teco, só um teco, eles diziam pra eu tentar
Escapei pelas beiradas nada pode me parar
Conheci um conhecido que diz que me conhecia
Que eu mudei só pelo fato de eu querer movimentar

Mas o louco é que eu sempre fiz jus, sempre carreguei
Minha cruz, poucos 'tavam lá pra me ajudar (ninguém)
Tipo quando cortavam minha luz todo mês depender do Sus
Pra ver por dois anos minha mãe piscar eu já tive de tudo
Tudo menos medo esse é o segredo deste cedo fui treinado pra lutar 
Quando Deus tirou meu chão que decepção
Levei anos pra ter a noção de que era pra me preparar
Agora pega suas coisas e saia daqui, eu não posso permitir

Dá saudade até doí só de lembrar, agora por um momento
Não segui seu rumo mesmo sem perder meu prumo você já
Pensando em se vingar, a gente é criança e tem muito
Pra aprender, muito pra crescer, nossa relação vai afundar
Eu preciso de você, mas não consigo entender como eu vou
Viver se eu fizer tudo que você mandar 
Eu não posso ser refém de ninguém, nem de mim nem de você 
Tenho um objetivo pra alcançar 
Quanto tempo a gente tem pra ser alguém
Vou de zero a cem a festa já começou e eu não 'to lá 

Minha mãe foi escritora, foi atriz, cantora, foi compositora
Mas o mundo não deixou continuar, e se esse era seu sonho
Quando componho eu sinto que através de mim hoje ela pode falar
Um dia eu vou te ver na porta do bar, vai bater saudade
Mas você não vai vir me cumprimentar, juro que ali vou sofrer
Vai doer, mas eu vou compreender que a nossa historia tinha hora pra acabar 
Então Deus que te abençoe seja feliz
Saiba que em tudo que fiz nunca quis te decepcionar 
Mas se a vida é assim enfim, pra nós isso é o fim 
Jogue a culpa em mim, pois nunca vou te culpar

Bateu no meu portão, com lágrimas no rosto

Me abraçou apertado, num gesto desesperado
Saudade mútua ela se entregou pra mim

Ela levanta antes de mim, capricha na maquiagem
Só pra me agradar
Menina a sina da minha vida é ver que a minha mina é linda
Quando a gente vai dormir e ainda é quando acordar
Ela é um poço de qualidade e defeito
E cada jeito dela é uma emoção
Toda mulher causa um efeito que esconde
Que seu corpo perfeito
É só um convite pro que ela tem no coração

Se eu sussurrar, escuta, se eu balançar, segura
Se eu gaguejar, me entende, se eu duvidar, me jura
Se eu te amar, me sente, se eu te tocar, se assanha
Se eu te olhar, sorri, se eu te perder, me ganha
Se eu te pedi, me da, se for brigar, pra que?

Que passe o tempo, que se modifique em mares
Que a paz se solidifique em todos os lares
Que após o carro a moda seja as astronaves
Mas que a nossa graça permaneça igual o programa do Chaves

Eu sei que tudo vai mudar

Projota,"Cada inimigo seu vai te aplaudir de pé
Quando seu escudo for o seu olhar, e sua espada a sua fé!
Quando sua meta for felicidade não vitória
Quem não se foca no presente não fica pra história, irmão!
'Cê veio pra contar história ou pra escrever?
Me diz, o que realmente te faz feliz?
Sei que nem todos lá no fim do túnel buscam luz
Fica difícil se é a escuridão quem te conduz
Já vi oportunismo travestido de amizade
Uns aproveitadores da minha boa vontade
Mas me esquivei, risquei da vida os covarde
Porque quem vive em torno de mentira já tá morto de verdade
Um só caminho é o bastante, suficiente, 
Num mundo louco onde maçã te oferece serpente
Já tentaram calar minha boca, e calava,
Mas só com meu dedo do meio eu falei tudo que eu precisava

Quando cortaram os meus braços, eu chutei
Quando cortaram minhas pernas, eu dei cabeçada
Quando cortaram minha cabeça, eu mordi na jugular e não soltei por nada, não soltei por nada!
Quando cortaram os meus braços eu chutei
Quando cortaram minhas pernas eu lutei, como samurai!

Sem sensacionalismo, sem sentimentalismo, 
Ser pobre eu sou, mas querer ser, é masoquismo
Não enalteço a riqueza ou a pobreza, 
Enalteço a luta por comida à vontade na mesa de quem, 
Não teve escolha sobre a própria profissão
Se eu tive a minha, me calar é omissão, 
Faço como a as rabiola no fio, 
O vento tenta me levar, mas permaneço onde o destino me encubiu, ouviu?
Um sonho se desfaz quando o olho se abre, 
Um ideal não se desfaz nem que a vida se acabe
Meu ideal já foi traçado
'Não permitir que meu fracasso faça minha véia ir tomar banho gelado!'
Cada 'Amélia' que dá a vida pela família, 
Ama algum ""João"" que merece bem mais que uma Brasília
A gente se adaptou ao mundo feroz, 
Agora é a hora de fazer com que o mundo se adapte a nós!

Quando cortaram os meus braços, eu chutei,
Quando cortaram minhas pernas, eu dei cabeçada,
Quando cortaram minha cabeça, eu mordi na jugular e não soltei por nada, não soltei por nada!
Quando cortaram os meus braços eu chutei,
Quando cortaram minhas pernas eu lutei, como samurai!

O que diria seu pai te vendo caído, irmão?
Isso depende do motivo de se estar no chão, 
Alguns tão lá, por nem saberem levantar, 
O meu rap é a mão que se estende pra te ajudar!
Vem, sei que seu corpo 'tá cansado samurai, 
Vão derrubar seu corpo mas sua alma não cai
Eu sei que alguém acredita em você, mas e você, acredita em você?
Eu acredito em você!
Colegas? Eu tenho vinte, Amigos? Eu tenho seis 
Que eu vejo sempre? Só quatro, Que eu posso contar? Só três!
Quando eu cair, já era
Poucos aí se comove, em alma eu 'vô tá' olhando, tirando a prova dos nove!
Alguns vão falar ""Volta"", outros vão dar ""Adeus"", se foi um tal de Projota ou o Thiago morreu
Mas hoje, ainda tô vivo, não vão, comer do meu pão
Só quero deixar bem claro, os verdadeiro eu sei quem são!

Projota,"Vê se 'cê dá um abraço na sua véia
E esquece das mágoas
Antes de ver ela deitada,
Vegetando sobre um colchão d'água
2 Minutos na vida faz diferença
1 Abraço e mais 3 palavras vale mais que 'cê pensa
Eu queria
Que as neuroses que eu tenho fossem só
Sair domingo com a minha mãe
Pra visitar minha vó
No fim foi com a vó que eu cresci
E o que me faz gritar
É saber que a minha mãe tá longe demais pra nós visitar
E seja lá onde for, me olhe por favor
Não posso tocar sua pele, mas eu sinto seu amor
É foda, quando o sentimento se solta
Você chora ao ver que já passou 10 anos e ela não volta
E 'cê reclama se sua véia te manda no mercado
Reclama se a cinta estrala, mesmo se você tá errado
Reclama se ela te abraça na frente dos aliados
Vai reclamar com Deus quando ela nem estiver do seu lado

Cadê você? vem cá,
Pra me dizer, deita, dorme e sonha a vida é uma brincadeira
Quem me gerou, quem me criou, quem me ensinou viver
Sorrir, chorar, cair, amar, sentir, lutar, ganhar, perder
Viver sem ter você!

Se eu choro agora não é que eu sou fraco
É que eu tô me desmontando para depois juntar cada caco
Não é fácil olhar pra cama e ver sua mãe chacoalhando
Despertando adulto num moleque de 7 anos
Eu fiz o que tava no meu alcance pra te salvar
Só que na hora que aconteceu eu não tava lá
Tenho medo de falhar, medo que chegue no fim
E eu não tenha alcançado o que você esperava de mim
Eu não vou culpar Deus, o mundo é dos espertos
E lá no lugar dele eu também ia te querer mais por perto
Tudo que absorvi, o que contigo aprendi
É o que me fez ser homem muito antes de MC
Cada cintada nas pernas me fez aprender
Que eu tinha que ser calejado e forte pra viver sem você
E eu te dedico aqui minha melhor poesia
Composta pela alegria de ser o seu filho
E pela agonia, de ver meu pai, que é meu herói, chorando
Meu irmão gritando, minha vó entrando em pânico,
E a dor aumentava
E cada vez que eu caí nessa vida,
O quanto eu sofri nessa vida,
Chamei por ti nessa vida, e não te encontrava
Mas hoje eu sei que não fiz nada sozinho,
A cada passo, a cada respiração
Você tava dentro de mim,
Um vira-lata sem dono e sem lar
Deixa a minha cama arrumada,
Qualquer dia eu vou aí te visitar

Cadê você? vem cá,
Pra me dizer, deita, dorme e sonhe a vida é uma brincadeira
Quem me gerou, quem me criou, quem me ensinou viver
Sorrir, chorar, cair, amar, sentir, lutar, ganhar, perder

já pratiquei claramente esses 7 desde os 17 e outros 50 mais
Então, não troca de roupa, amor, o mundo te fez sentir dor
E o mundo anda tão machista que a mina se assusta se aparece um cara que te dá valor
Também pelo amor, não deixam vestir, não deixam agir, é a submissão do opressor
E no memo vagão do metrô, segue sua mãe e o estuprador
Aaaaah, os muleque é liso, sim, mas o governo é muito mais
Fácil matar dezenas de pessoas e dizer que foi por causas naturais
Tristeza demais, perdendo seus pais, perdendo sua casa, enterrada na lama
Uma missa não traz a justiça pro povo que sofre lá em Mariana
É, desgosto demais, imposto demais, como isso pode ser comum?
Um país tão imenso, extenso, propenso a nunca ser o número 1
Pobreza é jejum forçado, pobre é triste, eu vejo 1 por 1
Se o triste bebe, o Brasil é uma fábrica de bebum
Por isso eu canto, por isso eu grito
Nasci lá no canto, e vou pro infinito
Não quero ser santo, nem quero ser mito
Se eu causei espanto foi porque acredito
Que o pobre é capaz e que o negro é bonito
Assim que se faz, e aqui tenho dito
Não irrite demais porque quando eu me irrito
Eu escrevo demais e hoje foi escrito que
Não tenho partido nenhum, nem tenho pretensão de ter
Um político honesto de fato, eu sigo esperando nascer
""Brasil, mostra a sua cara"" porque se o Cazuza tivesse aqui pra ver
Que tantos anos depois é a mesma merda
Só que agora é em HD

E o metrô de São Paulo e o caso da Petrobras

É a luta do jovem, já que não resolvem, é hora da gente lutar
Da gente se unir, da gente se armar
É a homofobia sendo confrontada, é o direito de andar
De usar, de vestir, de sonhar, de sorrir, de ficar, de sair, é o direito de agir, é o direito de amar
É uma discussão
É o aborto, é a legalização
É o mundo matando o muleque e o rap sempre servindo como outra opção
É o câncer, é o stress, é a maldita depressão
É o salário mais justo para o professor, é o valor sendo dado pra educação
É o racismo na internet, no Brasil de norte a sul
É o negro a cada ano quebrando um novo tabu

Se as leis não salvam ninguém, e eu não consigo entender
O meu instinto é socar, segundo passo é correr
Terceiro passo é olhar pra trás dando risada e mandar se fuder
É que hoje em dia é tão fácil comprar, é tão fácil vender
É tão fácil usar, e eu não vou me prender
Vou injetar seu amor na minha veia derramar meu ódio na vida alheia, e transar com você
Eu vou deixar minha marca no mundo, como um legado
Uma forma de deixar registrado, um recado
Como uma tag num muro que eu pixei e marquei

As consequências com a certeza de que eu ainda sou eu
Eu te prometo que um dia acordo e apareço
Provavelmente te pedindo grana, reconheço
Mais dizendo que eu te amo sem dizer
Talvez quando eu tiver um filho eu consiga te entender

Nem tudo que eu sou equivale ao que eu prego

I don't know you, you don't know me

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

So you wanna throw down with me
So you wanna go 
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
So you wanna get loud with me

So you wanna go

Feel the weight of all I've lost
Then you place me under oath
You don't know me, you don't own my soul

Stuck on sights that can't be seen 
I play on what the world believes 
The easy way i turn to lean 
And maybe chance is all played out 
And a better man would have figured 
How to finally understand 
And turn around 
But my better man just won't come out 
Tears that ask me if I care 
Replacing words she never shared 
It's not worth it to feel the pain 
As I'm not worth her time of day 

And why why can't I keep from crying 
And why why do these tears keep calling your name 
I you know I can't stop lying trying fighting this pain",Better Man

Holding on to broken hearts
Memories are what's left of us
You're trying to hard to be my friend

And I'm placing all our pictures
In these broken frames
To remind me to never fall in love again

I'm sorry, won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
Hope you realize you threw away
The best thing that ever happened to you

Forget my name and forget my face
Hope you hit your head and your memory gets erased
So I never have to deal with you again

And away we go
And away we go
And away we go
And away we go

And you're falling faster than a shooting star
That you wished your own body on
So wake up to the sound of the radio
Crashing through your window
Through your window, through your window

I'm sorry, won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away
The best thing that ever happened to you

Forget my name, forget my face
Hit your head and your memory gets erased

Promise of Redemption,"It's hard to believe much of anything these days
When every thing falls all around you what can you say
When all of the words that float so easily just won't come
It's hard to believe that my whole body can feel this numb

Just try to remember

Been twirling my hair, that same habit you know that I have
When I close my eyes this whole situation just seems so bad
But I still got a memory, these pictures of you will never leave my side
And Lord knows I'm hurting, but every one knows it hurts to say goodbye

It's just the one thing I've been having the most trouble with
Is when I try my best, you know I do to just describe
The way that when you looked at me it's like it's heaven sent
And those most beautiful eyes

And I've been waking up at night beside this nervous tick
?Cause I just don't know if it's possible to get through this
And it's just me and all of your best friends they're by my side
They're trying, oh so hard to wipe these tears of off my eyes

Just try to remember

Just how it felt
Just how it felt

I find it hard to believe that you were taken from me
And all of your family, it doesn't make sense
How all these pictures and frames makes it hard to explain
The way that it rains, it's you crying

So I'll hold on to belief that one day we?ll be at peace
And when you look down on me you know I'm trying
Just to show the whole world how amazing you are
And when I see all those stars I know you're shining

No matter what record label I gotta spit the truth
The illest troop you can't keep a good sound down
In Tokyo my shit is heard around town
I'm screamin' on emcees: unless you drop gems please
Shut the fuck up, hand over your benz' keys
The way I see things in Europe, nobody's fuckin' with this
And in the states, well I don't really want to dis
But some rappers take hip hop for granted
Watch me run up in their spot like Moh and Mike mechanic

Your fan base is your man's place they thought your tape was aight
Since you ain't nothing in the streets you pose to be a club thug
All hyped up but never really done shit like that millennium bug

I'm in this to rip the clubs, decks and microphones
In Tokyo and former Russia
Informers rush the set 'cause of we hollerin' anarchy like Busta
And cuss the downpressor men from the top of my lungs
Till they start makin' sense and be dropppin' their guns
Once my crew gets to speak out they freak out
This ain't supposed to leak out we ain't supposed to sneak out
The back door with black dough, Loop Troop is like whoa
Conquerin' the world in two triple O's
So do panic, that bull shit can it

Nobody boo us they more like sayonara
Glad you came, it's the bomb! Aight peace we feel honored

And travel to the other side of the planet to perform
I look to the east (why?) yo do I even have to mention it
This western world got us trapped in censorship
'Cause everything that I say is political
And everything that I write makes me a suspected criminal
Subliminal advertising behind enemy lines
You'll find the message between the lines when you rewind

Shit son I got my notice of eviction
next day they hit me with an unjust conviction
What is this fiction? I ain't in to superstition
but somebody's on a mission to fuck with me
Everybody's in on it from record labels to travel agents
to government agents and radio stations
And people cancelling shows those damn silly hoes
same cowards that won't air our videos
Too hot for TV and banned from radio
and when's the album droppin' fans are waiting yo
This one is for y'all I hope you're hearing me
we all got a job to combat the conspiracy...

Against DVSG's
every single industry always deceiving me
It's a conspiracy against DVSG's
they're out to get Embee, Cosmic, Supreme and me

After I wrote this rhyme I hade to eat the paper
and after hearing this rhyme you might meet your maker
Cus anybody with this knowledge is considered a risk
so if you see the police kid get rid of the disc
And if you're scared of getting family members murdered
turn the music off right now pretend you never heard it
Any brave soul still out there ready to hear my story
about how the whole world is conspiratory
Nah I'm not paranoid I always got a pair of boys
in blue on the look out for me and my crew
It's a fact the government consider our music a threat
and they ain't happy until Loop Troop crew's in a net
They want us losing our necks to keep the fool's in a check
but yo schlooks and schlookettes they ain't ruling us yet
They want to stop our communication with the world's population
cus on popular demand we bring hip hop emancipation

[Bridge]
They want to shoot us up they want to shoot us down
they want to lock us up they want to lock us down.
They want to bruck us up they want to bruck us down
they want to fuck us up they bring the ruckus now.

They don't like the likes of us
They don't like the lines I bust
They do like to fight and fuss
and claim that I don't have the right to cuss
Well I keep spitting till the mike a rust
I keep giving that type of rush
I make the youths them hype enough
for po po to pull out the nines and cuffs
And I smash their face red like a blush
I turn the crowd into psycho thugs
I turn hip hop spots into biker clubs
and make the scene explode like dynamite and such
And they can't stop this fire burning
they can't top this higher learning
They got cops and sly attorneys
foolish dogs keep barkin' at this flying bird it's...

At a faster pace than formula 1 racing
Blaming the problems of society, on immigration
When in Sweden may guns export it to poor nations
Causing wars and starvation's
Killing Africans and Asians
Calling it ""foreign relations""
And it's all an annihilation's
Yo, you forced them to leave their homeland
For an unknown land

Watch the evil world they create
And how they celebrate their great state
Thx 1138, if you're real you can relate
To how they watch every move we make
And how they decimate the human race
Well if this ain't the last days
Then it sure is pretty late

I see hate (no face) in the eyes on the walls
And it's hard to show love back they freeze ice on your balls
It's a cold world despite the green house effect
They fight the fact that my team got respect
To them my team's a suspect and I admit you can't trust us
But ain't no justice it's just us the small time hustlas
Being thoroughly inspected
Every day and every night we're being casted and directed
In the world's greatest soap opera Truman show for true man, yo
I'm not stupid I won't stoop down low
Although I creep on a diggi low cus bigger bro
want to broadcast my ass live on a video
But I escape the big screen and the piggsvin
Team up with the dope friends to put up a smoke screen
To blind your cameras eye sight too much unwanted limelight
It's not like I get a spot light cus I rhyme tight
But cus of their so called crime fight that's why I use my mic
To let the vandals and the thiefs of the world know the time's right
If you hate the system unite tonight
Tomorrow when we wake up it'll be allright

[Chorus]

Every action has it's reaction what you expected?
This actor without a pay check will react with hatred
I stay dread burn and loot what they hold sacred
Incarcerated scarred faces but we can make it
On the low in between the lines like me and Timbuk
We've been fucked too long to just lay down and give up
So big up all the disobedient crews
The deviant crews who don't believe in the news
Who be seeing straight thrue the lies with their eyes on the prize
Freedom, don't give a fuck about ice
The spies lurk on every street corner
Record every move you make like big brothers of Warner
They shoot a reel then they shoot you for real
To hold you still they give you alcohol and pills
If you feel like graffiti is more than just a fashion
It's lights, camera, legal action!

You heard about all your other dances

But now there's a brand new dance that's going around
I want to show you exactly what I'm talking about
I'm talking about the funky chicken, y'all ready?
I say y'all ready, okay, here we go

You raise the left arm up and your right arm too
Let me tell you just what to do, start both of 'em to flapping
Start your feet to kicking, that's when you know
You doin' the funky chicken

Slick and spasm, you put both arms up, across your face
You knees start wiggling, all over the place
You flap your arms and your feet start kicking
Then you know you doin' the funky chicken

Oh, I'm feeling it now, I feel so unnecessary
This is the kind, this is the kind of stuff
To make you feel like you want to do something nasty
Like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt
Right down front, here we go y'all

You work both arms and you work both feet
Use a dab of gravy, you right on the beat
You flap your arms and your feet start kicking
Then you know, you doin' the funky chicken

It's the bliss that's a rush so rush my wrists in the cuffs
It's like a fight for yo' attention and love
Speakin of Bugz, give me a hint from above
If he not you know I wanna be sent when I'm done
Kid outta wedlock so my lady's frontin
I love Em, cause he gave me somethin
A positive anything is better than a negative nothin
I was on the edge of death ready to jump in
It's hard when you can't find love anywhere
And just because the reverend listen, don't mean he care
Pops on crack with a sufferin past
I dream in black and white, the world color me bad
Other than sad, painful and stress
Life is good with the webs that, tangle with death
Control the border, control the school

Hella game plus sex, she got the play
""BRRING BRRING!"" (Can I suck your cock today?)
Yes you may babe, do lots of things
What good is havin a head and not no brains?
She asked me if I know 50 and who made ""Tipsy""
Quick to get with me, quicker to get busy
She dizzy cause the Issey smell good on me
Plus she love to fuck, I mean the hood won't leave
Headed out the door and she pullin on my sleeve

I'm really wonderin if you acceptin applications
I like them facin forward chicks with the bar bellies
I pass them young hoes off to Mr. R. Kelly
Gimme a bad bitch, that can make her ass shake
I don't want you nasty, I want you nas-tay
My last day on earth I'll be fuckin a freak
That spend a half an hour just suckin my meat (yeahhh)

Flailing pigeon, her broken feet
Frozen solid to the freezing pavement.

Commune before like dime-store shrines.
Are these but votive lives?

That shores-up each of us.
Anything to dull the pain
Of a splintered lotus gait.

As for me a filigree of psychic police tape
Tends to cordon-off the darker scenes.
But the wandering mind stumbles through it
And relives them all eventually.

On the guilt, the fear, the shame.

Sometimes I feel lost in the sauce
When it comes down to who's the boss, am I being too soft?
Feenin' for your love and your special attention
Trying to get you to look in my direction

Eh you 'bout straight, put a cake in your oven
Got to see me to get the good lovin'
Wanna get the chance to sex and romance ya
On the dance floor, yeah you want more

I'm wit your girlfriends on the weekend
I give you all types of freakin' now you tell me you're leavin'
Girl get a grip 'cause I'm hittin' all angles
You know how the game goes, you gon' feel shameful

Who would ever think life could be so nice
Everything's love til you find out the price
You're saying you're sick of the same routine

Can't separate life from a floor style dream
You wanna take a look split from the scenes
When you thought you got a grip it's true you lost steam
Kick start strain but you can't find step

In your place is a stud with a bit more pep
Little less rep secret well kept
Aid her when you need every night you slept
Heard it all before can't believe it came true

Hard to see what a good party'll do
What ya gon' do? Listen to your crew
Shoulda took a better look
At who's sleeping with you

Every time I turn around you're lookin' for somethin' new
Talkin' 'bout who got to find something else to do
Who you wit' and what you want is just a fantasy
That's why I keep tellin' you your ass need to be with me

Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill

They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

Never ever ever gonna let you go

With the way you cold love me down
I don't want to sit down, I just want to get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to

Straight from the north side of town with the gangsta frown
Evergreen niggas brought the clown cause we bull n shit
With the prophet posse and the whole fuckin triple six

Like collecting guns just for fun stackin dead bodies
If you think I'm all rap and just a coward on the floor
Turn your fuckin nuts and bring it out the front door, ho

We won't hesitate to pull your whole cart
And all the hoods you bangin you slangin for you bar

I don't bar no bitch, or a nigga
I pull triggas, won't fight, i tright to hit ya
If you bigger, you gonna fall, or try to crawl
Then I ball on your face, with chrome rims, or black walls
Late at night, I'm super tight, stay out of sight
With a scope pointed at a car, with blue lights (blue lights)
You know what I mean, with the stripes run up on ya, like OJ Simpson
With a knife, on your wife, or your kids

Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

As we break the cryptic morning with a bullet and a prayer
The steel never seemed more cold and agile than now
And life never seems less vital and fragile

With a heart that's beating louder than my own
I watch a woman they call Kezia
I watch a woman that I know
I watch my hopes and my own future blindfolded
To atone for a sin I didn't care for, but a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children and burned my smiles and cigarettes

And no one ever said that hope would be so beautiful
And no one ever said I'd have to pull the trigger on her

I can't even still her trembling hands that were locked up by the dutiful and obligated;

Five soldiers forever sedated with the,
""No one's responsible"" psychological drama of our social justice dribble
Her tiny steps tell lies about the choice I have to make;
Resurrect a static lifetime starve to death my own mistakes
Pull the screaming trigger and watch your carcass bleed me dry
Or drop the gun and try to shake away the blindfold from your eyes?

Drop the gun Drop the gun

Punch your grimaced face until every last knuckle breaks
And bleeds in resistance to my sidewalk painting

Attempting composure before a bullet in the mouth answers the questions of exposure
And God of Sunday School façades and paycheques to validate the time I served abroad
It all means nothing if I forget why I'm here
To serve and protect my fist over fist mind under matter career
That's why a man sounds kind of funny when he falls to his knees
With his hand on his throat while he begs you to please spare his life
While I explain the hardest of bodies dulls the softest of knives

It's true that tactless teem totem-poles turn tolerance to tired taboos
It's true that a bullet never knocks on the door, it's about to come crashing through

Doing it in tattered shoes that aren't even mine
Because my own are in a box locked up with possessions I can't have
Like the gunman with his future and the prison priest's golden calf

But glanced at me in ways that brought to life my sleeping fears
That today you'll bite my neck and peel away the aging skin
Expose the lifeless body and the void divinity within

After twenty years of fighting young heretics and killers
I watch my temple fall to pieces at the first signs of oncoming weather
Fell to my knees just like Jesus in the cave, knew I would die
But my lips could only; I am not your son, so why have you forsaken me?

That's ever been bulletproof
Which turned out to be the closest thing to a fashion trend

And you never thought your life would be lived inside a coffin with a moral sacrifice and a million social obligations,

So when you bled on the bed as you fed those expectations as a whore and not a human
You embraced with hesitation the very parameters of all you can be

In the empty place between better and worse
Language unravels and irony hurts.

The words that confine the ideas traversed the ear

Utter first, the burst into nothing so sudden and soft.

In your right hand cast a spear.

For invading our frontier

The stone is placed above us all

Forge our weapons in the furnace,
Soar to heights like oak trees tall

I will not head your appeals
With your final words be
Grateful you died by Irish steel

Do not crawl before us,
For your fate has been revealed
The heavens will not,
Desecrate their gates with your admittance

Be gratefully you died by Irish steel

Or you could stand for a dog that's not your own because your own damn dog is next.
I'm proud of every pit bull, but ashamed of my own country.
I oppose any legislature that should try and stop me
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you'll have to pry them
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you'll have to pry them
I won't stop until they lift these, these ridiculous bans.

A loss of control, the sky swallows whole.
Spinning down, down.
Forever falling down, down, down.
 
But is it entirely a flightless fall?
No deceptive currents, no rise at all?
Maybe it?s too naive to not jump ship
when deviating so drastically from the initial script.
 
Tremble beneath the weight of inevitability,
and all the casualties therein.
Cower in the shadow of the ever-present sun,
witness eclipsing, eclipsing, eclipsed.

Are all the facts before us a masquerade?
Suffering no deceit, no selfish lies,

waking up to blazing heat

No ambiguous hypothesis to comprehend.
No bruised and battered egos in descent?s entire ethos.
No magnificent creation myth. No wind to pad the story with.
Only I will never quit, or watch my brothers quit,
but I?ll lower down a lifeboat if you?re abandoning the ship.
?True sailing?s dead,? should have been the first thing said
before the writing could be written, before the writing could be read.
 
The wreckage was never found,
but the black box was recovered.
The message therein profound.
In our final moments our true names are all discovered.
So let it fall, fall. Even if it turns out to be futile,

It stretched; diluted and extended its head

But when it encountered the Earth
It took a deep draw in, extended its arms, and leapt into the sky

It took wing over mountain and rode on the wind
It traveled the cities but as the sun dimmed
It grew fat and it cursed at the earth

It spat and began to give birth

Provenance,"So it's a fact now
What should have been flooded
The best years of my life down the drain
So I'm on the bed
I hate the heart for pumping
Things will never be the same

Wish I was dead and no one cared
Wish I was dead and that I cared

Off to fight despair
Truthfully I really should have been aware
I clench my fist
So I bite down hard, I won't go out like this
Yes, you'll find me there at the barricades

I'll see you at the barricades
Meet you there at the barricades

So I'm at the front
I hate my heart for pumping
Things will always be the same
It always ends like this
Always has and always will
You're all the same

Wish you were dead and no one cared

Provenance,"Racing rain-drenched roads of dimness, the incessant
Light-pulse
Invades your privacy, heading nowhere special
An indecisive gaze at nothing as your mind's drawn blank
And outside features start to fade
Sad to see you end this way, chasing your self-hatred
Streetlights flashing by in thousands, the city traffic's
Round the bend
Seems your number has come up, it's closing stages now
Look, here comes the end

As the pulses intensity, a shimmer on the pallor of your
Face
You see the crash and press down hard, somehow to ease
The impact
You know you should have hit the brakes, what a fucking
Waste
The way the world just smashed right into your face
So many things you should have done, the spans you could
Have run

Prowizorka Jazz Band,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

God bless her
Wherever she may be

Showin' love to my niggas who show me love in Chicago
It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it
Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it
Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it
Thank him for everything and every blessin' but don't fake it

Trapped up in this wild life, thinkin' to myself
Askin' the Lord for forgiveness and thankin' him for my wealth
The block is on low when these slickers ain't plantin' drugs
Saturated with racial hatred result in a slug
That's why I stay high, gone off green
Fuckin' up motherfuckers lyrically with the Beam
Got you and yo boys losin' yo breath like ?
Never disrespect a Legit Balla when on the scene
Oh wee I rip shit like velcro
Get off in the studio 
Fuck up the punk that step up got the umm next nigga screamin' ""Oh No""
Just when you thought that I was goin' fall I fuck around and ummm

Hit you with some shit that make you shake and shiver as I deliver

Seems that we've grown older
And time has beat us
Seems I've forgotten who to be

My heart, my soul, my sweetest memories

Where laughter used to be
Empty house surrounds me
And echos our history

To find a way
To bring us back to yesterday

Still everything to me

And wonder if you could be looking at me

Spring time on the Island of Corfu
I was lost and asked for help
You were teaching at the local school
We talked a while and then made plans 
While all the children laughed at me and you
They could see the way we felt 
Much before either of us knew

Walked together hand in hand
A stranger from a foreign land but soon, 
mornings turned to afternoons 
And dinners turned to making love 
To you, to you

Cocktails on the patio at noon
You waved to me from out at sea
And I considered staying there with you
I watched the sunlight dancing through your hair
And like a ghost of history
I don't know why
My heart just died
I realized that it could never be

Circumstance and broken dreams 
Like satellites with laser beams from above
Tracked me down and found us out
And filled my head 
And made me doubt 
This love of ours

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied

I just never took the time

Kurzes Drive-by in der Stadt
Murkse ein paar Wichser ab, Schurken-like, der Richter suckt
'Ne supergeile Hipster-Slut, kurvenreich und splitternackt
Komm zum Höhepunkt, während mein stubenreiner Pitbull kackt
Gute Reise, fick dich, Spast, ich packe mal wieder Mac 10
Gut, wenn's mit den Hits nicht klappt, dann rappe mal lieber wie Ekrem
Zieh Leine, mach die Beine los, du fetter Verlierer musst wegrenn'
Zeig mir deine Scheine und ich stecke den Lilanen weg, man
'Ne Kette, die mir bis zum Sack hängt
Das ist mein Markenzeichen
Ich komm vorbei und dann werd ich dir in den Garten scheißen
'Ne Bitch auf Warteschleife, sie sagt mir, Ek, was geht?
Du bist der Burner in mein' Augen, Pfefferspray

Euer Camping ist vorbei
Das ist Gangster-Shit am Mic,
Renn zur Polizei, Stuttgarter Hügelset
Wo ich in der Hood grad paar Brüder treff

Ein Gangster und ein Hipster, Welten prallen aufeinander

Ein Gangster und ein Hipster, Gegensätze ziehen sich an

Sieh uns an, jeder ist auf dieses Feature gespannt

Ich nehme die Verfolgung auf,
Mit vollem Lauf, Inglebird Holocaust
Halt dein vermummtes Maul und lauf, lauf, du Opfer, lauf
Ich schieß dir gezielt ins Knie
Fülle deine Wunde mit einer Packung Salz
Piss rein, bis du schreist und hänge dir ein Lasso um den Hals
Binde dich an 'ne Laterne, behandel dich wie 'nen schmutzigen Hund
Hör auf zu bellen, du Kelb, oder ich stopfe dir meinen stinkenden Strumpf in den Mund
Bin innen Terrorist und außen brav, trag ein' Turban aus 'nem Schaf
Früher hätt ich Menschen getötet für 1000 Mark
Aber heute sind es 1000 Euro oder mein freier Wille
Wie aus heiterem Himmel fällt ein Scheiß-Schrei in der Stille
Ich stecke so tief in der Scheiße, bekomme die Beine nicht raus
Ich lege mir noch ein paar Scheine zur Seite, dann steig ich aus

Ey, Eko, ich hab grad unseren Song gehört,
Warum hast du jetzt 'nen Gangster-Part gemacht?
Wie? Was meinst du jetzt?
Ja, das Konzept war doch ein Gangster und ein Hipster, oder?
Ja, aber ich bin doch kein Hipster!
Ich bin auch kein Hipster.
Ich hab gedacht, wenn von uns beiden einer ein Hipster ist, dann du
Nenene, ich hab gedacht, du bist der Hipster,
Also, ich bin auf keinen Fall 'n Hipster
Und ich bin erst recht kein Hipster, ich bin ganz normaler Gangsta

Yo, uh eh

Noch 3 Stunden fahr'n, jap, bis wir da sind

Lehn' dich zurück, alles cool, wenn wir harzen
Fenster nicht auf, es ist drin, du musst atmen
3-Meter-Spliff, wir rollen über Straßen
Im Anschlag ? und die Scheiben getönt, weil wir Stars sind
Jap und jeden Tag ein Trip
Hier und da ein Gig und immer wieder big
Ich bin nie allein, denn ich häng mit der Clique
Und jedes Mädchen, das ich kenn' ist 'ne Pscht
Ich komm in deine Stadt mit 8 km/h
Mach die Nacht zum Tag, denn ich mach, was ich mag
Deine Stadt ist gebannt, also mach mal Alarm

Richtung Stuggi zum City, nenn mich Michi zum Schumi
Brudi, Baba Hafti, ich komm an mit deiner Cousine
Sie lutscht Schwanz in der Limousine, auch wenn er nur geleast ist
Fahr durch den Kiez von Hamburg City im Lamborghini
Mintgrüner Lack, Flügeltüren hoch,
Alter, ich fliege, Habibi, Arab Boeing 747
Weil ich Risiko so liebe
Auf den Chromfelgen spiegel'n sich die Linien der Straße
Die Schlampe nimmt den Spiegel und legt Linien für die Nase
Ich roll zwar auf der Street, doch bin high wie die NASA
Der Wagen Automatik wie die Cartier, die am Arm hängt
Wir sind international unterwegs, Barbie
Heute in Miami Beach, morgen in Paris
Maserati, Bugatti, Mercedes, Ferrari

Loch rein, Alk rein, alle oben ohne
Vergiss mal den Sambuca, int'ressiert mich nicht die Bohne
Das Konfetti regnet auf die Leute, Feuer wie Kanonen
Vorher war Plinch noch Brownies backend in seim' Haus
Und jetzt steht er auf dem Tresen und ist unheilbar gut drauf
Ein Typ will ein Autogramm, ich geb ihm einen Stift
Und sag, Geilheit ist Steilheit in Spiegelschrift, schreib das auf
Er lässt nicht locker, fragt, was bei mir so geht
Ich sag, Alter, verkauf einfach mal 'n Braten, celebrate
2 Stunden später, ich mach grad so meine Truck-Moves
Da kommt er wieder und sagt: Ich rap auch, pass auf, hör zu

Doch heute läuft nix, meine Freundin macht mal kurz Serato aus
Mein Handy läutet, Beethovens Neunte
Oder an die Freude, verteil Wodka an die Freunde
Deine Freunde müssen draußen bleiben und von drinnen träumen
Kurzer Augenkontakt mit 'nem vollkommenen Spast
Der sich angesprochen fühlt, bist du öfter hier, Schatz?
Auf die Frage, ob ich heute Abend mit ihm nach Hause geh
Sag ich, sprich zu der Hand, und auf meiner Hand steht

Nachdem Mama ihn vom Kindergarten abgeholt hat
Die Klamotten, nicht sein Ernst, das ist echt zu hart
Fehlt nur noch 'ne Brille mit 'nem Sticker auf dem rechten Glas
Vielleicht bin ich zu alt oder er zu jung
Aber die Hosen sind doch viel zu eng, das ist nicht mehr gesund
Ich bin in Biggie seiner Herde, bis ich sterbe und
Da läuft bei mir dann G.O.D. Part 3 auf der Beerdigung
Jetzt pass mal auf, Kleiner
Noch so'n Produzenten-Album braucht keiner
Ich mein, sowas steht im Laden und verstaubt leider
Und wenn es jemand braucht, wird's nicht gekauft
er klaut's einfach
Da wo du wohnst, ist's bestimmt weit und breit ländlich
Sieh es ein, mein Freund, kein Schwein kennt dich

Wenn alles, was nach Punkt X kam, wird es gleich interpretiert
Schublade auf und alles rein, ein Blick genügt, du denkst, du weißt
Der Schein trügt, nicht alles, was glitzert, ist Gold, obwohl man's meint
Heut sieht es so aus, morgen anders, wir verlieren den Überblick
Mit Scheuklappen an den Augen, sehen wir nur das, was man uns sehen lässt
Und das, was wir uns denken, ist das, was wir verwenden
Sehen Großes, wo Kleines dahintersteckt, lassen uns blenden
Alles schwarz-weiß
Wir sind nicht frei, liegen in Ketten, denn uns blendet der Schein
Wir entdecken die Welt neu, doch ernten Blicke, die uns nicht versteh'n
Augen, die uns anstarr'n, sie können kein Unterschied seh'n
Die Hände gebunden, die Augen vermummt
Das Ende gefunden, die Jalousien lassen's verdunkeln

Mit dem will sicher sowieso keiner auf einen Track
(Oh) Ich hab die Lieder schon vorab bekomm'
Ich hab sie angehört und hab sie hassen woll'n
Und eigentlich ham' sie ja Recht, das ist genau mein Ding
Doch dann ist da ein Track von Haftbefehl, ich glaub, ich spinn
Von mir wird ohne Scheiße jeder gefickt
Aber ich battle doch nicht den, der ist stärker als ich
Was für ein Move, ihr müsst denken, dass ich dumm bin
Battlen gegen Haft? Chimperator will mich umbring'n
Also nein, leider bin ich raus
Indianer-Ehrenwort, der Psaiko.Dino hat es drauf
Ich hab's gehört und find vor allem das mit Hafti geil
Wie sieht's aus? Darf ich trotzdem auf dem Album sein?

Sie wollten, dass ich die CD von Psaiko.Dino check
Und ham' gefragt, ob ich da nicht mal eben Zeit für hätt
Da wären immer zwei MCs zusamm' auf einem Track
Die nicht zusammenpassen, was für ein Scheiß-Konzept

Psaiko.Dino,"Direkt aus meinem Rezeptblock, verschreibungspflichtig
Mir sind meine Patienten und deren Meinung wichtig
ist der Zeitpunkt richtig? fragt sie die Probanden, wie sie's so fanden
und ob sie davor das Risiko kannten
Die erste Langzeitstudie, keine Angst, nein, es tut nicht weh
Euer Wohlergeh'n steht im Vordergrund, dickflüssiges Morphium
Nur ein paar nichtsnützige Schiffsbrüchige sind über Bord gesprung'n
Doch ich sorg mich um jeden einzelnen Privatpatient
Der meine Leistungen in Anspruch nimmt und seit neustem auch Viagra kennt
Denn dann freut sich auch die Partnerin
Sexgott
Alles, was du brauchst, direkt aus meinem Rezeptblock
Und deine Schmerzen geh'n weg, denn unser Gift ist betäubend
99 der 100 wichtigsten Deutschen könn' es dir bezeugen, Poison

Reich mir das Gift und die Schmerzen geh'n weg
Ich reis in meinem Zimmer in eine andere Welt
All diese Blätter, die die Welt bedeuten

Nur der reinste Wirkstoff
Das Dope ist gestreckt, doch die Schmerzen sind weg
Placeboeffekt
Placeboeffekt

Du musst das Gift richtig dosier'n, denn dein Herz macht gleich schlapp
Obwohl ich dir stets bloß Placebos verabreicht hab
Du kannst mit dei'm Kopf immer durch die Wand oder auch mal die Ansicht teil'n
Du hast zwar Angst, denn er ist der Boss und er macht dich krank, doch er kann dich heil'n
Denn hast du dein Lächeln einmal verlor'n
hast du dein' besten Einfall verworfen
Du bist ständig auf der Suche
willst dich rächen, es heimzahl'n, der Zorn, hat dich vereinnahmt
einsam, du würdest Finderlohn zahl'n
Nur der Schmerz, der immer noch strahlt
Hausbesuche, lindern die Qual'n
Auch wenn dein weicher Kern von außen hart ist
Es geht hier alles um die Vertrauensbasis, wie als wenn du ein Frauenarzt bist
Als ich klein war, wollt ich auch kein' Traubenzucker
Ein Querulant mit Bewegungsdrang, der die Placebos dann einfach ausgespuckt hat
Und auch das Futter meines Anoraks konnt' nicht verbergen
Erst war ich fett und dann wieder anorax, doch ohne Schmerzen

Zieh dich aus, schließ die Augen und vergiss die Zeit

Lass die Ängste frei, komm, wir fliegen in ein Meer aus Wein
Psaiko.Dino begleitet uns, wir bleiben zeitlos
Der Beat nimmt uns den Sinn, sie einzukalkulier'n
Ich will nicht weg, geh nicht weg, nein, wir bleiben hier
Komm, wir bleiben hier, komm, wir bleiben hier
Steig' ein, wir geben Gas, der Pfeil vom Kompass zeigt Richtung Mars
Vorbei an der Sonne im Raumschiff, wenn der Treibstoff uns gleich ausgeht
Geh'n wir weiter nach einer Pause, treffen eigenartige Clowns auf
Dem Weg so laut, wie zehn auf, du lebst auch nur einmal

Ist keinmal
Nur wer doppelt sieht, macht zweimal
Wer nicht doppelt sieht, macht alles nur einmal
Ist keinmal
Nur wer doppelt sieht, macht es zweimal
Lass uns laut sein, auch wenn wir nur schweigen
Alles kommt nie wieder, nur die Kopfschmerzen bleiben

Clap your hands, drink some Moet

Dis-moi, quel genre de filles veux-tu être dans ce monde-là?
Les dalmatiens que nous sommes, n'aimons pas les Cruella
Et on ne sait pas regarder dans les yeux, #AndersonPamela
Tu dis que tu veux du respect de la poésie et des roses
Un mec qui te fait un bébé, mais qu'il ait des liasses dans les poches
Un beau gosse comme Trey Songz qui te fait l'amour comme personne
Si j'ai bien compris tu veux un mec
Qui te fasse grimper le ciel comme King Kong
Tu ne veux pas de pingpong avec une autre
Tu me dis que les filles que décrivent IAM

Super fraîche dans ta Mini, tu veux un mari
Ou bien tu cherches le profit, t'es naturelle
Ou siliconée dans le bikini, tu crois au ciel
Ou au portefeuille plein de illets-bi, baby
Une fois tu l'aimes, une fois tu l'aimes plus
Les boites, les chichas ont foutus en l'air toutes tes études
Expérimentée, réservée, dentelle ou pucelle

Tu connais les secrets de Victoria, t'aimes toute sa lingerie fine

Elle aime les mots doux, à force elle va tomber
Un jour sur un fou, pour son 90C
Miss indépendante voit la vie fraîchement au boulot

Psy 4 de la Rime,"Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Poto
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Essayez de trouver un équilibre au milieu de tout ce bordel
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Assumer ses choix et ses défaites
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Le king de ma life

Celui qui se contente de peu ne manque de rien
Voilà comment je mène ma vie, je combats mes faux besoins au quotidien
Ici le clinquant t'empêche de voir le bon chemin
Pour mieux le voir, c'est le cœur qu'a besoin d'un opticien
Voilà pourquoi mes vers gardent un œil sur les miens
Et qu'il y a des larmes dans le regard de mes alexandrins
Je sais pas faire semblant, le monde va mal, wake up
L'amour est cardiaque donc je rappe comme un peacemaker
Toujours humble et discret
Un vrai n'expose pas ses actes à la lumière comme un trophée
Je boxe avec les mots #SopraBomayé
Mais le rap fait pas le poids face à l'urgence de mon foyer
Le din m'a appris le love
Il m'a appris que la liberté s'arrête là où commence celle des autres
Homme de parole, les miens me connaissent
Mon succès n'est pas un vœux mais plutôt une promesse car

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je suis le king de ma life, vu qu'il y a qu'une place sur le trône
Difficile de dicter et d'assumer ses choix
Mettre le king c'est tranchant comme dans Game Of Thrones
Et de surcroît, sans ta famille t'es rien faut me croire
Je traverse la vie en solitaire, #VendéeGlobe
Poséidon me mène la vie dure à chaque cap
Je navigue comme François Gabart, voilà l'époque
Dur de garder la place one quand t'es dans une barque
King de ma life, king de ma life
Gardez vos ceintures et vos rings la mienne est au doigt de ma wife
Chaque jour est un fight pour accroître ma foi
Je remercie le seigneur et lève mon verre chaque night (King!)
Comme T.I. à Atl
Maman soit heureuse, ton fils a pris le temps d'ouvrir ses ailes (King!)
Car à chacun sa bonne étoile
La mienne n'est pas sur Hollywood, mais dans le cœur, man

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je réanime ma joie quand elle se fait percuter pas les soucis
Je suis king de ma life et ça depuis mon premier cri
J’apprends à me connaître pour éviter le feu
Car je suis mort en 1982
Et tu peux dire aux non-croyants que Dieu existe
Ne pas le reconnaître c’est comme s’enquiller 10 litres
Et rester droit sur un pupitre
Je ferai partie de ceux qui se soumettent
Car je suis le king de mon être
J’ai toujours le choix, même les difficiles
Je suis maître de moi, l’avouer c’est pas facile
Quand je me comporte comme un ignorant perdu
Habillé je ne me suis jamais senti aussi nu
Tu te rappelleras que je parlai de mon environnement
Légal ou illégal, ils seront là à mon enterrement
Souvent j’ai tiré au canon pour écraser une punaise
J’ai envie de dire au diable que je le baise

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Yes I'm so damn ready
You could put a crown on my head
I'm not bougie bougie
I'll give the shirt off my back

Sincères et vrais depuis tellement d'albums
Les chevilles anorexiques car le succès ne t'épargne pas d'la tombe
Tant qu'il y'aura des hommes aux discours qui divisent
Je rapperais l'addition de nos différences sur tout mes dises
J'traverse le temps sans avoir de douane
Entre Eminem et Balavoine, préviens la France, on repart en croisade

On repart en croisade, c'est le chant de Mars
On passe du rire au larme, on est véritable
Ton quartier nous connait, ton quartier nous connait
Ils en font des tonnes pour se faire connaître
Nous on traverse le temps à bord d'une comète
Ton quartier nous connait, ton quartier nous connait

On repart en croisade pour les quartiers d'France de la planète Mars
Un retour pour les supporters qui se défoncent
C'est la voie des blocks, tu reconnais la classe
Quand Alonzo, Vinc', Sopra', Sya se défoncent
Mon son résonne dans ton block, tu m'connais
Entend les échos du concert, le public nous connait
Nouveau tracklist, rap #4D
Original Gangsta, la Psy te fait la bise
Lèves ta main en l'air, si ton quartier nous connait
On est toujours dans l'ère du temps, oui on s'est cramponnés
On est des aigles, viens nous voir en haut de la montagne
Si tu bats de l'aile (Man!), évite de vouloir prendre la gagne!
Man, 2012 on vient vous prendre de volée, mon rap sort de l'usine, #SiliconValley
Préviens les quartiers d'France et de Navarre, Psy 4!

Un contrat à honorer à chaque fois
Des concerts à travers l'Europe, l'Afrique et l'Canada

Animer sa flamme, pas celle des stroboscopes
Pour danser seul dans ses bras
T'es ma Valentine mais là y'a un truc qui cloche
Arrête de me faire la thug
Change de refrain avant que s'éteigne la torche
Que tu n'retrouves plus la douceur de mes bras
J'fais la fête, j'fais la fête, oh oui, j'aime ça
M'évader loin des problèmes d'la vie, j'te jure, rien qu'ça
Le DJ a commencé à mixer faut que j'donne ça
Bounce, bounce, come on, dance avec ou sans toi
La musique dans la peau, c'est elle qui contrôle mes déhanchés
Pas la belle, là devant moi, qui essaye de me coincer
Le verre reste glacé, toujours aromatisé
T'inquiète, toujours lucide, les condés pourront me faire pisser

T'es la mienne Ilias, amis ou ennemis
Tu verras bien qu'c'est sur moi qu'il faudra qu'tu comptes
L'argent ça vient, ça part comme avec certain amis
Ton imagination? (Non!) Je suis bien réel
Les gens parlent de nous au singulier, jamais au pluriel
Je sais qu'j'suis exposé, je suis qu't'es réservé
J'te mets dans des histoires qu'ta mère n'arrive pas à encaisser (Ilias!)
Tu vis à travers moi, oui je t'ai remplacé
Je suis le virus dans ton couple quand tu dors dans l'canapé
Je suis le pourquoi du comment quand t'as du mal à t'confesser
Le reflet du miroir que t'as du mal à casser, mais
Toi et moi on n'fait qu'un, je n'trouve plus d'mots
Laisse-moi te porter vers le haut car

Psychefunkapus,"I see the dawning of a new beginning
And it feels like I'm riding on the winds of change
Yes, I'm taking the lead, but I still ain't winning
Takin' all that I can before the light of day
I can see the world goin' on around me
I can smell the scent of magic in the air
I can hear all the voices behind me

I can make up my mind between heaven and hell
The priest and the doctor pray for my well-being
As they research and pray that I will see the light
But I realize it's themselves who they're freeing
When I step in the box or I lie on the couch
Makes no sense to me to start pretending 
That I'll ever find salvation through a man
Mine alone is the soul that I'm mending
And I won't let this world interfere with my plans

Please get me out of here!
Help me to get out of here!

Some cause pleasure, some cause pain
Riding high on waves of fear
Trying to lead me out of here
Trying to lead me out of here
Out of here!

Faith takes comfort of all my inhibitions
As the vapors of guilt escape through my pores
And now once again it's my conscious condition
That allows me the strength to break open the doors
I can see the world goin' on around me
I can smell the scent of magic in the air
I can hear the voices behind me
I can make up my mind between heaven and hell

I'm gonna catch the falling feathers from your wing

Tiny people crawling as I broke it on the floor
I put them in my pockets, took them where they can't be found

I see it coming all down
I see the future is red
I see the innocent are laying dead

They cover the dead where they're laying
Until the battle is won, the war has just begun
Burning like a hell, goddamn
It's just a different time and another kind of Vietnam
Burning fire, we are going to burn in the fire
We're gonna burn it high
Can you hear all the lies
That try to cover their cries
The hell is more real than the television can make it feel
Keep the war machine fed
Try cover your head
Just think of God as a gun
This is the freedom that you've won
The skyline is glowing
And the fire is growing

The freeze is coming on
Everyone is sleeping now
The first on to bed, but the last to leave my head
So I burn another number down
And as I'm laying down I'm wondering
Where are all the people now
Where is all the screaming crowd
And as I bring on what's inside of me
I know it's quite a dream
Burn the candles down
As we're pulling out of town
Pass the haze around
Talk about the show
Got another less to go
Hey,what did you think about the sound ?
Cold November's got me burning down
Cold November's got me ember burning down
Now my ears are ringing
I don't mind the sound
Concerned about my singing
Cause the cold can bring it down

Psychotic Waltz,"Where does the weather go when I see blue around the gold
Circling the atmosphere in California clear ?
Where does the time go when today turns into long ago ?
Where are all the colors when a rainbow disappear ?

Light the night to make it like the day, it really won't glow
It really won't
Make a line to make it mind the time, they really won't go
Where they ever ?
I stand surrounded here, imaginary interfere
Supersonic architecture Spanish castle cream
Press my hands against my ears to try to make the voices clear
An acrobatic, symphonic helicopter scream
All that shines will come in time
Never mind all that's left behind
Lovestone blind, well still is mine
Here I find my piece of mind
Now they look into the eyes of a silver screen can of lies
The city streets are the golden cage of the sleeping flies
Wings pounding to the concrete dance of stamping shoes
Gold seeping from the hand of the unamused
Down though the smoke to the trash scattered to the ground
Cut through the smell of the sirens screaming through the town
Kneeling down to the healing fix of a hypodermic crucifix
Hanging from the choking throats of giant stack of broken bricks

When the sun shines let your bullets fly like rain

When the rays of the killing sun won't shine
Blue as the wind, blew it all, blew it all the time
I see the sky burning red
Burning inside of you
So let it rain down hard
Let it break on through
I see your world, I see your seas
And I know what's going to be left
When you leave what you leave for me
You're pulling me down
Don't lay down when the sun shines

Waiting for the rain to pour into their overflowing hands
Waiting, waiting
This life is mine
I'm living in my time
You gave, you slaved
You thought that you'd be saved
Now you're waiting like the flies
To drag your tongue across my eyes
I claw into my hole all the ashes of my soul

Saturday was soaked
In passive stress
In madness

In darkness
On Sunday I realise
Only one day remain
Then I'm back
To Monday again

A week meant to annoy me
A week sent to destroy me

A week lived, a week less
A week built on weakness
Omnipresent pointlessness

A bleak weak is not unique
A bleak weak, not worth exploring
A bleak weak is worth ignoring
A week lame beyond boring

Anstatt über das Problem, mach ich den Scheiß hier halt nochmal
Weil sich nur was ändern wird, wenn's keine Nachfrage mehr gibt
Ich will das Kreuzberg meiner Eltern aus den Achtzigern zurück
In den Straßen, wo ihr heute Abend tanzen wollt auf Partydrogen
Wurden meine Freunde zwangsgeräumt und abgeschoben
Denn du darfst genauso solange bleiben wie du Geld hast
Und danach bist du kein anerkannter Teil dieser Gesellschaft
Räudige Methoden, in Briefen freundlich drohen
Inserieren und verkaufen, obwohl noch Leute drin wohnen
Das sind täuschend echte Häuserkämpfe, wenn auch ohne Krieg
Du erkennst Gangster am Profit, fick die Sell-Out-Politik
Sie kürzen Jugendclubs die Mittel, weil sie dafür nicht genug haben
Und versenken gleichzeitig Milliarden in einen Flughafen
Logisch, die Mission ist: noch mehr Yuppies in das Viertel rein
Platz für tausend Luxusbauten, nur nicht für ein Flüchtlingsheim

Denn euch gehören die Häuser, aber uns gehört die Stadt
Von Hamburg nach München, in den Pott und den Osten
Befreit eure Blocks von den Bonzen!

Ich bin der letzte, meine Freunde und Familie mussten wegziehen
Leute, die ich ewig kenn', verlieren ihre Existenzen
Die könnt ihr hier nicht ersetzen, wir bildeten Strukturen
Zwischen den Kulturen, unser Viertel liebt ihr doch nur deswegen
Man kann's jeden Tag sehen, hier wird Verständnis zum Fremdwort
In Szene-Cafes, wo man auf Englisch bestellen muss
Parallelgesellschaft wenn's um Gastarbeiter geht
Doch wenn die Hipster unter sich bleiben, ist das auf einmal ok?
Der Vorbesitzer wurde da per Räumungsklage rausgeholt
Die Stammkunden pöbeln und bekommen sofort Hausverbot
Meine neuen Nachbarn rufen permanent die Bullen
Wenns zu laut und asi ist, warum seid ihr hergezogen?
In den Arbeiterkiez, wo wenig Menschen Arbeit haben
Habt ihr doch kein Fuß gesetzt in den letzten zwanzig Jahren
Und mich kriegt ihr auch nicht weg, ich bleib bestimmt hier für immer
Ich bin Kreuzberger, meine Hand hat fünf Mittelfinger

Niemand, der was sagt, doch die blauen Augen sieht jeder
Ganz normale Dinge, hier in der Stadt der Sünde
Ein endlos tiefer freier Fall in menschliche Abgründe
Euer Gott heißt Geld, sein Prophet heißt Profit
Doch ein Bruder wird zum Judas, wenn er zuviel davon sieht
Ich hab's erlebt, ein Freund lügt dir ins Gesicht
Weil er langsam verjunkt oder spielsüchtig ist
Und ich wünsche mir von Herzen in die Klasse meiner Schwester 
Würden Kids mit einem Lächeln kommen, anstatt mit einem Messer
Wenn sie nie was anderes kannten, wissen manche es nicht besser
Aber, die die es geschehen lassen - das sind die Verbrecher
Zwischen all den Regeln und Verboten, die sie aufstellen
Hast du vielleicht keine Wahl und musst das Risiko in Kauf nehmen
Im großen Stil da draußen, kannst du Drogen dealen und Rauben
Doch wirst nie so Gangster sein wie die oberen Zehntausend

Doch ha'm sich direkt vor uns weggefixt und totgesoffen
Klar gibt's hier im Wesentlichen keine echten Elendsviertel
Trotzdem Kids, die Deo schnüffeln und so ihre Seele trösten
Silbergraue Regenbögen - von hier kommen keine Politiker
Auch keine von den Szenegrößen lebt hier wirklich
All das, was du hier nicht kennst aus deinem Dorf
Mauerblümchen stranden hier und verwelken auch sofort
Diese Stadt hat kein Meer - hier musst du U-Bahn surfen
Ich wollte nie dazu gehören
Guck, in meiner Stadt gehen die Parties manchmal zweiundsiebzig Stunden
Aber keiner hat für Reue oder Zweifel Zeit gefunden
Niemand glaubt hier an was gutes, denn wir kamen von ganz unten
Und wissen wie schwer es ist, ohne 'ne Waage zu benutzen

Gewalt ist keine Lösung sondern eine Reaktion
Immer wenn er weiter wächst, daran erblinden viele Menschen

Oder mich dazu bringen brav zu funktionieren
Ist nicht so mein Ding bei bestimmten Sachen einzulenken

Ich seh's an dir, weswegen es so gut funktioniert
Du pilgerst in die Konsumtempel, betest zu buntem Papier
Vergiss deine Ideen und gib am Besten dein Talent auf

Aber Geld ist sowieso nicht der Lohn für meine Zeit
Ich mach Workshops mit Kids, die erinnern mich an mich
Du kannst es besser wissen, nur ein Kind kann es noch nicht
Und genau das macht mich reich, denn ein Batzen voll mit Scheinen
Ist auch niemals so viel wert wie das Lachen von den Kleinen
Und klar, Digga, ich weiß, dass ich selber nicht perfekt bin
Du verstehst was falsch, ich will die Welt auch gar nicht retten
Soll sie brennen und verrecken, wie gesagt
Jeden Tag verliert sie an Wert für mich

Ich versteh' die Welt nicht, sie versteht mich auch nicht
Und wozu soll ich drüber reden wenn sie taub ist
Nein, ich versteh' die Welt nicht, sie versteht mich auch nicht

Manchmal lauf ich durch die Straßen so als ob ich etwas suche
Und weiß wenn ich es mal habe, dass es trotzdem nicht genug ist
Und so komm ich nie zur Ruhe und ich schlaf' seit Jahren schlecht
Weil ich irgendwas vermisse, was die Stadt vor mir versteckt

Ich bin auf Kriegsfuß mit mei'm Karma

Die Natur ist schlauer und sie weiß wie's geht
Denn der Samen kann erst fruchten wenn man reif genug ist
Bei uns funktioniert es leider so nicht
Der wichtigste Job hat keinen Einstellungstest
Man braucht für ein Kind nur Sex
Keine Ausbildung, keine Vorraussetzung
Keiner, der kontrolliert wie's aufwächst und
Ob's überhaupt 'n Cent sieht von seinem scheiß Kindergeld

Wie viele Kinder werden ruhig gestellt mit Fernsehen und Zucker?
Warum bringt keiner 'ne werdende Mutter in Lehrgänge unter?
Und wieso denkst du es macht dich zum Mann 'ne Schlampe zu ficken?
Aber bist dann nicht Mann genug und lässt 'ne Schwangere sitzen
Und dein eigenes Fleisch, wie kann man so feige sein?
Dass du nicht mal weißt wie es heißt
Und wie fühlt sich das an mit aller Kraft zu gebären
Um sein Kind dann in eine Babyklappe zu legen?
Wie viel Kinder holen sie noch aus verwahrlosten Wohnungen?
Wie viel Babies lagen schon tot im Müll
'Ne ganze Generation, die's nicht schafft zu lieben
Und die Hälfte der nächsten hat sie abgetrieben

Mann wie sauer es mich macht, dass man nicht teilt wenn man's kann
Und sich die Köpfe einschlägt in diesem scheiß reichen Land
Gebt uns immer mehr Gesetze und dann brechen wir die auch
Ihr habt den Brandsatz gelegt, wir sprechen ihn nur aus

Ob die Rechnungen sich stapeln wie die Sorgen in deinem Kopf
Die Päckchen, die wir tragen und welche Chance du bekommst
Im Endeffekt hängt das alles nur vom Geld ab
Schöne Grüße vom Rande der Gesellschaft
Wirst du nie belangt oder werfen sie dich in Knast
Was die Leute in dir sehen und welchen Wert du für sie hast
Im Endeffekt hängt das alles nur vom Geld ab
Schöne Grüße vom Rande der Gesellschaft

Von zwischen den Milieus
Die Hälfte von den Taten, die sie nächtlich taten
Werden in meinem Viertel nicht gelöst
Von denen, die nervös mit 'nem Mietwagen mal rüberfahren
Von den Trick- und Kreditkartenbetrügern 
Von denen, die jeden Morgen vor dem Arbeitsamt stehen
Von denen, die Leistung beziehen und dann schwarz Ackern gehen
Von denen, die verzweifeln und keinen Aufenthalt bekommen
Und an der Ecke stehen mit 'ner Bauchtasche voll Drogen
Von denen, die mit Bewährung gegen Auflagen verstoßen
Die euch auf der Straße drohen mit lautstarken Parolen
Von den Risiko bereiten für 'ne Potte voll von Geld
Von den Sitzenbleibern, von den hoffnungslosen Fällen

PTK,"„Ihr Problem ist, dass Sie ihr ganzes Leben lang dachten, es gäbe Regeln
Es gibt keine
Früher waren wir Gorillas
Wir hatten nur das, was wir verteidigten oder uns nahmen 
Es ist ein giftiger Fluss, das Leben, das wir führen
Die Scheiße, die sie uns fressen lassen
Tag für Tag
Sie wissen schon wie sie uns zermürben
Wenn Sie sich nicht dagegen wehren 
In sich zeigen, dass Sie noch wild sind
Tief im Inneren wo's drauf ankommt
Dann werden Sie einfach mitgerissen“

Nachts in 61 auf der Straße wie die Füchse
Kapuze in der Fresse, Farbe in der Büchse
Parolen an die Wand, Pascha, Patronen in die Pumpgun
Das kommt später, gegen die da oben kämpft man anders
Dominoeffekt, ich bring Niveau in deutschen Rap
Rekrutiere Bodentruppen, jetzt die Revolution wächst
Es geht um Prozess, jeder Block ein Wespennest
Keine Chance, denn wir wachsen dort auf wo sonst nix wächst
Gefahrengebiete nennen sie die Straßen, die wir lieben
Ab und zu kommen sie hier her wie auf Safari um zu schießen
Und die meisten laufen eh schon rum wie ausgestopft und prepariert
Ausgenommen von diesem Rapper hier
Sie haben ihre Ameisen für jede Form von Staatsfeinden
Doch auch jeder Bulle muss mal irgendwann ins Gras beißen
Tag ein und aus seid ihr unwillkommen im 36
Müsste nicht so sein, aber ihr hört ja nicht

Ja, wir leben hier wie Tiere
Und ihr könnt alles probieren
Doch ich lass mich nicht dressieren, nein
Du würdest durchdrehen nach 'ner Stunde meines Lebens
Ich springe auf dei'm Autodach rum wie eine Krähe
Ja, wir leben hier wie Tiere
Und ihr könnt alles probieren
Doch ich lass mich nicht dressieren, nein
Du würdest durchdrehen nach 'ner Stunde meines Lebens
Ich springe auf dei'm Autodach rum wie eine Krähe

Ein Löwe brüllt und wird nicht still
Ich glaub ich bin der einzige, der wirklich was bewirken will
Ich guck nicht zu während mein Viertel stirbt (Anti Turista)
Jedes Lied, dass ich mach ein Drohbrief an die Minister
Digger, die die es verdient ha'm stell ich alle an den Pranger
Den Senat, seine Handlanger
Geh auf Jagd so wie ein Panter 
Und reiß Beute, teil' mit Leuten, die vom selben Schlag sind
Glaub mir, ich weiß genau wie selten diese Art ist
Es ist kein ?, dass du denkst du bist alleine
Aber du bist nicht der einzige solang ich PTK bin
Da es gut tut nicht allein zu kämpfen und für Chaos zu sorgen
Wie ein Bluttropfen im Haifischbecken
Ein Raubtier in Gefangenschaft wartet auf die Gelegenheit
Macht der Pfleger einen Fehler wird er zu 'nem Pflegefall
Es rächt sich für die letzten paar Jahre Schmerz
Und selbst wenn es das letzte ist, war es das wert

Denn wir leben hier wie Tiere
Und ihr könnt alles probieren
Doch ich lass mich nicht dressieren, nein
Du würdest durchdrehen nach 'ner Stunde meines Lebens
Ich springe auf dei'm Autodach rum wie eine Krähe
Denn wir leben hier wie Tiere
Und ihr könnt alles probieren
Doch ich lass mich nicht dressieren, nein
Du würdest durchdrehen nach 'ner Stunde meines Lebens
Ich springe auf dei'm Autodach rum wie eine Krähe

And the only thing we came there to do and that's to slow dance

How come we don't slow dance no more
How come we don't hold each other real close
Stick together close like hand and glove
The way we used to do off, honey love

The basement parties used to be so tight
Bumpin', grindin', freakin' with you all night
Off up in the corner shorty got me goin'
Pressed all up against me shorty got me swoll

H-Town had everybody knockin' boots
Are Kelly, PA honey lovin' you
Freak me, baby, lights out like Silk used to do
Do me, baby, in the corner, just me and you

Isley Brothers put us in the bed between the sheets
For some sexual healin', for some sexual healin'
Keith Sweat talking' bout how deep your loving go
Luther Vandross put us in the mood for some, ooh yeah

How come we don't slow dance no more
How come we don't hold each other real close
Stick together close like hand and glove
The way we used to do off, honey love

The basement parties used to be so tight
Bumpin', grindin', freakin' with you all night
Off up in the corner shorty got me goin'
Pressed all up against me shorty got me swoll

How come we don't slow dance no more
How come we don't hold each other real close

Public Announcement,"You know, we have this old saying
You won't miss your water, until your well runs dry
And some of us may not know what that means
But what that means is
When your first love leaves you
You might be walking through the park, or maybe at the movies
And just happen to see that person with someone else
And all those old feelings just come back

The first time that I saw you 
I remember how in love I was with you
Then things started, slowly to change 
I miss your body, will I ever hold you again 
Cause you told me that you needed 
Me for you that's why I made sacrifices 
All this time invested what compares to what we do 
When I see you with him you're walking on what we knew

1 - When I see you in his arms
I wish his arms were mine
When I see you kissing him
I wish his lips were mine
When I see you holding him
I wish his body was mine
I can't stand being without you girl

I gave you my heart girl from the beginning 
And I never stopped loving you when you said let's be friends
I thought it was over, my feelings for you
Until the day when I saw both of you
My heart dropped as I approached you
And when I shook his hand girl I felt you
And when I looked you straight girl, straight in your eyes 
I felt you crying as I said bye-bye, bye baby

Repeat 1

In my life, oh
Yeah baby, oh yeah, heh
All those lonely nights, I spent without you 
I still see the images of me and you
When we were making love day and night
I never be without you by my side
Oh baby can't you see 
That we were meant to be 
Together forever baby just you and me 
And I don't think that I can get you out of my mind
Cause I'll be waiting for you till the end of time 

Repeat 1 till end

        She don't want a brother that's true and black

        She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
        Her status looks at us from down below
        Now the bitch is in trouble

        Cause she was so-
        phisticated

        Little is known about her past
        So listen to me cause I know her ass
        Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
        And never got caught, so the story goes
        She kept doin' that to all her men
        Found the wrong man when she did it again
        And still to this day people wonder why

Just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold 
Knowin' for a fact that girl is whacked 
If you hold your hand out she'll turn her back

Can't be her friend unless you spend 
Wall to wall after all 
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch 

Cause she thinks she's so

Peekin', seekin' inside a book 
Her demands for a man with a chemical look 
Wishes, desires, gettin' worse with age 
She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page 
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club 
She think it's classy but it's really a pub 
But that's the kind of place she likes to go 
The bitch got a problem 

Cause she thinks she's so- 
Phisticated 

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties 
The girl only wants one of those guys 
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing 
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang 
Talk like this, don't talk slang 
Do anything to get that thang 
Tries to be chic and play it off 
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off 
Nasty girl, stone cold freak 
Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week 
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms 
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms 
Never kept a name, never seen a face 
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place 
I know she's a ho I'm on the go 
Expose the funky bitch 

Cause she thinks she's so-

Now she wants a sucker but with an attache 
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away

Public Enemy,"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone",Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos
Public Enemy,"Caught, now in court 'cause I stole a beat
This is a sampling sport
But I'm giving it a new name
What you hear is mine
P.E. you know the time
Now, what in the heaven does a jury know about hell
If I took it, but but they just look at me
Like, hey I'm on a mission
I'm talkin' 'bout conditions
Ain't right sittin' like dynamite
Gonna blow you up and it just might
Blow up the bench and

This court is dismissed when I grab the mike

Can I get a witness?

C'mon get wit' it

Made me mad when I was on tour
That I declared war on black radio
They say that I planned this

Won't be on a play list
Bust the way that I say this: No Sell Out

I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal

Now they listen and they want my head

Instead of peace the police
Just want to wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigger
And started to search
An so I headed west
Went to Cali to rally
Was for a brothers death
It was the fuzz who shot him

It takes a man to take a stand
Understand it takes a
Woman to make a stronger man
(As we both get strong)
They'll call me a crazy Asiatic
While I'm singin' a song
Oh my god, oh my lord

I can't hold back
But I get exact on a track
It's an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Forget about me
Just set my sister free
R-e-s-p-e-c-t my sisters, not my enemy
(Cause we'll be stronger together)
And make the suckers say
(Damn) this generation

They don't know what we got goin' is (sound)
To turn it all around
To my sisters I communicate
With the bass and tone
through speakers and the microphone
Cause I'm tired of America dissin' my sisters
(For example, like they dissed Tawana)
And they try to say she's a liar
My people don't believe it
But even now they're getting higher
Of the feeling inspiration
We must know that in this nation
Every single generation
(They teach us how to dis our sisters)
strange as you say, I say revolution
Need for change brings on revolution
The great book just look see solution

God chooses who and what for the bruisin'
There's been no justice for none
Of my sisters
Just us been the ones that's been missin' her
Now we got to protect
We get together and damn this generation

I said so to what it is
Where it is
She needs a lil' respect
There it is
I say she needs a lotta
Brother from a mother like me has gotta
Give it up
Give it now
And pass it all around
To my soul (sister)

They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
America took her, reshaped her, raped her
Nope, it never made the paper
Beat us, mated us
Made us attack our woman in black
So I said sophisticated B, don't be one
Not to head the warning crack of dawn
Or is it the dawn of crack?
Stop the talk they say, but
We talk and say what's right or wrong
Some say we wasting time singin' a song
But why is it that we're many different shades
Black woman's privacy invaded years and years
You cannot count my mama's tears
It's not the past but the future's
What she fears
Strong we be strong
The next generation
It's what not who we are facin'
The fingers pointed to us in our direction
The blind state of mind needs correction
Word to the mother we tighten connection
To be a man you need no election
This generation generates a new attitude
Sister to you we should not be rude
So we come together
And make 'em all say
Damn this generation",Revolutionary Generation
Public Enemy,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Public Enemy,"Once again, this is it
Turn it up
Here we go
But this time the rhyme
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
Like I want to know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
Afth, he rocket it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinna thing they threw at James
An what did to Redd was a shame
The the Black get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that booty
Intentional rape system, like we ain't
Payed enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned so where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho
Who stole the soul?

Ain't, no, different
Than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo they say the Black don't know how to act
'Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black move it, Jack move out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good for a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
'Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
They I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
And try to be the best and 
Let everybody know before I blow
For the sake of what's right
I want to know who stole the soul?

We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented bye those who never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But that's all right
I try do what a brother does
But I'll never know if you're my 'cause
That's why I try my best to unite
And damn the rest if they don't like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
Forty acres and a mule Jack

It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue
Sucker that stole the soul!",Who Stole the Soul?
Public Enemy,"I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sack and jack
Then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like me go solo
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya

As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid

Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked

Never question what I am God knows

Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone

Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
He give the liquor man ten to begin
Wit' no change and he run
To get his brains rearranged

To do without a table
Beside what's inside ain't on the label
They drink it thinkin' it's good
But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
They're slaves to the liquor man

He can drink it down
And think nothin' about it
Pass it around and get tha forty dog buzz

Shorty can't remember what day it was

Plan that's designed by the other man

One and on till the stores reorder it
Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
Sippin' it lick drink it down oh no
Drinkin' poison but they don't know

Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
'Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do""

That the critics are blasting me for

They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B, and L.L. as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell

The treble was level, I like it like that
I was rolly-roll-a-roll rollin'

And I stopped still, I never got ill
'Cause my license was clean an I showed
A peace powwow, instead of pow pow
I'm straight up and I'm straight, so how you like me now

Which tape should I rock, L.L.'s or R.A.'s?
I'm in the streets of New York, go away
I pop in my cool G Rap 'n' Polo tape

And they was at it again, sirens in the air
Ah sh**, so I'm outta here
But the blue in the front called the blue in the back
They cut me off and stopped me dead in my tracks

But this is minimal, I'm not a criminal
I always did what I did because I'm not a kid
And I looked around, they stared me down
Told me what I did, I ain't wit' it

'Cause word around town was a stickup
Yeah, yeah, yeah, be-boy n**** in a pickup
But I was jeepin' and creepin', just a keepin'
It down sound, here we go the run around

I'm blamin' me for the hardcore roar
But they the ones wit' the 44's

Public Enemy,"[Flav] Yo Chuck where you at G??
       I think he went upstairs why'know
[DJ] A very furious mixture of noise
     What Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee calls
     music's worst nightmare

""Hey, he's a good kid""

[Chuck D] Air Hoodlum (repeat 2X)
[Tony D] Check check, check the elevation (repeat 4X)

""A player, that can leap, with the best of them""

Risin up in the 'Velt, Strong Island, New York
The hood in case you did not know my base
There was a ballplayer who had all the skills
Wit the pill to pay the piper, plus all the bills
Mick his first name, Mack the awesome game
Practiced in the heat, in the rain or in pain
Mick so quick, at six foot six
Down to be picked by anyone but the Celtics
Oh what a handle could score from the floor
With people bangin on him, or even hangin on him
But what he did best, above all the rest was...

""A player that can leap, with the best of them""
""As a high school standout...""
""The skywalker himself!""
""I felt, he could do, to make this an effective basketball team""

Grades nine and ten, Mickey Mack was all that
But in class his ass sat way in the back
How I know, cause I know, I used to flow wit the bro
He didn't mind I used to read him his own headline
Cause he could not read em his school wouldn't need em
If the lines wouldn'ta went like this
Mickey Mack jumped over the candlestick
His stack was his stats but his D was still wack
Grades eleven and twelve he found the wrong clientele and all
During class, he would dribble in the hall
But never got in trouble in school, but the trouble was
It was cool if your brain was just another bubble
As long as he could score fiddy-two
Get thirty-three rebounds, fuckin around
Temas lost to him he went right through em
Division, county, state, that's three count em
Championships for a small town bro
That's bound to go pro

""He gets free, turn on the jumper, good!""
""Streak of lightning when he breaks loose...""
""We all felt in our hearts we could win this ballgame""
""They just required me to have the game that I did
 I'm just... that's all I that's all I that's all I can say""
""That's all I can say""
""He hauled down fifteeen rebounds, and kept the ball away from everybody""
""Then he had a triple double!""
""A-a-a sensational player...""

SAT's didn't matter cause he was all that
You know the pat on the back
He was always in the news you gotta know what it means
It means revenue, and I'm tellin you
I saw cars and G's come to our school please
Approach Hell with the principal, where's the coach
Went to college four years wit a scholarship...
...and won the championship
But when it came to his life he didn't care...
...cause he took it to the air

""Cross and a hook, he scores, he's fouled!""
""From the far corner, breaks West and here's the jumper, good!!""
""There's the jumper, it's not gonna go, rebound batted back...""

[Chuck D] Air

The fall began when Mickey Mack fell
Hell ripped his kneee drafted last by personnel
Oh how he loved the game, it was fantastic
Until he was cut, and couldn't stick
Times got tighter and tighter
He had an attitude was rude, so he turned into a fighter
School wouldn't give him the job that he needed
Assistant to the assistant coach, they didn't need it
Then he resorted to a stick up kid
Ski-mask and gat, but this game he wasn't good at
And the drugs on the side
Police ambushed his ride another homicide
He was over, ghost why'know
Hometown hero, but now a zero
To those hypocrites who ripped him blind
For his skills without the will to develop his mind
Forever in the news the community views him
Only as Air Hoodlum

In a ocean of sharks

They say I'm fallin' off
Yeah, they better call it off
and get muscle

Sick 'n' tired of critics

But they don't know it
They can blow it

Remember what I said
Who killed a critic
Guess the crew did it

Say paybacks a crazy ass message
Sent to the writers who criticize
They're fuckin' with afreedom fighter

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Public Enemy,"Hey yo, Chuck, yo the world if sleepin', G
We got to wake everybody up yo
Hey yo, it's goin' down, baby
Let everybody know how it's goin' down, baby

The way this goes down is simple, from this day forth
Anything to deal with rap, stay off
It's just the players, no pay offs, strictly skills (uh)
If you're brain's the same you'll stick to your deals
And this field ain't about sellin' a mil'
With the run of the mill, so just be tellin' the real
It ain't like a third time fella's appeal
'Til the GOD scolds him and tells him to deal
I'll allow you to write, maybe allow you to bite
If you're down to fight the power here's the power to fight
Overpower the mic, hit the crowd with the bomb diggy
Ring the alarm, now the squads with me
From way back I show now weakness when I speak this
Mentally strong to keep this hit in my speeches given
Now listen from the beginnin' 'til I reach the endin'
My short stories winnin' and keep the beats spinnin'

[Chorus]
You know the name, P.E.!
You know the game, P.E.!
We ain't for the game
We for the change
I wake up everyday with my game face on
You know the name, P.E.!
You know the name, P.E.! 
Yeah we ain't  for the fame
We for the change
I wake up everyday with my game face on

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Break harder than ever, follow my lead
Through the fast lane in the game, they follow my speed
Either ease off the gas or floor it
You ain't ready to get it, I dunno why they keep askin' for it
This the real P.E., ain't no castin' for it
Cop lights, news camera, no action for it
Get the uncut raw, we somewhat sure
Hip hop's like a chess game, discussin' the war
Strategize, move like masterminds
When it's your go and your do', just cash mine
Last time we welcomed y'all to the Terrordome
Used the mic to reach out and touch, instead of the phone
I appear from the rear, stayin' from clear
Nobody can say if I'm here so they play it by ear
But here's the way I lay the idea
From this point on, the rest of '98, put it in high gear

[Chorus]

I saw it comin', premeditated world domination hesitated
Rough this nuclear war head, detonate it
I'm forbidden, so I stay hittin' up forgiven
For givin' the livin' the truth, 360 proof
So world look before this world's took
I curl books under my arm
Smoke charm and learn about this world's ?
Revelation the world cooks
I spit gold versus the pearl hooks
The first album made the world crooks
Got 'em snatchin', robbin', thievin', stealin' ideas
Believe in pleadin' reason for treason, conceal it for years
My criminal ? attract an accomplice to grub something
Results drastic measures
And the death of joy, the death of casket treasure
From the abyss, the greatest trick I played on the world
Was leadin' them to believe my mother's clit didn't exist
Then I extended the list
Revolutioned every flag raised by a clenchin' fist

[Chuck D]
Can the black hear his stepchild, run the mile
Forever like a juvenile, to stay alive
Survivin' in the freestyle, yo hold it down
Walkin' on the wild side, to live or die
Damn another slow song
Yo Money put the record back the FUCK on
No respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens
Pourin' fire on the gasoline, defeat fiends
Feelin' like fever, I'm gettin' warm
Chalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone
Lost and forgotten, minds rotten
The arcade shot em, Channel Zero on the TV got em
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
If you don't know yourself, then you nobody
Do your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang
I never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang
Silence in the face of violent crews
My rhymes and news be blacker than most blues
Troublin, it all come tumblin', for the strugglin'
Occupations, daily operations stimulations
Causin' mental violations, minds on vacation
In the middle of Revelation is a nation

Now here's the pop, turnaround jumper,
Hits the rim bounce away, the new slave trade.
Manchild, six feet five, but juvenile.
Thin line between getting bucks and gettin' wild.
Brooklyn style, hundred thousand miles.
Parquet tiles, leavin' ankles broke in a pile.
Son got a ticket to fly, he can make it if he try,
To the sky, like a Coney Island ride.
Gettin' pages, from his super agent, 
Community raises at the clout or the cages.
No doubt, center stages, mad phases,
From behind crazies flippin' through the faces.
Paper chases, love that many places.
Pros and cons, flics between the races.
He hold the rock, call for sweat shops.
Guard the set shop replaced by sex shops.
The highest bidder, no room for the quitter.
Gave seven tickets, under counterfeitas.
Three cities a week, droppin' needles.
Like the black Beatles take heed, what you need is 

[Chorus]
Jesus (The incredible)
Jesus (And in your existence, huh)
Jesus(The incredible, yea)
Jesus(Check it out)

Crack my picture, never switch up.
Smack the back ups, pack them pick ups.
Resurrection of the two man vocal section.
The spirit in your dark ass direction.
Duckin' them spray ups on my way that I thought be lay ups.
Won the battle wars, a thousand one push ups.
Here marks the return of them rules about Ruff Ryders.
Risin', chargin' hard from the point guard.
Watch what you prey for, but know the team that you play for.
Need I say more?
Uh, scared of the resurrection,
Sacrifice yours, them maybe the revolution is basketball.
Changes, generanges. 
Which means rearrange shit,
Erase shit, stuck on Playstations. 
Then the new plantations, I said a millions heads.
Waitin' for another nation.
To make your world be free.
No shoppin' sprees, there ain't no stoppin' me.
Here's the fee, not the weed. 
Got to see, God speed. What you need is 

[Chorus: x2]

Sticky D gives you fits, on them turnaround Hippocrates.
Comin' and goin' like flics.
Hit em net scripts, like a butcher.
Gettin' all the chips musta been a road trip against the Knicks.
On T.V. showcasin' kicks. 
Must be the fan 'cause his video gettin' all the chicks.
Walk up on a replay on Monday.

In the car parked way down the block with binoculars 
That's what they got.
Helicopters parked out on the roof
Ten thousand disposable cameras taking pictures for proof

Take your worth out ya ass in the stall y'all

Wipe you off your teeth like cavity creep.

If you got somethin', then they got you for somethin'

Lock em up in jail until he's past thirty
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't give a fuck about me
I'm past thirty three
Word is born, born is my word
I got you before my word fails
Fuck whatcha heard
I keep it real, you never catch me fakin'
When it comes down to money that's what I'm making
Don't try and take my shit yo, I know Lex yo
I'll have a fit yo
I'll turn the whole motherfuckin' block on you yo
And that leaves you with nowhere to go
Secretly by the police you was hired
You my favorite customer I didn't know you was wired
A nik on the ground, covered by my feet

Another brother fried in Texas
Spent my best pay days hittin' off exec's
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Analysis of the situations
Bringing forth alarming revelations
Cigars a hundred thousand dollar cars, what
Most of us do the laundry in the bus

Is we blessed 'cause fast foods processed
Will the last be first can the first be less?
Got no leverage
Mad thirst for the beverages

Now the funk got us dead 'n' drunk
Got your drink on but got no think on
Now you got beef, wanna knock out teeth
Against the land of the lost, gettin' tosses

6 daze a week of course to the bosses
Old timers preachin' as born again rhymers
In the school gotta walk men
Graduates can't talk, man

Lyin' between the chalk man
shakin' that money maker
That MTV honey is a faker
Let Ill and Al take her

Deaded borders separated by the waters
Stats and surveys be off like Saturdays
Madd killers reproducin' like caterpillars
What's on your mind on the welfare line?

Cuttin' Medicaid got us droppin' like flies
Words from the wise comin' from the dead
Not alive from Facundo Ariel López Trejo",Last Mass of the Caballeros
Public Enemy,"Told ya buffalo soldier 
Fell to the ground like Folgers
Couldn't hold the boulder
Fancy dancer paralyzed for an answer
In the hip hop game but the rap got cancer
Tumors poppin' from the middle of rumors
Generation x be the end of baby boomers
Is the next generation headed for doom
Control the soul and you got a got a
Truck fulla fertilizer blowin up the spot
Think it's terrorism the border line's hot
Check the passports tap the telephone
Surprise they home grown
And one of your fuckin' own
It's dat same ol' shit, dat same ol' game
From that same ol' gang up to that same ol' thing
Now what I see say you know me
I pour a metaphor of lsd

I don't know what y'all thinkin' about
But if you know like I know 
You better strap on your seatbelt 
Cause you in for a long ride

Now I be damn I been a man
Figure I never call myself a nigger
To get Benjamins
What's love got to do with what you got
Not a whole lot no forgot oh this shit is hot
Spendin' all the cheddar for clothes
With a sign foreclosed on the front mud
Lost in dominoes
 
Now the heads tell tales 
How the dead bled and fled
Now they livin' up in the bed 
Instead they seize us like Jesus
Married to the mob did a sloppy job in hempstead 
Lord had mercy want to curse me 
New world order got my ass drownin' in the water
Now what you stuck to the west 
That funk to the east is phat
ATL be krunk dirty south
Thirty thou crankin trunks
Try to pass the test but to the rest they flunk
Now what be indebted
Better get over it
Those times and raps ain't never comin' back
No future without a pass I kick ass
Rock the socks offa pandora's box
Is itany wonder why the clocks flavor got 
Between rehearsin a verse my jaw lox
I set the bomb between the are and B scene
Go against the grain run up on the train
And so I parallel the brains of cobain
As hip hop brain made em spill the champagne
Make it plain the sound remains insane
Come the same no holes closin up the lane
Don't ask no questions on the simple level
Can the magic get shaq back
Knicks get van exel
Bold rap lyrics fuck whatcha heard
Not no lost and found nouns or half ass words
Turnaround funk power moves ruffs
I ain't never been cuckoo for no coco puffs
LSD, set it free make em see the tricks
Rather try at 37 than die at 26

Lawyers no loyalties accountants no royalties
Lie for a lie I look em in the eye
History speaking lawyers should die
Kissed the companies and made them all cry
A new rap song and a real drive by
Why o why did the video die
The narcs and the feds got the pimp niggas 'fraid
Threat of the aids got the bitches afraid
The god damn white man got you afraid
Social service got your mama afraid
Scared of the fact before a niggas black
Some of you say nigga before you say crack
You got no back is what you lack

Compensation we ain't seein'
Split by Europeans
Damn treated less than human beings
No matter
Africa, Brazil, East St. Louis or the Caribbean
Traveled the seven seas
Rocked many races
Spread the cash cleaned trash
In a lotta low places

Seen the look of love on many mad faces
When I rhymed about the time
And not the paper chases
People all over the world given mad respect
When I identified who the Government wrecked
What's the SoundScan
Ask the company rep
They don't care
They just about keepin' their checks

Round and round and round we go
Where the worlds headed nobody knows

Hear the crime rhyme created a lotta robots
Can the real lyric fix the shit that the time forgot
Loops gotcha brain gettin' locked
Loaded up with words that never meant a lot
And you can't call the cops
And y'all don't really know
And y'all don't hear me through
Takes a nation of big brains
To break up that flow
And the game ain't changed
But the heads be rearranged
In danger
My language is rappin' in anger
I be bangin' so I point my finger
While we sleep
Racists set us up like sheep
Every time I go someplace
Slaves up in my face

No control of soul
Wouldn't know our fate

        From the lower level
        I'm takin' tabs
        Sho nuff stuff to grab
        Like shirts it hurts
        Wit a neck to wreck
        Took a poll 'cause our soul
        Took a toll
        From the education
        Of a TV station

        I'm addin' woes
        That's how da way it goes
        Then you think I rank never drank, point blank
        I own loans

        Civil liberty I can't see to pay a fee
        I never saw a way to pay a sap

        No no

        Suckers gonna pay
        Anyway

        They don't want it to be

Death row what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal

Five-O said ""Freeze!"" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do""
Follow for now, power to the people say,
""Make a miracle. D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric be, and L.L. as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue

Kill the innocent?
Between terrorists 
And CIA hit lists

Beware the false prophets
Gotta be smarter than this
They say war is a profit
With loved ones missed
But death is a debt
None of us ain't seen war yet

May war have no sequel, live

A hundred times worse than Vietnam

Platinum gold a house and a car

Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living
But the Man from the east calls it a wilderness
Cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in america
Heaven and hell are two conditions of Life
Not a place up there or a place down there
It's a condition of life on earth so value Life
Heaven is not things
It's a higher level of thinking
And at the moment one may change the conditions of Life
Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and moet,
Krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven
Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time
But being able to meet Life's struggles head on, head on, head on
Without compromising your Soul soul soul soul
In this worlds Life
Not Life after death
Life on earth
Life
Not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
Sit yourself in heaven at once
A woman is a very important part of heaven
She produces heaven with you
And if she is connected to the source of Life
So heaven is a condition of Life
And you can have it on earth
SO VALUE LIFE
VALUE LIFE

I can't do nothin' for you man

Go lean on shells answer man
I can't do nothin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

Make ya love the wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Oozy down the bullets in the gun

Just microwave themselves a ton

Public Enemy,"Well I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1-2-3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap - 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use - I never lose to a team
'Cause I can can go solo, like a Sugar Ray bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut some cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassin' cause I'll start placin'
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and you mind from a beatin' from my rhymes
A time, a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

You got no rap, but you want a battle
It's like havin' a boat, but you got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sittin', all fittin' not bitten
Givin' me the juice that your not gettin'
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer
A word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught a, for going out of order
And now you're servin' football teams their water
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun, being on the run
'Cause they got me, Public Enemy number one

For all you suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
You crossed up wires are always starting fires
For you grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, I heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell ya equipment, but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew, is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic lyrical son

Public Enemy,"You're blind, baby
You're blind from the facts on who you are
'cause you're watchin' that garbage

The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman
She might make you forget yours
There's a 5 letter word
To describe her character
But her brains being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes
He gets dissed like a roach

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch 
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, you got to cut that garbage off
Yo! I want to watch the game
{Where's your doin'} 
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in: I'm
'a take all your soaps
An' then I'm gonna hang 'em on a rope
You know what I'm sayin'? 
'Cause that garbage your watchin' don't make no sense
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in baby
I'm 'a take your set an' I'm 'a throw it
Out the window
G's

Two, seven, five, four, eight
She watched she said
All added up to zero
And nothing in her head
She turns and turns
And she hopes the soaps
Are for real, she learns
That it ain't true, nope
But she won't survive
And rather die in a lie
Falls a fool, for some dude, on a tube

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch

Do it look like I'm jokin'? 
I ain't jokin', word up, baby
Yo, cut that garbage off now
Yo, I got the Tyson fight on, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Yo, so you can't be comin' in here stackin' {aid} like that
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Yo, we gettin' ready to watch the Super Bowl
We got a black quarterback so step back

Trouble vision for a sister
'Cause I know she don't know, I quote
Her brains retrained
By a 24 inch remote
Revolution a solution
For all of our children
But her children
Don't mean as much as the show, I mean
Watch her worship the screen, and fiend
For a TV ad
And it just makes me mad

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

Yo baby, can't you that's nonsense you watchin'? 
Look, don't nobody look like that
Nobody even live that, you know what I'm sayin'? 
You watchin' garbage, not'in' but garbage

Public Enemy,"Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower
When we are together we got power
That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own

We spit flows on foes 
Listen to the message that you never know 
Got a plan for the man and it's federal 
The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
Clear the madness, and put the message in 
D, the enemy is back to rip the mic 
We come together, so don't believe the hype 
Check my tone, there's a war here at home 
We united and strong, and never move alone 

We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
Put fam first, man, woman and child 
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise 
Where we say, what we mean and we mean what we say 
It's been a long time comin' that we mob as one 
Guerrilla funk, hard truth nigga, that's what's up 
No peace on the street 'til the justice come 
From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
See, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Believe, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me

They gon' have to pop me to stop me

Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof
My buildin' got an 'x' on it 
Bloomberg threw the hex on it
It's like a pistol with effects on it 
On a nigga with arrest warrants 
Hittin' pigs in their chests quadrant where they vest wasn't 
Now he dead cousin 
All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some uncle-tom killers 
Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla 

Yo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees 
I ain't got no 'g' to give it to them crackers and court fees 
You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst 
Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert 
Malcolm x said send them to the cemetery if they touch you 
A revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you 
I'm up early workin' my machete 
In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me

My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
You see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha

Yeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap
You really think you gon' be left alone 
On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on? 
Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route 
While I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out 
I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them 
I'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom ""that's right""
comin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it ""right""
So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted 
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk ""that's right""
This ain't the word of a fake, it's guerrilla funk 
So right now is the time and you turf the location 
Y'all about to see the rebirth of a nation 
Even if some got de-rebelized 
The revolution still will not be televised 
you.s. government tellin' hell of lies 
And it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Yeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
No homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me

That's real talk on the one 

That is why, I challenged you now
To stand together, raise your fists together
And engage in our national black messiness
Do it courage and determination

Public Enemy,"I came from a place I forgot
I woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot
On the corner where all the streets got the same name
Maybe my brain's on the brink of (insane!)
Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train
This the land of milk and honey (know what I'm sayin'?!)
The invisible man times three
Black, down and out, out standin' on a corner (no doubt)
Now a nation of homeless sleepin' in bus stations
Another win for the pilgrims who said (no more Haitians)
As I proceed, someone to feed me is what I need
(Three blocks of dealers tryin' to hit me off with some weed)
Yeah, avenues and boulevards hungry as a (fucker)
Hope to get a ride from a (trucker aye yo man)
Everybody know I ain't no (sucker)
Every time I used to drop thirty at the (rucker that's it)
Away from the crazy kids in Generation Wrecked
Dissin' pyramids while praisin' projects
(Walk past old folks gettin' no respect!)
Callin' young folks a bunch a no-good rejects
And I walk on

[Chorus]
An eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I? It is I
Now who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been waitin' so long, to get where I'm goin'
An eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee
Now how the hell, can I be free
And who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin'

So I move on (uh-huh) and I walk on (yeah yeah!)
Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on (say word?!)
Why do home gotta be where the negative roam
To be or not to be (so I roll alone)
I'm trapped within, this skin and these bones
Amongst temporary kings, on cellular phones
Can I last, as I walk past
Mad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads
(Walkin' on da bottles and potato chip bags)
Everyone I see got the nerve to brag
Where they from, what they got, and don't own squat
Disrespect where they from and you might get shot
Zombies askin' me, what the latest bomb be
(You shoulda shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy G!)
For okayin' the drug trade and lettin' it be
But I know prison for me, is an industry
So I walk, heard the best things in life be free
(Didn't God make this land and the air that we breathe)
Not for the homeless, don't give a damn about me
In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me
Maybe prison is the skin I'm within
All this time I been sufferin' can't fix it with a Bufferin'
Plus they said I'll never work in this town again (God damn!) 
So I keep on walkin', yeah

[Chorus]

Lil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time
Seen him standin' (on the unemployment line?!)
Which collided with the line of the health clinic
I seen Crazy Stacy, her ass standin' up in it
No more welfare, they cut her Medicaid
(Damn! My momma used to do her braids)
I keep walkin, so they don't see me
But I doubt if they doin' much better than me
So I walk on, never take the planet for granted
I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite
I walked past three brothers, sittin on the porch
With a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports
Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on they ass
As I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs
And one said ""Let's get him for his fuckin' stash""
As I walked fast, past the other yards with grass
Had a little cash, I tried to make it last
From a few deals I made from cleanin' windshields
I ran like a (rally) they caught me in the (alley)
Can't get out the ghetto from New York to (Cali)

You got to tell 'em JUST LIKE THAT, you know what I'm sayin'?

All these brothers around here fiendin' for that crack-a-lack-a-lack
You dig what I'm sayin'? Yo man, all they wanna do is get what you got
But when you ain't got nothin', then they wanna cut you off

So I wreck like I'm posessed by Malcolm X
See the feds want us dead, we too complex
I always speak the truth, comin' from me to you
We movin' as a unit so you know we refuse to lose
I got my eyes on the lies from Washington
I'm a survivor, I know how the West was won
See a show and tell, the way the CoIntel
Undermine the real hip-hop so the cops can trail
But know bad boys move in silence
Save us all from the pain of a life of violence
They tappin my phone, full grown and knowin'
And still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise

[Chorus]
Rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""One more time""
We rise rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""To the beat y'all""

I'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change
Demonstrate and separate the fact from strange
Blame companies killin' our children
When the villain's on the record 
Never think for a second that's the way we live
Wanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV
We quiz knots for the cops at BET
Seize the time, always rhymin' combinin' the antidote
For dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes
Cause I can recollect times when records set
Collect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet
Rest the program, defeat the beastie
Cause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see
And yes it ""Weighs a Ton"" I say it once again
That's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM
It's all fam, we collide we live
Better decide on which side you ride, won't stop until we rise

[Chorus]

Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 

I know the power of fame, ain't never playin' no games
Never croonin' is provin', that we ready for change
Never simpin' but they pimpin' my people, for the dollars
So I holla back it keep us from evil 'til them devils are collared
And like I said it's on, I say it once again
Better know the plan to keep us ignorant
Brother to brother, ain't no other can smother
Or erase my case, we marry words with bass
Just another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin' on
S1's got my back if the clappin' come
Pass on the work, makin' sure the words are known
Keep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin' foes
Keep it goin' strong, nevertheless, know the enemy
And never back down, you can take it to press
'Less the mic like the art dart told you before
We for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise

And a smile can hide all the pain

Public Enemy,"Back
Caught you lookin' for the same thing
It's a new thing, check out this I bring
Uh Oh the roll below the level
'Cause I'm livin' low next to the bass, c'mon
Turn up the radio
They claim that I'm a criminal
By now I wonder how
Some people never know
The enemy could be their friend, guardian
I'm not a hooligan
I rock the party and
Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all
'Cause some they never had this
Number one, not born to run
About the gun 
I wasn't licensed to have one
The minute they see me, fear me
I'm the epitome, a public enemy
Used, abused without clues
I refused to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news
Don't believe the hype 

Yes
Was the start of my last jam
So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something
That we knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang 'em
I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the pope
And pray it ain't dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Don't tell me that you understand
Until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and
Not surrenderin'
I don't rhyme for the sake of of riddlin'
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of 'ya
A rap burglar, false media
We don't need it do we?
It's fake that's what it be to 'ya, dig me?
Don't believe the hype 

Don't believe the hype, its a sequel
As an equal, can I get this through to you
My 98's boomin' with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Comin' from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the black, 'cause I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
Leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a timebomb
In the daytime the radio's scared of me
'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't c'mon and play with me in primetime
'Cause I know the time, plus I'm gettin' mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm livin' right, so here go the mike, sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to herb, yo if you can't swing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy if I swing bolos
Then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that
Some media is the whack
You believe it's true, it blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
For them I say don't believe the hype
Yo Chuck, they must be on a pipe, right?
Their pens and pads I'll snatch
'Cause I've had it
I'm not an addict fiendin' for static
I'll see their tape recoreder and grab it
No, you can't have it back silly rabbit
I'm going' to my media assassin
Harry Allen, I gotta ask him
Yo Harry, you're a writer, are we that type?
Don't believe the hype
I got flavor and all those things you know
Yeah boy, part two bum rush and show
Yo Griff, get the green black red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon
88 you wait the S1Ws will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Teach the bourgeois, and rock the boulevard
Some sau I'm negative
But they're not positive
But what I got to give 
The media says this",Donât Believe the Hype

They don't care cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace they can't be betrayed
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today

That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya

They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a

Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas

Once said to me
He knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep
And at night he went to sleep
And in the mornin' all he had was
The sneakers on his feet

Public Enemy,"Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer, where you never been I'm in
You want stylin', you know it's time again
D the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, the show
Bum rush the sound I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not a sabbatical, yes to make it critical
The only part your body should be parting to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Radio, suckers never play me
On the mix, just O.K. me
Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
Snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns

Recorded and orderd, supporter of Chesimard

Claimin' where we get our rhythm from

No gun, and still never on the run
You want to be an S.1, Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pullin' out the ray-gun
Zap the next one, I could be you're Sho-gun

Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
Hardcore, rawbone like a razor
I'm like a lazer, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this will faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playin' the role I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth, no what I am
Rough, 'cause I'm the man

No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
Yeah, the voice of power
Is in the house, go take a shower boy

We're rap stranglers
You can't angle us, I know you're listenin'

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,

My kin they surround me 
Hesitating there's no second chance 
When you know you're a loser 
Keep on trying keep an open mind 
I'm caught in a circle 

Just walk away 
Just walk away 
Just walk away 
Just walk away

Emotionless I slip into the crack 
Fearless I have fell into the trap 
Hallucinating there's no turning back 
Everyone around me's smoking crack 

Just walk away 
Just walk away 
Just walk away 
Just walk away

Puddle of Mudd,"Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust she fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard  and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

In a trapped trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me

Learned my lesson and so did she

I know that I am unlike them 
Just another situation
Don't hold me back I don't look up to them

They keep themselves so clean
Why can't they find the answers to
The questions that are right in front of me

I hold the sky and I'm never letting go
You filled my cup I'm good to go
So shake me up I'm ready to roll
Go, never letting go

You could be my scene
You know that I will save you

I wonder what you're doing
I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far

Nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to runaway
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say

""I'm so sure"", what a snotty thing to say
Stuck up people always get their way
They think they're so cool
These are the kind of people that you drool over
That is because they don't really care 
Except about their finger nails and their long pretty hair
Go up to one of these girls someday and say ""I think I've found you're cure"" 
And I'll bet they'll turn their back on you and say ""I'm so sure""

I don't wanna be like you [Repeat: x 3]

Every time that I walk in the door
You put me down just a little bit more
You think that you're better than everyone else

Whether there is understanding or not, we continue for now we continue. 

Rain fell and washed away, The wind blew away.

The thing my tired body remembers, yesterday's conversation topic and last year's birthday.
Depending on a familiar picture from a magazine, we left with empty hands we left. 

Night painted out, Flowers bloomed and covered. 

It was as wide as I could see, look at that sky !
Connected to that neighboring land, look at that sea !
For now I've forgotten everything.
I haven't forgotten an honest heart. 

Rain and Wind, Night and Flower You supported me. 

Wherever I may go I bring the huge sun with me.
There are no nuisances to prevent my way. 
I knew I would forget everything. 
I faced tomorrow with my true heart
We swore to the sea and the blue sky.

I've been thinking about it since yesterday
I love you
What else could there be
By your side, wishing and broken
Thoughts of love follow the wind
Into the blue sky
They go beyond reality and
We watch them disappearing
I love you
What else could there be
Went on a trip
It was a very nice trip
Had a beautiful romance",Angel of Love

Don't get distracted
Don't stop, it's a little pathetic
But I'll leave it with you

Bringing back the past
Feels like a long story starting
Promise not to promise

Heart coming apart
Can't see the blur of tomorrow

Unknown road
Sometimes hidden
Sometimes there
I woke up naked
My ordinary life stopped

Body lets go
Lights flipping and melting

Was just selfish and sad

Is just making me mad

Life alone can take us on its twisted path
As we wander down this road not all sure where to go.
Sometimes the scenery can just bore you to death.

As I sit down to write, another day has passed me by,
They all seem the same anymore with so little time to live,
And so much time to kill, how's it
That I still find so much time to be bored?

Am I wasting time, is my purpose being served,
Am I part of a bigger master plan?
Today is all I have, can't change yesterday.

Is the little blue man using me for him?

So does he, but when he goes he'll know if his sin was sin.

We need a purpose, and when it's not too clear
Why all of us are here we follow the path that's made for us.

When we realize that our purpose has no purpose,
That the lives we could have had we all left for dead

When we let our lives be lived for us.

But she settled for the simple life instead,
After years of nine-to-five,

She'd convinced herself she'd need a purpose,
And when it wasn't clear,

I never thought to ask him why.
I could have sworn I heard him say he knew who did it.

He looked into the sun that shone above us
Then he smiled and spoke how good it was.
Yet things change and they stay the same.

There was a stillness as the light set behind us

But for now, I stand proud and never speak loud
And hide all my insecure feelings

You realize it's time to get out

I'm just a little too tired right now

Falling prey, falling prey
Don't follow me

Frozen feelings have always been your being
But the guilt always finds a way in
Not a tear flows through, not a thought
Not a sound and numbness overwhelms me

On my high wire and from the ground to the air
It goes totally unnoticed

And no one really cares if every day,
I hit that peel and stumble down the stairs.
You don't know you don't know the pain.
You can't feel the same.
Many things I want,
That I will never get.
Go through my life without even a little regret.
Some things I need will never come to me
Even if I kneel and pray and squeeze my rosary.
You don't know the pain.
You can't feel the same.
In this life you're always on your own.
Nobody really hears a cry of pain
That sounds like it's alone,
Sounds like it's alone.

Pulley,"Long nights...wide awake in the empty darkness.
Dreading...the alarm that waits at the dawn of day.
I'm anxious...for all the things that I want from life.
I'm tired...now I push my thoughts away.
Long day...tired and sore, abused my body,
Troubled...I find no peace in what I'm paid.
Distracted...the TV takes me from my worries.
Absent...of any progress I have made.
I am nothing more than a dreamer, wasting my life.
Consumed with my passion,
Caught in a world of debts and decisions.
Do I lose it forever or do I hold on I am no different,
Just one of the masses.
Caught up in the task of survival.
I am waiting on days without any worries.
Do I lose it forever or do I hold on?...to my dreams.",Hold On
Pulley,"What the fuck is really going on with me?
I'm not a creature in a circus freak show
Really like to be

Don't feel sorry but there's always pity here
I don't feel sorry for you
Not asking myself to do anything

Going places where I've only dream to go
Waste my time with that
Brighten up this picture one day
Make me laugh

Trying something
What has not been done before
There's nothing left to do
Not asking myself to do anything

What if once I've started building something up
Just to watch it fall, pick it up again
See the pieces right in front of me
Pick it up again, I'm on my way

If you're running 'round
If you're running 'round
There's nothing left for me
There's nothing left for me

Nothing left for me
Nothing left for me

Pulley,"I'm not angry I'm through being mad,
I'm done feeling sorry after you hurt me so bad:
Don't try thinking about me cause I'm already gone.
Not saying that I'm right just telling you you're wrong.
Keeping to myself or am I really locked away?
A childhood of scars I bear that make me feel this way.
Don't relate to people that don't relate to me.
Paste the point of anger,
Will you take me seriously?

People used to laugh don't want to be like them
People who I trust and used to call my friends.
Things are so much easier now your agony is gone.
Sometimes you just don't know you are right
Because someone else is wrong.
It's not a matter of foolish pride that won't let me forgive you.
It's the hatred that I feel inside for trusting you.

And he sees a girl to him fifty summers ago
And again his hands tearing apart.
Sometimes I felt that when the grass was always greener

And the sadness in the sun can turn it blue.
Take a swing up to the sky
And never watch it pass you by,
The carpets rolling out for you.

You hold the reins and I still have control
And I don't know what I would do without you.
Another room, another face,
I smell the anger in this place.

Just to stay alive.
If I had blinked, I would have never of met you.
Could have lived my life content.
But now here I am fucked up again,
Life can be silent torment.
I knew you'd never stay, right from the start.
That's what I get for diving in head first.
My life feels like it's falling apart.
I'm a loser, I'm a failure, I'm a fuck up to the core.

You don't like the way that anybody sounds.
If you don't like it here then why you come around
If you've got nothing valid to say
And won't waste my time saying how long I've been here,
If you can't respect the dues I've paid,
Your thinking isn't clear. it really shouldn't matter,
Should be only what you hear,
But I don't think you're listening anymore.
Spent two hundred thousand miles
With my shit packed in a van,
If the music made us friends,
Then the love made us a band.
If you need an explanation then you'll never understand.
This music's just a part of me grew up with the outside opinion,
An outcast of the inside dominion lived
My whole life against the grain.
It always seemed I was one foot out of step.
Never do anything that anyone would accept.
If that's someone's fault, I'll take the blame.
So now I got a question, where were you in '84?
I'm still touring in a van, sleeping on a strangers' floor.
What we do today is what we used to do before.
Why you want anything more?
Gotta prove you're punk so you rebel against the scene.
So elite admit defeat don't know what you really mean.
If the shows all disappear, is that what you want to see?
Why you gotta ruin it for me?



",Outside Opinion
Pulley,"This is a little story about a lazy old man
It's been years and years
And years gone by without a solid plan

Digging deep for motivation, why it seems so hard to find
He's been living like this for, oh, so long
This way of life is stuck in his mind

A good kick in the ass is what he needs
No one hears his silent pleas
Although people around him would tend to agree
A life of living like this is a bad disease

A will for change is a thought desired
To achieve his goals, to take him higher
In his thoughts he seems to care
But laziness lingers in the air

A fresh breath not polluted with this disease
I can hear him screaming saying pleas, please, please
Help me now, take me by the hand
This rut I'm in, makes me so bland

A good kick in the ass is what he needs
No one hears his silent pleas
Although people around him would tend to agree
A life of living like this is a bad disease
It's a bad disease, it's a bad disease, it's a bad disease

Feeling like a fucking, goddamn slouch

Pulley,"There ain't shit on tv, I got no new pornography.
I got to find a reason to want to stay alive.
Not a word is heard I said,
I might as well just stay in bed.
To find a better way, I doubt I'll even try,
Just another boring story, about a teenage waste of glory.
Trapped in a town, gonna drag you down, my life is such a mess,
I cannot help but feel depressed.
I doubt that anyone would miss me if I wasn't around,
I don't need to know about the things in life that I can't find.
I don't need to know about the things I left behind.
I'm just a lazy slob, I should go out and get a job.
But I won't cause I know that my rent is paid.
I'm a big procrastinator, I can always do it later.
My friends all tell me that I got it made,
It doesn't really matter. what I have to say,
No one's fucking listening anyway.
So until my days are done, or it's no longer any fun.
I'm gonna bore you to death. life is overrated,
I really want to be sedated.
But I change the channel, and I'm watching days of our lives.
It's so sophisticated, watching programs that I hated.
But I guess it's better than working 9-5.
The life that I'm living, it ain't really living.
But I guess I could be working., so I'm free and clear.
So my only friends tv will always keep my company,
As I am watching soap operas downing cheetos and beer!!

Whispers something to a friend.
Plays the songs like he knew his own,
Walk away you're all alone.
Separated it's hard for you,
Wasting time like you only can.
There's much to say, here you are again.
Whoevers' listening this time around,
Seem to doubt about your sound.
What's at home, who's life you live?
Someone asks and you never give.
What you have nobody wants.

Pulp,"Susan catches the bus into town at ten-thirty a.m. she sits on the back seat. she looks at
The man in front's head and thinks how his fat wrinkled neck is like a large carrot
Sticking out from the collar of his shirt. she adds up the numbers on her bus ticket to
See if they make twenty-one, but they don't. maybe she shouldn't bother going to school at
All, then. her friends will be in the yard with their arms folded on their chests,
Shielding their breasts to try and make them look bigger, whilst the boys will be too busy
Playing football to notice. the bus is waiting on the high street when suddenly it begins
To rain torrentially and it sounds like someone has emptied about a million packets of
Dried peas on top of the roof of the bus. 'what if it just keeps raining,' she
Thinks to herself, 'and it was just like being in an aquarium except it was all the
Shoppers and office-workers that were floating passed the window instead of fish? '
She's still thinking about this when the bus goes passed caroline lee's house where there
Was a party last week. there were some german exchange students there who were very
Mature; they all ended up jumping out of the bedroom window. one of them tried to get her
To kiss him on the stairs, so she kicked him. later she was sick because she drunk too
Much cider. caroline was drunk as well; she was pretending she was married to a tall boy
In glasses, and she had to wear a polo-neck for three days afterwards to cover up the
Love-bite on her neck. by now the bus is going passed the market. outside is a man who
Spends all day forcing felt-tip pens into people's hands and then trying to make them pay
For them. she used to work in the pet shop, but she got sacked for talking to boys when
She was supposed to be working. she wasn't too bothered though, she hated the smell of the
Rabbits anyway. 'maybe this bus won't stop,' she thinks, 'and I'll stay on
It until I'm old enough to go into pubs on my own. or it could drive me to a town where
People with black hair drink special brew and I can make lots of money by charging fat old
Men five pounds a time to look up my skirt. oh, they'll be queuing up to take me out to
Dinner...' I suppose you think she's just a silly girl with stupid ideas, but I
Remember her in those days. they talk about people with a fire within and all that stuff,
Well, she had that alright. it's just that no-one dared to jump into her fire; they would
Have been consumed. instead, they put her in a corner and let her heat up the room,
Warming their hands and backsides in front of her, and then slagging her off around town.
No-one ever really got inside susan, and, and, she always ended up getting off the bus at
The terminus and then walking home.

When you lived on Stanhope Road.
We listened to your sister,
When she came home from school,
'cause she was two years older,
And she had boys in her room.
We listened outside and heard her.

Alright.
Well that was alright for a while,
But soon I wanted more.
I want to see as well as hear,
And so I hid inside her wardrobe.
And she came round four,
And she was with some kid called David,
From the garage up the road.
I listened outside I heard her.
Alright.

Oh I want to take you home.
I want to give you children.
You might be my girlfriend, yeah.

When I saw you next day,
I really couldn't tell,
'cause you might go and tell your mother.
And so you went with Neve,
And Neve was coming on,
And I thought I heard you laughing,
When his Mum and Dad were gone.
I listened outside, I heard you.
Alright.

Oh I want to take you home.
I want to give you children.
You might be my girlfriend, yeah.

Well I guess it couldn't last too long.
I came home one day,
And all her things were gone,
I fell asleep inside.
I never heard her come.
And then she opened up her wardrobe,
And I had to get it on.

Oh, listen
We were on the bed when you came home,
I heard you stop outside the door.

""I was only about eleven when this happened. 
We were living in a big block of flats with a central courtyard. 
All the bedroom windows opened onto this court, 
And sometimes in the middle of the night,
In that building it sounded like a mass orgy. 
I may have only been eleven, 
But no-one had to tell me what all that moaning and yelling was about. 
I'd lie there mesmerised, listening to the first couple. 
Invariably, they'd wake up other couples,
And like some kind of chain reaction, 
Within minutes the whole building was fucking.
I mean, have you ever heard other people fucking, and really enjoying it?
It's a marvellous sound. 
Not like in the movies, but when it's real. 
It's such a happy, exciting sound.'

Bigger than any other

Yeah, I wanna be your lover (not your brother, not your mother, yeah)

Crept through the gap in your curtains
And caressed your bare feet poking from beneath the floral sheets. 
I watched it flaking bits of varnish from your nails
Trying to work it's way up under the sheets.

The whole city getting stiff in the building heat.

And the puddles of rain that reflected your face in my eyes. 

The day didn't go too well. 
Too many chocolates and cigarettes. 
I kept thinking of you and almost walking into lamp-posts. 
Why's it so hot (Peace garden!)

Dogs doing it in central reservations and causing multiple pile-ups in the centre of town. 
I didn't want to come here in the first place
But I've been sentenced to three years in the Housing Benefit waiting room.

Tomorrow she will call her friends and go out on her own somewhere

Writing messages on walls and the puddles of rain reflected your face in my eyes.

And time slows down to the speed of the specks of dust
Floating in the light from the window.
Summer leaves fall from Summer trees.
Summer grazes fade on Summer knees.
Summer nights are slowly getting long.
Summer's going so hurry soon it'll be gone.
So we went out to the park at midnight one last time.
Past the abandoned glasshouse stuffed full of dying palms. 
Past the bandstand down to the boating lake.
And we swam in the moonlight for what seemed like hours,
Until we couldn't swim anymore.
And as we came out of the water we sensed a certain movement in the air,
And we both shivered slightly and ran to collect our clothes.
And as we walked home we could hear the leaves curling and turning
Brown on the trees,
And the birds deciding where to go for Winter.
And the whole sound,
The whole sound of Summer packing it's bags and preparing to leave town.
Oh but I want you to stay.
Oh please stay for a while,

The time when the ceiling sways and objects jerk out of place

curtains drawn tight against the cold night air
to a flight of stairs
which lead to a room
where a bed is waiting for you to lie down 
perhaps alone, perhaps not
and go to sleep again

in unused rooms
they sit and they remember
Oh, please remember
So you lie on your back in the dark
and listen to the blood rushing in your ears
and the soft ""tick, tick, tick"" of your watch against the mattress springs
Patterns merge behind your eyes
Purple and green, glowing gently
and all is soft with furry darkness
You yawn once 
turn on your side
and fall to sleep again

They wait alone
they bathed your eyes 
when nights were cold

Oh, please remember 

There's something you've forgotten
When you awoke later that night the bedroom was cold and you were alone
Alone and afraid of the dark

With wood chip on the wall

And has been like this for several months
If I close my eyes, I can visualise everything in it
Right down
Right down to the broken handle on the third drawer down of the dressing table

And the world outside this room
Has also assumed a familiar shape
The same events shuffeled in a slightly different order each day
Just like a modern shopping centre

And it's so cold
Yeah, it's so cold
What is this feeling called love?
Why me, why you?
Why here, why now?

It doesn't make no sense, no
It's not convenient, no
It doesn't fit my plans, no
It's something I don't understand, oh

L-O-V-E, what is this thing that is happening to me? (and as I touch your shoulder tonight this room has become the centre of the entire universe)

So what do I do?
I've got a slightly sick feeling in my stomach
Like I'm standing on top of a very high building, oh, yeah
All the stuff they tell you about in the movies
But this isn't chocolate boxes and roses, it's dirtier than that

Like some small animal that only comes out at night
And I see flashes of the shape of your breasts
And the curve of your belly
And they make me have to sit down and catch my breath

And it's so cold
And it's so cold
What is this feeling called love?
Why me, why you?
Why here, and why now?

Skilfully avoiding the dog turd next to the corner shop""

Very seriously indeed.

Smoking your cigarettes
Drinking your brandy
Messing up the bed that you chose together

And catch us at it in the front room
You see I spy for a living
And I specialize in revenge
On taking the things I know will cause you pain
I can't help it
I was dragged up

My favorite parks are car parks
Grass is something you smoke
Birds are something you shag
Take your ""Year in Provence"" and shove it up your ass

Your Ladbroke Grove looks turn me on, yeah
With roach burns in designer dresses
Skin stretched tight over high cheek-bones
And thousands of tiny dryness lines beating a path to the corners of your eyes
And every night I hatch my plan, It's not a case of woman v man

It's more a case of haves against haven'ts
And I just happen to have got what you need
Just exactly what you need, yeah

Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today""

I feel as if my whole life has been leading to this one moment.
And as I touch your shoulder tonight,
This room has become the centre of the entire universe.
So what do I do? I've got a slightly sick feeling in my stomach,
Like I'm standing on top of a very high building, oh yeah.
All the stuff they tell you about in the movies,
But this isn't chocolate boxes and roses.
It's dirtier than that,
Like some small animal that only comes out at night.
And I see flashes of the shape of your breasts,
And the curve of your belly,
And I may have to sit down and catch my breath.

Why me, why you, why here.

The gist of all this is,
Do you want hist or do you want misses?,
Are you a socialist,
Socialist, socialist,

You can be just what you want to be,
Just as long as you don't try and compete with me,
And we've waited such a long time for a chance to help our own kind,
Please come on and tow the party line,
You owe it to yourself,
Don't think of anyone else,
We promise we won't tell,
We won't tell,
We won't, tell.",Cocaine Socialism
Pulp,"Hey man, 
how come you treat your woman so bad? 
That's not the way you do it. No, no, no..
you shouldn't do it like that. 
I could show you how to do it right. 
I used to practice every night on my wife now she's gone. Yeah, she's gone. 

You see your mother and me 
we never got along that way you see. 
I'd love to help you but everybody's telling me you look like me
but please don't turn out like me. 
You look like me 
but you're not like me I know. 
I had one, two, three, four shots of happiness. 
I look like a big man but I've only got a little soul. 
I only got a little soul. 

Yeah, I wish I could be an example.
Wish I could say I stood up for you and
fought for what was right. But I never did. 
I just wore my trenchcoat and stayed out every single night. 
You think I'm joking? Well, try me. Yeah, try me. Yeah come on, try me tonight.
I did what was wrong though I knew what was right. 
I've got no wisdom that I want to pass on. Just don't hang 'round here, no, 
I'm telling you son. You don't wanna know me. 
Oh, that's just what everybody's telling me. 

& everybody's telling me you look like me but please don't turn into me. 
You look like me but you're not like me I hope. 
I have run away from the one thing that I ever made. 
Now I only wish that I could show you - wish I could show a little soul. 
Wish I could show a little soul. [x3]",A Little Soul [Original Mix]

Pulp,"This is our ""Music from A Bachelors Den"" -
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten.
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant water-bed
And it sounds just like this.
This is the sound of someone losing the plot -

Making out that they're okay when they're not.
You're gonna like it,
But not a lot
And the chorus goes like this:

Oh baby,
Here comes the fear again.
The end is near again.
A monkey's built a house on your back. 

You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack
Oh here we go again.

So now you know the words to our song,
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along.
When you're sad, when you're lonely
And it all turns out wrong.

When you've got the fear.
And hen you're no longer searching 
For beauty or love -
Just some kind of life

With the edges taken off.
When you can't even define what it is that you're frightened of
This song will be here.

Oh baby,
Here comes the fear gain.
The end is near again.
If you ever get that chimp off your back.

If you ever find the thing that you lack
But you know you're only having a laugh
And here we go again.
Until the end.",The Fear [the Complete and Utter Breakdown Version]
Pulp,"The dust has settled
Replace the bulbs in all the lights
I guess I'll get no sleep tonight
A revolution happened

Oh, sorry, you haven't heard?
We are the children of the new world
If you're quiet you can watch if you like
They say the future's beginning tonight
Whole empires will crumble, civilizations will fall

Lie on the bed, hear the sound of it all
No anger, no guilt and no sorrow
It sounds unlikely, I know, but tomorrow
You will wake up to find that your whole life has changed
Although nothing looks different, a revolution took place

I love the way you do it
I love the way you put them on
You know the answers but you get it wrong
Just to confuse things

Why did it seem so difficult to realise a simple truth?
The revolution begins and ends with you
Now all the breakdowns and nightmares look small
Now we decided not to die after all

'Cause the meek shall inherit absolutely nothing at all
If you stopped being so feeble you could have so much more
The answer was here all the time, you see
Just how I missed it is a mystery to me
I have waited and waited for this day to arrive
The revolution was televised
Now it's over, bye bye
It's over, bye bye
It's over, bye bye

Yeah, we made it
Just by the skin of our teeth
Perfection is over
Sheffield is over
The Fear is over
Guilt is over (please leave the building quietly)

Bergerac is over
The hangover is over, men are over, women are over
Cholesterol is over
Tapers are over
Bergman is over, irony is over
Bye-bye",The Day After the Revolution
Pulp,"I am not Jesus though I have the same initials
I am the man who stays home and does the dishes
And how was your day?
Is that woman still trying to do your head in?
A man told me to beware of thirty-three
He said
""It was not an easy time for me""
But I'll get through
Even though I've got no miracles to show you.

I'd like to make this water wine
But it's impossible
I've got to get these dishes dry

I'll read a story if it helps you sleep at night
I've got some matches if you ever need a light
Oh, I am just a man
But I'm doing what I can to help you

I'd like to make this water wine
But it's impossible
I've got to get these dishes dry

And I'm, I'm not worried that I will never touch the stars
'Cause stars belong up in heaven
And the earth is where we are
Oh, yeah
And aren't you happy just to be alive?
Anything's possible
You've got no cross to bear tonight
No, not tonight
No, not tonight
I am not Jesus though I have the same initials",Dishes
