Delaney Walsh,"How many days has it been
Since I was born
How many days until I die
Do I know any ways
That I can make you laugh
Or do I only know how to make you cry

When the baby looks around him
It's such a sight to see
He shares a simple secret
With the wise man

He's a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land
Tell me why
He's a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land

How many miles will it take
To see the sun
And how many years until it's done
Kiss my confusion away in the night
Lay by side when the morning comes

And the baby looks around him
And shares his bed of hay
With the burrow in the palace of the king

He's a stranger in a strange land
Tell me why
He's a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land

Well, I don't exactly know
What's going on in the world today
Don't know what there is to say
About the way the people are treating
Each other, not like brothers

Leaders take us far away from ecology
With mythology and astrology
Has got some words to say
About the way we live today
Why can't we learn to love each other
It's time to turn a new face
To the whole world wide human race

Stop the money chase
Lay back, relax
Get back on the human track
Stop racing toward oblivion
Oh, such a sad, sad state we're in
And that's a thing

Do you recognize the bells of truth
When you hear them ring
Won't you stop and listen
To the children sing
Won't you come on and sing it children

He's a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land",Stranger In a Strange Land
Delays,"Underneath the table for shade
I leave you to the living again
Arabesque a flowery grave
I watch a real star winning

Over this twilight
Shouting at Jesus
Absolute closeness
Could be beneath us

If you
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love
It leaves me nothing to know
Just a stationary role
In your bedroom scene

Maybe what I'm trying to say is
I lost you in translation
To lover from the hand of a friend
Too much, too hard to mention

So don't
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love

Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love",Bedroom Scene

And your a long time coming 
A long time coming home. 
Do you see me reeling 
Off the lines I've seen your

How can you grow old you were my triumph 
How can you grow old you were my triumph 

Turn your face into the squall.

You carved your name into the wall

Delays,"You are nearer than heaven
I get the feeling I get nearer by the day
I've seen the people go forever descending
It's when we're all inside that summer's on the way

Bullet took it easy dollar lit the room
Monsters making the evening news
Packing up a round trip, I get in the way

Now I know that
You are nearer than heaven
I get the feeling I get nearer by the day
I've seen the people go forever descending
It's when we're all inside that summer's on the way

Delays,"I've seen you hanging from blistering skies
Holding yourself with a grace that defies
Law after law as well spit in the eye
Fall on me when you come down

You've seen me panic and kick without sight
Of any danger except what I might
Know of myself and see in you tonight
Fall on me when you come down

The air is thin and hard to breath
With sweetness that you lost to me
Despite the noose around that kiss
I try to tell myself this is
No ending

Seeing you buzzing from flickering signs
Bringing on warnings of incoming fire
Blood on your hands from the tongue of a liar
Fall on me when you come down

The air is thin and hard to breath
With sweetness that you lost to me
Despite the noose around that kiss
I try to tell myself this is
No ending
It's no ending

Leaving alone and I see you're still breathing
Head out of sight, but the neon's deceiving
There is no danger of you getting anywhere here

I know I'm prone to rushing in
With no pretense of listening
Despite this noose around our kiss
I try to tell myself this is
No ending
It's no ending",No Ending

Delays,"There's nothing in the morning
Just flowers and a feeling
That yesterday was stalling
For time to let the scene in

But you know how everything grows
And you know the feeling is love
But you're one night away
You're one night away

The snow has started falling
And covered our graffiti
I wander through the city
To find we're still in evening

But you know how everything grows
And you know the feeling is love
But you're one night away
You're one night away
Oh you're one night away

The feeling is love

Delays,"This satellites lost,
Where has the fire gone
Down deeper he knows,
There's
Still a chance to find it
But should he stay lost,
You are the reason you are the
Cause
This satellite's lost,
But I know that he wants you

I know you're there,
I can
Hear you breathe
It only takes a minute

To get yourself lost watching the day
Dissolve
Down deeper he knows,
There's still a chance to find it

I know you're there,
I can hear you breathe
It only takes a minute
And though you're there you can surely
See
It only takes a minute
Oh no

Nobody's gonna wait for you (3x)

Looks like trouble, trouble
Distant sound

Delbert McClinton,"Caught a ride in South Dakota
With two girls in a light blue Desoto
One's names was Jane
The other was plain
But they both had racing motors

Next I caught a ride with a gamblers wife
She had a brand new laid down Rambler
She parked outside of town
And laid the rambler down
And said she sure could dig it if I rode her

I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing' I'd rather do
Look for me someday
I'm gonna be there, honey
With something special just for you

At a truck stop for toothpick and water
Caught a ride with a fruit picker's daughter
We drove into the night
Said 'The fruit's just right'
She said all I could eat for a quarter

Next I caught a ride with a hobo woman
Who said she was from Texas too
The way she did what she did
When she did, what she did to me
Made me think of you

Bet all my money on a race horse baby
One they said can't lose
Now I'm down here in the pouring rain
Trying to get to you, Trying to get to you

And I'm walking and I'm talking to myself
And it's raining and I'm freezing to death
Trying to get to you, trying to get to you

Delbert McClinton,"You promised a new world
You showed me and made me believe it did exist
And now you pretend you don't know me
And you say that world was a mess

I woke up and the world was gone
And I never felt so all alone
It was cold and dark without a dawn
When I woke up and the world was gone

That world you promised, you gave me honey
I was there every time we kissed
And when your world had enslaved me
That world you promised went a mist

I woke up and the world was gone
And I never felt so all alone

Wasn't botherin' nobody, wasn't botherin' a soul
I saw a woman's picture on a warnin' sign
She had the face of an angel and the eyes of a child

Wondered why was it hangin' in this lonely place
There was fine print hangin' beneath her face
Like clothes hangin' on a line

Said, watch out men 'cause this pretty girl

Just to see if this rustler could be found
Well, low and behold, to my surprise
She laid a kiss on me hotter than a brandin' iron
She came on tough, she came on strong
She calf-tied my soul, now I can't leave her alone

When she told me to buck, I buck
When to move, I move
When she told me to jump, I jump
When to woo, I woo
She dug her spurs into my mind and rode me to the ground
If I had the will or strength, I'd crawl outta town

Delbert McClinton,"Standing on the bank of a river
By the shore
Seems like the devil's always tryin'
To get in my door
Just when I thought I
Couldn't take it anymore
Here he came again
My friend
He keeps sending me angels,
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels,
To teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels,
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels,
Just... like... you...
As I stand on this mountain
Face to the wind,
Amazed by the number of times I have sinned,
And the countless number of enemies
That should have been friends
Here he comes again,
My friend
He keeps sending me angels,
Here they come a-flyin'
He keeps sending me angels,
To keep me from cryin'
He keeps sending me angels,
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels,
Just... like... you...
Some say that it's comin'
I say that it's already here
The love that's among us through
The joy and the fear
When I look into your eyes
Everything is so clear
My friend, oh here he comes again
He keeps sending me angels,
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels,

Delbert McClinton,"You need a job so you can make some money
You need a nice warm place to stay
A sense of humor cause life is funny
A big stick to keep the wolves away

You need a car with good tires on it
And the right place to eat barbecue
A heavy duty set of jumper cables
And no holes in your walkin' shoes

The main thing you gonna find you need
Is a fertile place to plant the seed now

You got to find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share it with and be part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I recommend you get some life insurance
Be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
And stay away from the man with a gun

You need a reason to get up in the morning
Make sure your clock has a snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can sure get cold

You're gonna find out sooner or later
You need a common denominator

You got to find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share it with and be part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I saw a billboard 'bout this rodeo
Last weekend out in El Paso
So I signed up to ride

I drew a bull called Original Sin
Heard he'd killed a couple of men
Figured this was somethin' I could win
'Cause the devil's on my side

I was havin' myself one hell of a ride
When I, I ended up disqualified

Thought, I'd paid all my dues
Then them South Texas blues

Had them East Texas blues
And them West Texas too
I've done all I know to do
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose these lone star blues

I got laid off at Brown and Root
On my way back to Cut and Shoot
I lost my wristwatch and my boots
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston

There ain't no jobs here workin' cattle
So I got on part time haulin' gravel
With some outfit from Seattle
Down here buildin' custom homes

I gassed up my truck and packed my clothes
Turned in my key and hit the road
I said, Cowtown's where I'll go
You never know I might get lucky

I got a friend there turning knobs
At this place called Billy Bob's
Said he could get me a job
There workin' as a bouncer

First night on the job was just insane
Some ol' boy got all deranged
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain

A rag tag congregation is gathered at the bar
Searching for salvation for just an hour or two

They take the wine 'til closing time, a fellowship of fools
Confessions heard, forgiveness given from twelve o'clock 'til two

But her broken wings still have the strength to hold you when you cry

The day that you left, I promised myself
That I was gonna be just fine

I ran away to a room here on the bay
Interrupted life again, another new beginning
Where the silence echoes
You're no longer with me

I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone
But that's okay

Through the darkness 
I would walk in the streets
Confessions never seemed
To provide me with a release
Held me down and tried to cure me
Tried to give me reason
But nothing could sepearate
This burdened mind from me

Here and now
I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
Looking out to a different sky will disengage me
Absence is never the answer, I know
But it serves as my shade

I do not seek and not intend to find
A calmer ocean or a sun that'll never rise
My world will never change
And time will bring you to my thoughts
I'll move on and forget you all over again
Moving on, I can forgive you all over again

Here and now
I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
And looking out onto a different sky
It seems so easy

Delerium,"And how I've loved
And I have served
And I have sinned
But I have learned
As long as you are true to the life that you live
This is the time to feel love

I feel a stirring deep within
Slowly picking up momentum
Like the tide coming into shore
Over and under in it's course

This feeling emblazed inside
Every nerve like a firefly
Hovering above me
Glow glow glowing divine

Every nerve like a firefly
Every nerve like firefly
This feeling emblazed inside
Every nerve like a firefly

I never want to loose
What I have finally found
There's a requiem

And it's telling me go forward
And walk under a brighter sky

Anger is your bow and arrow
It's better than a shield for your sorrow
But nothing's hurting inside

You hide your pride

Can't you see, can't you see
You are your own worst enemy

All the good things you have
Always end up with someone else
And you blame that they are stealing
All the big plans you made
Will explode and you'll suffocate

Ooh on the day you came to me
The way that you paralyze - no disguise

Lost in a sea of love

Search a solution to save us from pain

Ran out the door, and into the parking lot
Gunned the engine of his '59 Chevrolet Apache truck
Left a little rubber at Sears & Roebuck
Down-shifted, passed a Camaro, made a left at the light
Headed down the boulevard headed for Friday night

Pocketful of diamonds, a pocketful of diamonds
And wings on both of my heels
Close your eyes, make a wish, count on up to three
Open them up now can't you see
All I've got is all you need

Hit the brakes up on the curb leaned into the horn
Mary shouted I'll be right down from the window on the second floor
Her momma yelled, ""Get home early, I don't care if it's Friday night""
She ran down the walk laughing, ""We'll be home before it's light""
Headed out to the Palomino, best jukebox around
To forget about the last five days and get a little loud

Pocketful of diamonds, a pocketful of diamonds
And wings on both of my heels
Close your eyes, make a wish, count on up to three
Open them up now can't you see

Reached in his pocket, he pulled out a handful of lint
Laughed right out loud as he tossed it into the wind
Up above in the sky strings of party lights
Old Hank Ballard, bless his soul, made them dance night
Ain't it funny, what a lark how far you can go
When you've got a pocketful of diamonds the world is made of gold

I’m hosting the blame when my ego’s bruised
I’m pointing the gun towards my oldest friend
I’ll carry your heart till the bitter end

Now you own a lifetime, of woes,
But they ain't mine

You know I love you so,
Even though I can't let you know
You know I love you so,
Forgetting all of my trials
You know I left you lonely
You always leave me with doubt
You know I love you so,
And so, and so, and so, and so

I'm falling apart at my every seam
I'm chasing my tail whilst you chase your dream
Inhaling the stench of my love's betrayal
Keep ignoring the signs, darling you'll prevail

Cause you own a lifetime, of woes,
But they ain't mine
And you sold my life line
So I'm blue when the bell chimes

You know I love you so,

You know I left you lonely

I know you leave me lonely
I know you leave me lost
Still my heart goes

Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
I've often wondered how long it's gonna take me
In this world until the good Lord shake me
And to the man I put up with mad sorrow
But I learned soon the sun still shines tomorrow
Sometimes bad thoughts they brought me down
Growin up hard livin' poor side of town
Cause where I was I wondered who will ever need me?
But now I know that much love flew freely
My momma my poppa both took care
No matter what I did I knew they would be there
Ball in the school yard puppy love crushes
Mischief in the nightime with intimate touches
Playin' with the females Christmas was cool
Didn't have much but had enough fool
So here's three cheers beers up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
So if you think all of your life was bad
Reminisce on all the good times you had

[Verse 2]
Well it was once upon a time in the seventies a baby boy bounces
Placed on this earth wayin' seven and some ounces
But that wasn't all of the bouncin'
It was hard for mom to try to keep the proper housin'
Straight from Gardena before my sista Linda
Migrated to the East Side projects Maravilla
There I had my stroll on Rigin' Elementary
Moms a quarter century pop left us on empty
But that was nothin' new though packin up our shit so
We could make the move Cudahay was the zip code
Moms working fingers to the bone just to make ends meat
I was a latch key delinquent daily runnin' the street
And every time I look back I think of just anotha challenge
Holidays and birthdays grim still I managed
To key a smile making life fun
And how can I forget about the seasons in the sun?
So here's three cheers beer up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]",Good Times
Delinquent Habits,"Come on, man, give me a dime

My brains gettin’ heavy, I feel mad rejection
I feel the rushin’ of your funk injection
So let me all have it all shit that’s funky
And let me get to tweakin’ off this here chumpy
Drink up a cup of the distilled funk
It ain’t aged 12 years but it’s potent, punk
I ain’t passed out yet, I can’t stop but I’m close
To the 12-bore sureshot overdose
You see my heart palpitations pound with no limit
Another round comes down, I’m all up in it

I’m addicted, I’m a junkie
That’s why I got to fiendin’ for the shit that’s funky
I’m addicted, I’m a junkie
That’s why I got to fiendin’ for the shit that’s funky

I’m just a addict addicted

Can ya please o.g. give me just another hit
Please o.g. I fiend ya for the funky shit
Bring it on now and let me rip the microphone
Wit’ the new style and make it funky to the bone now
Let me back up in this
I need another fix, I’m knockin’ doors off hinges
Coz I’m the type I have to take it all no strain
Just load it up and drop the beat now please inject my vein
There’s a chemical breakdown and balanced reaction
And I ain’t gettin’ down with just a portion of the fraction of the funk
No joke, I need it all, indeed

Kemo, O.G., Victor, Gigi, Pesci look hard and you'll see me

If you can feel me open up let me slam now
Hard than a muthafucka hush sho nuff

Not the kingpin ask em all fool I thought I told ya
I'm just a little bolder than your average soldier
Staring at you psycho hey what's a huero loco?
Twisted out mental mad whacked in the coco
Never givin' up I got wisdom persistence
Two clips loaded in a glock for resistance
A flock of delinquentes steppin' through the silence
Mellow type of fellow still poised for the violence

Blaxican warrior fuckin' up your blind side

This be for the hard-core O.G. real funk fans
The ones that pumpin' up the party
Jump and shake your hands
And let your joint blaze smoke up and get a little higher
If the cherry goes out then relight the fire
Pump it up and do this swing for mine baby
Ives in the party ya'll time to get crazy
Swing it left swing it right swing it back and to the front ha
No takin' or the fakin' cause we givin' what you want ha
Pure bread born and raised the underground system
My recipes so ill you'll think I'm crazy if I list em
So I choose to freak it from the dawn till the light
To let you listen' hard to what it be like

[Chorus 2X]
What it be like tell me what it be like
What it really be like what it be like
What it be like tell me what it be like
Do you know what it be like cause I know what it be like

I'm steppin' up back up straight up so delinquente
You won't be saying shit after I sock you in the frente
So what's it gonna be sucka what it be like?
As I descend from the trend every muthafuckin' night
And so I gotta keep the rhymes kinda funky you know
I'm still rollin' in the jacked up Chevy '64
You need to ease back sucka you need to pipe down
Delinquent type of hound is what you're gettin' from the realm
When I'm steppin' through the fog my dogs are kinda fatal
I'll swat you like a fly that's on my kitchen table
If another day ends still a new dawn breaks
And once again I'm droppin' shit upon this 2 inch tape

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
See this be like discussion of the facts
Over hip-hop chords
The Lower EastSide allow me kick the funk no fraud
See it's the third time for the Ives my news flash
No matter what I'm still gonna be the poor white trash
Diggin up and out the ghetto
Hard raised and rockin'
From backspinnin' from freakin' the beat and pop-lockin'
From early days I'm steppin' to battle like a vulture
It's all just a part of the hip-hop culture

I'm predisposed for abuse I can take it so bring the pain steady
The thunder clouds they gonna open and let it rain heavy
I'm bringin' storms full of hail stones cyclones turning
I'm shootin' lightning my fingertips got your fields burning
Now I'm a stand back slam it and watch what I deliver
The idle thoughts of the huero loco to make you shiver
I got my mind on the struggle they tryin to make me fold
I keep on freakin' and tourin' to push my record gold
Keep money comin' is somethin' but what's the real earning
I blaze the weed and love it to keep the wheels turnin'
So what's up partner you know what you be doin's wrong
Bitin' my homie O.G. and Delinquente's song
The clock's tickin' for no man will time wait
So do not test me cause you know not what's my mind state
I take the consequence anotha level higher
I stand back yo dust combust and catch fire...

I'm takin it into battles daily fool
You know what's up so do not step and try to play me cool
O.G.'s in the back with scratches back to throw chingasos
Hit it hard core like I'm trippin' pumpin' to throw putasos
You don't know who be comin' up step in the ride

Heard that O.G. and Blaxican got some dogs to drop
And rip the funk like this until the madness stops

It's outta control pandemonium delinquency
I see these Latins and they're linin' up to do somethin'
They're makin' moves like they're settin' out to prove somethin'
But I ain't proving shit makin' moves yes but never the less
The gloomy West want to put me to the test
Still these pop quizzes I'm passin' with flyin' colors
And these nasty habits is snappin' to make the haters stutter
Stick and move pursue that funky Latin groove
That O.G. Style provides that shit is beautiful

I move with speed and elegance knowin' who got my back though
Don't run with fools who take chances the dance is on and I'm a
I went from strugglin' hustla to strugglin' chart climber
It seems like I can't wait for nothin' but I'm a persevere
There's only heartache and sadness now is it worth it here?
Now I'm a keep on rockin' watch and move along
To keep on bumpin' and freakin' the delinquentes song
Cause I got dreams and ambitions just like the next man
My mission back on the road and freak the next jam

Step back when I bring the swing

Makin' all funky like a futa 
Hang, four to you make more funky like a from free 
Masta, blocked like a ketshup scream 
Is so MB in sun llamas to you funk that grill 
Is the same delificius at the radios' DJ 
The fake at the album collection, lookin' lookin' 
Rusia, puro delinquente session 
>From sun up to sun down on a heart is my pleassure 
Put on maleta, now I can see you 
Thinkin' to yourself, dam I wish like to be you 
Wishin' we could be fool as harvest bit club 
You pal never trust to mark wako back yard party 
That is on town, is on town... 
That grows like the weels 
Can't loco with sprees 
Marco Polo, ha, you can't see me

Who's that rap king got the party start jumpin'
Blasting too high no need for the boo-ya
My hammer with the one knock I'll shoot through ya
Step to the crowd I feel the strain
Those chingazos in the moshpit feel for pain
So don't get in my way baby
Because the guero loco came in here to play baby

The blaxican once again with the cocktail pin
As I emerge from the depths of the realm my son
I got the black gat fat track, coke to rum
Otra vez ya lo ves in the crew somos tres.
One blaxican on the squad you don't test
Sittin' hard like and an Aztec swift like a Zooloo
That's what it's like when the pump shot through ya
My manner is the mildest till the punks get piled
My number one assassin flips the mad funk styles

",It's the Delinquentes
Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
I see them punk putos they coolin' by the lockers
Sellin' crystal to their women fine freaks turned flaca
Your lady say she love you but you locked inside
I heard you slipped they caught you rollin' with some dope in your ride
Your lady said she'll wait love don't come cheap
She'd rather see in the pinta than six feet deep
But can't she see that in the pinta you're a soldier
They take ya break ya make ya and mold ya
Turn you into somethin' way loco hard
Surviving scraps and jacks earning your stripes on the yard
Every night thinking about the good ol days
Look at the picture of your ruca on the wall and pray say
Por favor perdon a pecado won't you come into and save me why sabes que I'm feelin' hollow
So look into your saviors eyes and see tears
Shed for you loco and all these years

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for the vato locked down and then
I shed a tear for his girl waitin' to see him again
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die

[Verse 2]
Freakas of the funk yo it's the funk freakas
The dog's out the yard and he's loud in your speakas
Stompin' with my compas or should I say my back up
Crusing in the Impala countin' feria that we stacked up
Delinquents pick the slack up I be the first to act up
Deal with all these puntos but first I fuck the track up
Do what I got to do in the quest for the paper
I don't give a fuck if it puts me in danger
Dealin' with the anger that everyone has
Sometimes it makes me feel like a psychopath
I put it on tape and you know I won't lie
I'll be down with the Habits even after I die

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for you vatos won't you change your ways
I shed a tear for you vatos in these last days
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die

[Verse 3]
There must be 50 ways to break it down ya'll
There must be 50 ways to let you know
But now they come like what's up muthafuckas it's best to move back
Click clack goes the cuete snap goes the neck
From your canton right up to my canton
It seems that everybody want to be el mas chingon
We move alone or in packas collect ferria in stockas
We got no love for them ratas chest flesh full of placas
And would you strike me down will I feel the wrath
To protect my own another's life is lost in the aftermath
No indecisions mind state makin' moves with precision
See the good turn bad and confirm that I'm livin'
Between Heaven and Hell this be the gloomy old West
Where many souls get lost and many more lie to rest

[Chorus]
I shed a tear for the vatos in street that's dyin'
I shed a tear for the mamas that's at home cryin'
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die",Shed a Tear
Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
It's time to amount an enormous amount of muscle
Move in like 5th batalian while woofers gonna bring trouble
Que quieres a mia moving to make me a little somethin'
Won't catch me chasin' the dragon adrenelin got me pumpin'
Stop take a breath collect my thoughts
Release defenses and check senses
Pull jacks in dope spots
Puff boom muthafucka I swirve and hit the center
Hit it silver star style while others afraid to enter
Bravery in the battle homes I ain't no doubt
We stand alone usually we left the third click out
That's why we moved on cause mental spirits was gettin' broken
By some leech muthafuckas best kill em because we chokin'
Send a heat seeker to take a section of the industry
Not paranoia you really think they feelin' me?
I cut their finger from hand and cut their hand from wrist shit
Light another joint time to get lit

[Chorus 8X]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans

[Verse 2]
Now everybody checkin' the lingo you know I bringo
(Strong arm tactics) represento fresco raw through the weso
why digo trucha con tususia cuando entro con el latin lingo
Collecting masa across the map like Desperado steelo
Now you can bust and I can bust but
Who got that gold in they clutch?
And I'm tremendo cuando prendo lenos down to the crutch
So if we hittin' la botella then let's gulp it all down
And if we hittin' yerba buena then let's smoke the whole pound
The LowerEast is back up in this muthakilla for realla
Los Delinquentes rifan todo Sur Califa I figure
My DNA is everlasting

[Chorus 8X]",This Is L.A.
Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
Somebody's knockin' on the door somebody's ringin' the bell
Somebody's knockin' on the door and we got em all scared as hell
But you ain't gotta open up still I bust through
Like a Mac truck rollin' over them guts
En la back of la traila you know I got mis amigos
Los camaradas to these Lower EastSide Angelinos
Mis perros mi guardan
Muerden know ladran feel a seizure coming on if I sick em on ya
Soy Blaxicano Latino El Pistolero
Snatch a crown off the king and wipe it all on my huevos
Ankles I bust you best invest in a brace
I'm makin' moves shake and bake and then I eat the whole plate
I'm psyclone like a dog for his bone you take a piece of my pie
Well then it's on why va star cabrone
Cause when you're fuckingg with the bull it's the horns you get
I gotta pierce that epidermis when I go for your neck
(And I'm serio) a no lo crees pendejo te dejo
Patadon a los huevos cacheton a lo sesos

It's mi costa the West is reclaimed by this critical acclaimed
Underated still I wreck your main frame
It's mi costa wallah don't make a sah
I'm about to put it on ya I came I'm gonna

[Verse 2]
I'm tense nervous about my inside feelin'
But I still keep muthafuckas dancin' on the ceilin'
Watch the smoke rise Ives burned but still I
Floss Delinquente compound the real high
Fuego to leno leno to boca
Bird finger flippin' trippin' off the chota
Smooth with the west wind chest plate to vest in
I smoke a toke of mari to my chest in
I ain't violent mira I'm just a stoner
Rockin' Lower EastSide sunny Southern California
Flows start to rockin' if shit gets to poppin'
Bloody knuckle style moppin' if teeth get to droppin'
You could keep the style rockin with breakin' or loose lockin'
Even if the pigs come knockin' we won't be stoppin'

Chale me vale madre you fuck around I'll pull a hale
Delinquentize todos Sur Cali
So sit back relax put on your head gear
Let me work this beat like an offic-ier
It's mi costa the West is reclaimed by this critical acclaimed
Underrated still I wreck your main frame
I be that one huero loco psyclone in la mente
Claimin el tereno feelin muy excelente
See last year I took it straight up to your frente
To penetrate your coco flexin con el huero loco
Back up on the scene to smash your pipe dream
You can run but you can't hide when my sac swings
See it's the pendulum cuttin' baby shake their but and
In fact tell you somethin' fool you ain't nothin'

Delinquent Habits,"[Verse 1]
Book me a flight to 30 cities round this land
Give me a fat sack of weed and some cash in hand
Some vatos that can handle themselves out on the road
And I guaran-damn-tee you the spot will explode
I want to rock Sur Califa Midwest known to deliver
Gettin stoned lookin' out over the Hudson River
See we poppin' worldwide West to East
Anywhere there's stomach acid in the belly of the beast
Where teeth is grittin' rundown but still hittin'
In their rides top tippin' with my cut straight dippin'
Be the type to leave you dazed out blowin' snot bubbles
Like a late-night bud binge face down in the puddle
If there's one thing I've learned in my travels that's ironic
We all the same it's just we smoked different chronic
We are carnales homes it's like you didn't know
You're the reason I came I think it's time to flow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've been around in the game much longer than you can figure
All across the map to keep my pocket book bigger
The late-night binges the all-night party
Daily gettin' twisted off the herb and Bacardi
Rollin with my homeboys but they more like family
Started in the West now to the East is where they're flyin' me
A first class ticket we flyin' overseas
Crossing the Atlantic feeling Germany's breeze
Pissin' in the snow right down beside the Autobon
Shook the spot in Hamburg ended up in Amsterdam
Hit the skies again back home to my Califas
A little champagne the huero's high off the reefa
Let's take a little trip down south of the border
Chillin' con mis compas tequila is in order
That's how it goes now I'm headed back home
Livin' on the road till my record sells gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No matter how you see it now it's quite the same
You can tour with or for that platinum fame
I give a damn about the fame homeboy now you can keep that
I tour for the crema the masa the fucking straight cash
Fame don't pay the bills that's on the real
Only cash from my rola with that mass appeal
I got all y'all in my sights tonite
You should be pumpin' like a hydro if all goes right
I plan to rock my funky rolas from the gates of California
Jams like a bug-a-boo all up on ya
Passin' entrance aw you know
I can't fight it yo I think it's time we go...

Outside of everybody's outskirts and principal
This here's a place where all our minds get spent
Self-destruction meet a quota take a trip get bent
Take a head trip outta hookah puff for days fuck a hurra
Take a chair drink a shoota brain boilin' off the Buddha
Bring on the dancin' girls with long curls
Interlaced with lotus blossoms of pink purple and pearl
Enjoy your feast of drink and slaughtered beast
On marble with linen creased and pieced with gold leaf
Your mood enhanced with wine song and dance 
And story of ancient bands with horns out they hands and
Ain't no doubt about it they let you puff on
Herbal stimulation have you gone like heron
And when you come inside their eyes open 
To the motion hopin to toke what I'm smokin'

Adjust your set perfect to get the head wreck
This here the next though not very complex
On text there'll be a test so check the context
Uno take the herb load up the slid
Numero dos take a deep breath and close your eyes
Tres spark fuego toke pull and hold
Until the weed stop expanding and your eyes explode
Then blow your hit out stretch out get the shit out
Float into Beijing holmes and flex your stidyle
Then smoke the bomba to steel drums and conga riffs
Blue seas from cool breeze and head trips
Full luscious lips and hips that's down dips
All spark but no one trips takin' outta turn hits
And when one burns out roll one we all say
Baby let the bells ring spark one for Beijing

Wow I bet you tore back now seeming pristine 
Geisha dancin' on a violet cloud
Jewel trees show where cool breeze blow
You can watch a waterfall flow where the mushroom grow
Everybody irie out on a level higher sit by the fire 
With pit bull and Bengal tiger
Ancient shogun exhibit what they know son
Metal be hurtin' no one in the land of no gun
Higher than high if you want to you can fly
See one time hold you shit high and drive by

To last breaths livin the high life avoiding wrecks
And passin the low life tests with stripes mic checks get
blessed
On any set Pyschos bring threat to upper deck
Authority reps fear bald heads and tatted necks
We earn the respect and get heat from the rest
So we deal with stress however we can 'till our deaths
Inner city district experiences we recite
If you can't relate to this well all right
Get you shit tight run little drugs in daylight
Despite the lifestyle you know you need to get right

This one goes out to big Duke and sick Jack
Sporty and them Street Platoon vatos sick syde's back
With the type of stuff they bumpin six-duce's and Cadillac's
The type of stuff that even if you ain't smokin it's all that

[Ives]
It's 'bout the most love the most hard most tatted
Most mind scarred most taken for granted
The most underated remain the most creative
Rip rhymes like Bobo bang drums the most faded
See this right here is for those who gon ride
Have my back no matter how many vatos is outside
And yes y'all we got a lot of em high
From the East to the West but all the Sick Syde
We down to help be	-Real keep the world stoned
That's why smoke spit up out boca and cloud zone
I had a dream that it help the ozone
And also relieve mi tension when not home

Chorus

Yo delinquentes man yo battle stations neva the fast lane
You know the stye you know the sound you know the name
My lyrics fly like projectiles in many styles
I've been making ends 'cause I had to since I was juvenile
Everyday angel everyday Angelino
And everyday I pray my family my homies and primos
Delinquent to what's tight like MC's to teflon
They been wrong my story's long still I'm singin my song
For two days in the Valley shows got rocked non-stop
Delinquente seleccion Sick Syde Realm Psyclone
The venue nicely packed the crowd got blown back
The chips was nicely stacked hats off to all them cats

Looks complicated, huh, but when the sound comes
Significant percussion feel rush crush the round drum
And keep in tempo with the cries of the Ancient
San Su Warrior takin out the plaintiff
This ill crush like skulls in Spain and running bulls
And they gon act like fools when the curtain pulls
This here for partyin' so let your ????? Bong slide
Cruise irie toxins through your head like a G-ride
I hang with macs and Alvarado maniacs
Who make Feria broke backs and Herb sacks
And this right here y'all will be known
As one of the most eloquent ever graced a mic phone
With hype tones my mind roam the ozone
When I'm on the stage known to flow zone
You got a pencil best put it in your pocket
Cause you'll need more than cheap blue ink to rock it

[Chorus 2X]
Cause in the House Of The Rising Drum they all come
You can vibe with the drum so strum or just hum
With a *BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRR* you best to duck run and hide
You know, yeah

[Ives]
Now I've seen how the world turns and how it functions
I'll be damned if I'm twiced burned before destruction
Cause I could never be that alligator that Albino
Sacrificial wino I got the shoes though with the ill flow
Then I stay two steps ahead three leagues above
The petty individuals sulkin in the masses
Bannin Latin accents then I drop bombs
Napalm square on the flesh and to make it more definitive you won't get rid of this
Your narrow minded attitude will make me rude
Making em capitulate in a civil fashion
I'm old fashion when it comes to body thrashin

Herb done job cool vibe you all high
Enter through the hale to zone of red eye
Get out your seat it's time to rock show

Delirious?,"Did I tell you it was wine when really it was water?
I walked upon the wine it went to my head and I faltered
I've tried to heal your bones I've tried to tell your future
Maybe I should just call up my friends
And play some music, be myself

Well I've been thinking about what do I and say
To climb my way down this ladder keep me
from flying away
And if there's a preacher here will you preach
the truth?
I want to know more about Jesus

All I want is you (all I want is you)
All I want is you now
All I want is you (all I want is you)
All I want is you

Did I tell you it was fine to come and
question nothing?
To look upon the sign as the answer to it all
Oh why do I feel poor?
Why do I feel nervous?
I think it's time to put on my God shoes
And do what I'm here for
Raise the flag again

Can I be free from the chains of my religion
They wrap around my head and blind my eyes of faith
And I feel dangerous 'cause I hunger for the truth

If there's a God, come rescue me,
Now here I stand, I'm saved by grace.

I will thank you for saving my soul,
For you've shown me the truth in your Word,
I will take up my cross and follow you,
Now I live for the glory of God.

Now we turn, to walk away,
From selfishness, the pride and hate,
And when we pass through stony ground,
We'll gladly walk upon our knees,
So we cry out, ""Come change us Lord,
Into a church that loves your Word""
We will return to knowing you,
With joy we walk beneath the Cross.

We will thankyou for saving our souls,

I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?

And never wished for Turkey

I was never at a party where
They honored Noel Coward

But social circles spin too fast for me

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate

Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls

Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Your father didn't like me at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rent this little nest, get a bit of rest

On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
Wed ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days grow short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year

It was a mess of good years",It Was a Very Good Year

Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me.

Della Reese,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do at the
End of a love affair? 

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud, when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely
And low as can be? 
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at atll!

So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best

It's worth its heartache in ransom

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""

Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories

Changin' by leaps and bounds
It started up in the bigger cities
And it's spread to the smaller towns

And the people began to smile at people
They’d never even seen
And when Jeremiah woke me up this morning
I was ready to live that dream

It’s a brand new day
It's brand new way
Yeah, it’s a brand new day
It's brand new way

Mother called father on the telephone
Because she was upset
She said, ""The boy left home, naked this mornin’
All he took was the TV set""

And then the sister picked up the extension
And she said, “He’s just doin’ his thing”
And then the father hung up on the mother
And all the children began to sing

It’s a brand new day
Doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

We gotta put our heads together
And see where we go from here
We gotta fight for what we believe in
'Cause there’s somethin' in the air

It’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Twenty million shadows stormin' at the gates
How can we be surprised
With the image of their fallen kings
Reflected in their eyes

And the twenty million tongues are shoutin’ now
It's only heard by a precious few
But the years of night are gonna pass forever
When the sun comes shinin’ through

On a a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
It’s a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Mama, it’s a brand new day
And you have had your way
Mama, how we're doin' in a brand new way
And you have had your way

It's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
We're gonna do it our way

After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so

Della Reese,"All of me, why not take all of me?
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I'll never use them

Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?

What a rare mood I'm in!

Della Reese,"Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues

Della Reese,"It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe.
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow.
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by.
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare,
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere.
Troubles fly away and life is easy go.
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know.

So sweet, cool and so fair

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits

Della Reese,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you at all.

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it,

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down.

This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'

Leaves me incomplete, you're here for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back.
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it.

And the only thing that you wanted to do
Was show your mum that you could play the piano
Ten years have passed
And the one thing that lasts
Is that same old song that we played along and made my mumma cry

I miss those days and I miss those ways
When I got lost in fantasies
In a cartoon land of mysteries
In a place you won't grow old in a place you won't feel cold and I'll sing

Da da da da da da da da da da da da
Seems I'm lost in my reflection
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
Find a star for my direction
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
For the little girl inside who won't just hide
Don't let me see mistakes and lies
Let me keep my faith and innocent eyes
My innocent eyes

Do you remember when you were fifteen?
And the kids at school called you a fool 'cause you took the chance to dream
In the time that's past and the one thing that lasts
Is that same old song that we played along and made my daddy cry

I miss those days and I miss those ways
When I got lost in fantasies
In a cartoon land of mysteries
In a place you won't grow old in a place you won't feel cold and I'll sing

Under the thoughts from within

Delta Goodrem,"I see you everyday
I guess we walk the same way
To wherever we're going
Every morning and every night
Do you smile to be polite
No way of knowing
I can't explain it
But I'm not complaining
If I'm happy or sad
If only we had

Just a minute longer
Than this
Just a little closer
Than this
I would get to know you
A little bit better
I could tell you
If only we had
Just a minute longer

A moment had arrived
It was just the right time
For conversation
And he asked me
What do you do?
What is your name?
Where are you from?
But before long
We're at the station

And I was so frustrated
In fact devastated
I feel happy but sad
If only we had

I wonder
I wonder what you think about
Do you think about me
Maybe I'm a dreamer
But I just believe
And I know what I see
Forever wishing
There would be another day
Oh if only we had
I don't care happy or sad",Longer
Delta Goodrem,"I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes
A little righteous and too proud
I just want to find a way to compromise
Cause I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers never giving in
But baby since you've gone I admit that I was wrong

All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie
How my going to be strong without you I need you by my side you
If we ever say we'll never be together and we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do? I'm lost without you
I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you

Everywhere I go I get so confused
You're the only thing that's on my mind

Oh my beds so cold at night and I miss you more each day
Only you can make it right no I'm not too proud to say

I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you

If I could only hold you now and make the pain just go away
Can't stop the tears from running down my face

All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie
How my going to be strong without you I need you by my side you

Delta Goodrem,"Amazing fairytale that had come true
Mr reliable romantic was you
Blinded misguided in the arms of love
Just 'cause it suited the both of us

Then it all went wrong
I'm the one to blame
Taking you for granted
In so many ways
When I look back now
How can I ever forget
You make me so happy
The day we met

How could something so magic
Become something so tragic
Right before my eyes
Two separate lives
Every second was a precious moment
Now I'm thinking about the path I've chosen
Wish I could un-make my big mistake
My big mistake

Communication had broken down
This situation was out of our hands
Well my hands
You've got to please understand
That I was too young, yes just
Too young for that
I guess it all went wrong
And I'm the one to blame
But what I would give to have you back again

The days the weeks the months
The years that we have wasted
I'm sorry
I still love you
I don't expect a call 'cause my apology's belated
I'm sorry
And I miss you all my life

How could something so magic
Become something so tragic

Delta Goodrem,"You mixed me up for someone
Who'd fall apart without you
Yeah you broke my heart for the first time
But I'll get over that too
It's hard to find the reasons
Who can see the rhyme?
I guess that we where seasons out of time
I guess you didn't know me

If you think love is blind
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines
Surprised that I caught you out
On every single time that you lied
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry
No not me, not I, not I, no not me, not I

The story goes on without you
And there's got to be another ending
But yeah you broke my heart it won't be the last time
But I'll get over them too
As a new door opens we close the ones behind
And if you search your soul I know you'll find
You never really knew me

If you think love is blind
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines
Surprised that I caught you out
On every single time that you lied
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry
No not me, not I, not I, not I, not I

All you said to me
All you promised me
All the mystery never did believe
No I never cry no I never not me not I

If you think love is blind
That I wouldn't see the floors between the lines
Surprised that I caught you out
On every single time that you lied
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry
No not I, I won't cry
No not me, not I, not I","Not Me, Not I"

Shadows bleeding through the light
Where a love once shined so bright
Came without a reason

Don't let go on us tonight

And I know that's not enough

But when I'm with you

If I had a chance
Oh, won't you let me

Treat me like a child
Throw your arms around me
Please protect me

Dazed and shattered how it hurts
Oh, haven't I always loved you

Delta Goodrem,"It's the last night on earth before the great divide
My hands are shaking time was never on our side
And there's no such thing as a beautiful goodbye
As an ordinary day I prayed for you a thousand times

It's never enough
No matter how many times I tried to tell to tell you this is love

If tomorrow never comes I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth

A penny for your thoughts
A picture so it lasts
Let's knock down the walls of immortality
Your fingers on my skin only you can hear my fear
Only you can help me heal
I see forever with you here

It's never enough no matter how many miles stand between us this is love

If tomorrow never comes I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth

It's never enough
No it's never enough
(it's never enough)
Ooh

The afterglow
The horizon line
The shadows fall
Will you still be mine
Will you still be mine
Will you still be mine I ask

I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first

A new chapter of my life 
Started the day

It could be my last.
My eyes were wide shut but
I hadn't given up 
Just thought I'd be walking

Out of the blue 
There I met you,
Showed me a life I can't see without you,
And there's just no way,
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me 
Nobody can renew me like you.

Can this be true!

I wasn't one for butterflies 
But you gave me love that I can't disguise.
There will be times when we're apart,
I want you to know you're in my heart,
Growing into a beautiful garden.

No emotions,
My whole body felt like ice.
Needed to feel,
That the sun would shine my way.
My world had turned to dust 
But I, had my faith and trust

You can answer in your time
Just don't freeze like a deer in the headlights

Sometimes it's the risk of getting hurt
That's beautiful and worse,
Is being numb feeling nothing at all

We gotta live and love not just survive

Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken
If you never bleed then you won't understand
Come pick me red roses with your bare hands

I'm standing right in front of you
But you don't know what to do
It's the fear of thorns that keeps you out of the garden

Be brave, be the fool, you've never been
'cause I'll be here to kiss you skin
Melt me on the path where love could begin

Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken
If you never bleed then you won't understand
Come pick me red roses with your bare hands

Make me feel I'm worth it
Don't love me with gloves on
Pick me roses roses with your bare hands
Make me feel I'm worth the scratches

Hearts that don't love can't be broken

Is just a waste of time

But you're not, not, not here anymore
I ring, ring, ring you’re every phone in my head
But I can't get through, the connection is dead

I want, want to tell you about the news today
But you wouldn't believe me, you’d laugh it away
There's a ghost standing at the foot of my bed
And it's you, it's you, it's you

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world
And there was nothing I could do to help you
And it's true today would be your birthday
It would've been your 27th year
And I miss you in the earth's atmosphere
I wish you were here

I go back, back, back in every memory of there
But the clock ticks over every minute we shared
On my knees begging for it not to be true
But it was you, it was you, it was you

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world
And there was nothing I could do to help you
And it's true today would be your birthday
It would've been your 27th year
And I miss you in the earth's atmosphere
I wish you were here

Instead of just in my dreams and in my imagination
Confusing me completely from another dimension
Can you see the beauty from a new beginning somewhere
Cause I feel like I won't repair with time

It was you, it was you, it was you

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world

It's still early, it's still more than I should
I'm off to Carolina
I'm gonna wear my mama’s boots
We may be parted, but that don't cut us at the roots

'Cause in the morning, in the morning
Sometimes I think about the way you held me
In the morning, in the morning
Sometimes I think about the way you held me

It's colder in November
The leaves are turning on the limbs
The color’s brightest just before the branches thin
And, yes, I still remember
But I am trying to begin
I met a new love and I’m growing into him

But in the morning, in the morning
Sometimes I think about the way you held me
In the morning, in the morning
Sometimes I think about the way you held me

I see a new flag rising on an old flagpole
A shotgun fired in the firing hole
I’ll let the snow keep falling till my world is white
I don’t need your hand tonight

But in the morning, in the morning
Sometimes I think about the way you held me",Holding On To Good
Delta Rae,"If I loved you, life would be easy
There'd be no truth that I'd be scared of
I could walk through every valley
And you'd light me with all of your love
But I don't love you, not like I want to
I don't love you and that makes it hard
And every morning, I see how you watch me
And each night I know you feel it and it just breaks your heart
You'd make good money and come home early
And you'd kiss me and hold me each night
We would have children and they would be so beautiful
And we'd raise them and all would be right
But I don't love you, not like you need it
I don't love you, good as you are
And when I kiss you, I know that you can feel it
And I see it in your eyes, and it just breaks my heart
I wish to God I could change it, darling
Could make you the one
I will always have these regrets and wonder
What else I could have done
I will
'Cause if I loved you, I could be happy
I would make you the light of my world
I wouldn't wait, love, I'd marry you tomorrow
And we'd make love and I'd be your girl
But I don't love you, much as I want to
I don't love you, no, it would be a lie
And you deserve love, you're better than a good day
And you'll find it, but just not in my eyes
'Cause it ain't here love, no
And it just breaks my heart",If I Loved You
Delta Rae,"So far from where I started
And so far from where I want to be
The towers I watched when I was young
Are not as tall as I once believed

And this heart grows tired

Is there anyone out there?

I am the son
Of a lost country, of a new world
And we’re born to run and we never look back

Children born tomorrow
May never know the language we speak
The wisdom that they borrow
Will hint at something buried too deep

Who will save us when the wrong ones have won?

Delta Rae,"Oh, oh. I found a good woman, I found a job that pays.
The tide comes in, I watch it all wash away.
But I'm keeping it steady, that's just how I was raised

And this heart grows tired

But I’m keeping it steady, that’s just how I was raised

'Cause the devil’s in the details and he’s taking his toll
Sending good men down the foot trails of some lost lonely souls

And I say oh, oh
Rain don’t change the sun
Jealous is the night when the morning comes
But it always comes

So I’m working the graveyard, I don’t sleep till it’s light
Ain’t calling in favors, I can’t swallow my pride
And the bank’s on a mission, they want to read me my rights
But they ever show up around here, they’re going to be in for a fight

'Cause the devil’s in my hometown and I ain’t telling him no
'Cause it’s my family, it’s my love now, that I’m scared to let go

And I say oh, oh
Rain don’t change the sun
Jealous is the night when the morning comes
But it always comes

Followed the track of my needle
Tried to be good to my people
So why’s there no peace?
No break no relief

Can I be blamed if I’m angry?
Can I be saved if I’m barely clinging to hope?
I’m clinging to hope

When I say oh, oh
Rain don’t change the sun
Jealous is the night when the morning comes
But it always comes

It always rains down on us
And like an old dog lying by a new gravestone
It’s still our home
It’s still our home

With the children of soldiers, the children of slaves

Foxes and hounds
Our souls are bound
To older ground

Fell in love with a girl who’s found love before
In the hands and the hearts of the people she wore
She’s all that I see, but there’s things in between
The fractures and fissures of all of the pictures we leave

They linger ’round
Foxes and hounds
They’re with me now
Can’t lay them down

And I feel it all around, I’m surrounded
And I feel it all around, I’m surrounded
And I feel it all around, I’m surrounded by ghosts

So we keep them at home, the secrets and bones
The voices we hear so we’re never alone
They tease and they taunt, comfort and haunt
My mother and father and so many I’ll never know

Tried to say it's not my problem, couldn't happen to my friends
But the truth is they're my brothers, and they're my countrymen
And if we lose our better angels, we won't get them back again

Delta Spirit,"There's no place to lay my dead
When I can't stay awake
The growth I need is fettered with fear
My heels dug in my place

Keep your heart clasped into your hands
Your family just knows half of where you've been

The Indian summer is better than nothing
Burn the sun in my skin
Bleeding bells of inner guilt
Salvation rays are thin

I say to myself you don't need anyone
This world is fucked just as you have become

I stand as a man who's seen many things
My youth has made me strong
I see the fraught of the words I have said
Got nothing for anyone

The words that I speak are like the clinging hell
The songs that I sing's been poisoning your well

Hands in my pockets and down on my knees
I beg for will to change
I've spun around from this wheel that I'm in
In one week I'll be the same

Is too small for you

His drugs that he hides
You can see in his veins

You staring at me
What are you doing there?

Get up, lay down your crown
What are you doing now?

And you have nothing left to lose
Why don't you just roll away
That stone that's locked you up?

When your pattern is full
And it feels like there's no place to land
When will you all run out of gas?
Yeah, it happened so fast
Leaving town for sell to pal

I recall only nights that we built
With our hands and feet, making peace
With the voice in our head
That ghost just stop
Won't lie dead, it just bleeds

Let the prophet rebound
Let his riddle rub on to my pride
I'm just too hollow inside
Let it echo in time just to get it
Through my head and mouth

Through the gorgeous light of the sun
And which I could never outrun
Even if my perdition were just in front

The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light

The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light

There is eyes within the dirt
Under the nails of a working man

We may act different in some ways
But we still grouped together like a fuckin' survey

I'm trapped in a bottle

Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens
I smoke herb and rock a turban

Simple minded people always point the finger
To bring it to a close as if life is their role, their path
When all paths are intersections
It all depends on the persons perception
When I'm mad as fuck you get shot
And to some it's bad luck
I believe you held something back for too long
It grew strong
And energy got its own will
And people think they make music still
But music is there with out you or me we just manipulate
For better or worse so let it situate
I get to make records and dough
Paid out the ass hole
And still seen as another face on the totem pole
Conquer, my sponsors are monsters
And everybody thinks that I owe them one
I'm glad I love music and life 
Cause it's easy to see the pain and strife and end it all tonight

I did the knowledge on the true purpose
Providing abbreviated facts to keep the planet in virtue
Controlling times, size, and bias

About your boy Deltron Zero, your hero
In three thousand thirty
We ain't in the clear though
We was near toast, doing too much, who to trust
In a land so scandalous and grand?
Even the President got his hand in the contraband
They done control the band of information
Leading to education to a brainwaves pulsatin'
They said ""Fuck the Environment!""
For so long the environment said ""Fuck y'all""

Full scale chaos, reckless abandon
Cats will sell they, hand for a handgun
Follow your commander, though you can't stand him
No plannin', wild and dangerous
Anger just permeate, so we learn to take
Hostility with a grain of salt
And step out the way, cause it ain't our fault

Whatever's left is left for the fiends
But you'd better not mess with the team

They ain't God, but their ways is pompous
Thinking they can stomp us with troops and contras

Our tiny planet was continuously shrouded in darkness
From greed and anarchic conquest
The final operation, based ideas and proposals
Involving privateers, serving low blows to constellation patrol
Just to overthrow and obtain supplies for the side that they ride for
Privateer raids on the core system while the whole planet under war conditions
Taking more victims
Then a mutiny taking over government control in attempts to secure a new republic
What became of it?
Planet wide destruction
Constant weapon fire crushing any production
Of advancements of science
Technology to ease life's difficulty
Every tax dollar went to sweep crime
Off the street but the law would cheat each time
So operations backfire defeating the design
Seems like a leap in time, back to simpler days
Where technological advances were minimal
Whoever survived were thrust into dimmer days
Every portion of the land decimated in a blaze
Law and order fractured

And abandoned shacks and crack houses with rats out in the clear open

Now we gotta pull straws, figure out a plan

Of ragtag renegades, looking for living grenades

High off of Nitro 9

No scruples
No rules so

Not control anyway

That's not hard to see
More cars than trees
Or more like lumps of metal

Nuclear fallout crawls out
And sometimes blinds people, leaving them with no sight
No rights, muggers in broad day
Similar to the ancient fables of the wild west
Or maybe just a trial or test
For humans who thought they were superior and more than houses of flesh

The seasons continue to pass. Spring became summer.
Fall dimmed into the winter's cold light

Society continued to erode as the people began to collapse
under the weight of economic despair

10 years had elapsed
since there had even been a blip of information
on the whereabouts of the mythical duo

Occasionally a story would be heard
a rumor from an unreliable source in a bar, or some place like that

Inevitably, it would be discounted as drunken hearsay
much like Area 51 or the Loch Ness Monster
until they were eventually proven to be true, of course

One by one the banks began to collapse again.
Politicians were running out of flocks to fleece.
The middle class had faded into irrelevance.
Anarchy had started to peek its head out

Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

And I got that torch, so you know that I blast metal
If you went away, we steppin' on you like a gas pedal
And I got that linen squeeze so I grip my pipe tight
Most of these niggas mad cause we shinin' like some bright lights

Wit them 2's that I'm close 2
Why niggaz wanna shine
Wanna be in my position

And leave it hard 4 the competition
I'm on a mission tryna get it
'cause a nigga got to eat
Talk shit on these tracks

Ever holding my hand
Never again
Please don't forget
Don't forget

We had it all
We were just about to fall
Even more in love
Than we were before
I won't forget
I won't forget
About us

But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it

But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it

At all

And at last
All the pictures have been burned
And all the past
Is just a lesson that we've learned
I won't forget
Please don't forget about us

But somewhere we went wrong
Our love is like a song
But you won't sing along
You've forgotten
About us
Don't forget",Don't Forget

You make me melt with your voice

Just to find that I'm your seventh choice
And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it be best if you get lost
Cause you know you'll never change

Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games in my mind
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time
And don't say its forever
And don't play cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught

You promise me all of your time
I guess I'm not they only one
The thing its my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one or I'm gone

And don't say its forever
And don't play cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught

No don't try to get me back
I wont forget about our past
I never had the guts to leave
Now your making it
Now your making it much easier for me to see

And don't say that you sorry
Your breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start now it's time to get lost

Never would've said forever
If we knew it ends so fast
Why did you say I love you
If you knew that it wouldn't last?

If love were medication 'cause it only causes pain,
You won't go to the doctor cause his calling you insane,
Your lost even when your going the right way,
You mean the world to me even though you might be crazy,
And you said we wouldn't make it, but look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say, made me fall harder each day.
Your a train wreck, but I wouldn't love you if you changed.

Yeah

I shook your hand and you pulled it right away,
Yeah,
You asked me to dance, instead I said no way.
Inside I was dying, to give it a try, you beg me so I stay.
I knew you were different from the way I caved;

And you said we wouldn't make it,
But look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say you make me fall harder each day,
You're a trainwreck,
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh! Oh yeah!

We are so different,
But opposites attract,
So my hope kept growing,
And that I never looked back,
You're one of a kind!
No one can change this heart of mine.
Oh!

And you said we wouldn't make it,
But look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say you make me fall harder each day,
You're a trainwreck,
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh! Oh yeah!

One more thing I thought I'd share with something special,
I'm falling like I've never fell before,
It's funny you said we'd never make it, and but look how far we've come,
You're a train wreck,
But with you, I'm in love.",Trainwreck
Demi Lovato,"She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone to show her,
Who she could be.
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
And I needed you to believe

You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
You showed me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.

She was scared of it all, watching from far away.
She was given a role, never knew just when to play.
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the throne
You give me strength to find hope.

You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
You showed me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.

She was scared
Unprepared.
Lost in the dark.
Falling apart,
I can survive,
With you by my side.
We're gonna be alright.
This is what happens when two worlds collide.

You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.

Kiss me quick but make it last
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye

Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass but don't let go
But tonight I could fall too soon into this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me

See this heart won't settle down
Like a child running scared from a clown
I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams just when I look at you

Run far away so I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
But I can't get my hopes too high
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me

Now you see why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart without care
So here I go
It's what I feel
For the first time in my life I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing

I tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out
I knew what you were thinkin' before you'd say it aloud

Don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not even breaking
You're not worth the time that this is taking

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie

Every time you lie
Every time you lie

I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place
Less trashier, much classier then who you prove to be
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me, oh no

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie

At night awake
I won't be sleeping 'til morning breaks
That's the price you pay, for your mistakes
Goodbye to dreaming

So don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes

Can't believe that I put up with all this pain
I've been used and I was choking on the promise
I would never fall again

I used to sing to your twisted symphony
The words that had me trapped inside your misery
But now I know
The reason why I couldn't breathe

Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door
Cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, I don't care what you say
Cause all I really, all I really want
Is everything you're not

Everything you're not not not

Your darkness was my weakness but it turns out
That it only went so deep
A meaningless diversion that is all that you
Ever meant to me

And I am done with your twisted symphony
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe

Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door
Cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, I don't care what you say
Cause all I really, all I really want
Is everything you're not

I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen
I need respect, I need love
Nothing in between

I will not spell it out for you if you can't see
Cause you're not worthy, you don't deserve me
A now I'm gone

Everything you're not, not, not
Everything you're not, not, not

Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door
Cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, I don't care what you say
Cause all I really, all I really want

Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again",Everything You're Not

And all the names that brought us here
Simply fade away

And lead you to the water
I can't make you feel
What you don't feel but you know you wanna
Find out how to crack me

Underneath the surface
There so much you need to know
And you might feel like your drowning
And that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses
Tell me what your gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite

Got dynamite?

I can't paint this picture
Just so you can hang it

I can't wait
For you to understand
If you just don't get it

I hope you're standing right in front of me
Where my past lies all around

And make the walls come crashing down

Demi Lovato,"I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
And ignore all your messages

I tell everyone we are through
'Cause I'm so much better without you
But it's just another pretty lie
Cause I break down

Every time you come around
Oh oh oh oh

So how did you get here
Under my skin?
I swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you
Is so addictive
We're falling together
You'd think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go go go again

You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Every time that you look at me

You only hear half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye
But it's no use

Can't be with or without you
O oh o oh

So how did you get here
Under my skin?
I swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you
Is so addictive
We're falling together
You'd think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go go go again

Oh
And again (and again)
And again (and again)
And again

I threw all of your stuff away
And I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart

It's driving me crazy
It's like we stopped breathing in this room

We're both the last to be leaving
I know what you're thinking
I wish you'd make your move

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence finally

It's like you know where I'm going
You follow me home
But I never invite you inside

I see what you're not showing
I got you alone but
The air is so still it's weird

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence finally

Don't stop don't stop
Telling me goodnight
Just promise you'll kiss me goodbye
What's taking so long

Don't tell me you're not goin' try
The tensions building in my mind
I want to scream and I know why

It's much too quiet in here

Why can't we break this silence finally

Make it all go away

Just prove that there is nothing left to try
'Cause the truth 
I'd rather we'd just both deny

You kiss me with those open eyes

It's no surprise, to you
But I've got something left to say

And in your words I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see
What's wrong for me

I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if you're gonna get away with this
You're not sorry

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you done
You're losing me
Is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo

You sing to me
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key
If your life is such a mystery
Why don't you just stick to acting
Oh

Here we go again
You couldn't find my number until when
You thought that you could get to my best friend
Without a script your game is lacking

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you done
You're losing me
Is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo

I'd rather go to a party alone
Than have to walk around with you on my arm
Now that I'm better to admit that we're done
Good luck trying to find me

California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down
We sing along
To our favorite song
Nothing could go wrong

Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything
Could tear us apart
I won't let you break my heart

Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
You cant tell me lies don't even try
Cause this is goodbye

Goodbye

Caught you from the corner of my eye
You smiled at a girl while passing by
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
I know what's going on
And it didn't take me long

It wasn't hard to read between the lines
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine
Nothing left for you to do or say
Now I'm on my way
Now it's too late

Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
You cant tell me lies don't even try
Cause this is goodbye

Say goodbye to broken promises
Time to face your carelessness
Don't bore me with apologies
And come crawling back on your knees

You got nothin' on me
You got nothin' on me
You got nothin' on me

I know who you are
Now I see I should have known it from the start

You cant tell me lies, don't even try

Chances that you're burning through.

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye

Just follow the glow yeah
It won't be long
Just know that you're not alone

I tried to build the walls
To keep you safe when I'm not around
But as soon as I'm away from you
You say they come tumbling down
But it's not about the time
That we don't get to spend together
It's about how strong our love is
When I'm gone and it feels like forever

My love's like a star yeah
You can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine
And remember I'm always near
If you see a comet
Baby I'm on it
Making my way back home
Just follow the glow yeah
It won't be long
Just know that you're not alone

You say that time away makes your heart grow out
But I can stay just to prove you wrong
Oh look at how far we've come
Don't you know
Don't know that you're the one

My love's like a star yeah
You can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine

‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough

When I don’t care
I can play ‘em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous
That I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow, but I cover up

They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So scared I’ll take off in a run
I’m flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m

Each name reminds me of a smile,
A part of me I left behind,
The times I said goodbye,
The way love always dies,
But then again, I loved so many times.

Each name reminds me of a song,
The nights that fell apart at dawn,
When I had more to give than just a life to live,
But then again, I've had my share and even more.

The sound of every first hello,
The words I didn't know,
I learned with time the rhymes to every line.
And when I think of all the names,
The tender games I played,
I wonder if they still remember mine.

Each name reminds me of the past,
The memories that didn't last,
The one that counted more 
than all I had before,
That went away one day to let me love again.

Traces of illusion ,distant memories
Haste in your conclusion
Things that use to be
Silence grew between us
Then became a friend
All it left between us
All it left between us
Slowly turned to sand

I can try again this time
It would be in vain
Now that we know every line
We know how it ends
The storm is drawing near and just
This once I’ll go before it starts to rain
The words that must be said this once
I can’t go through it all again

Moments of confusion
Longer every time
Each in our reclusion
What’s there left to hide

Nothing to forget
Nothing to remember
Nothing to regret

Inside the world that is mine

With you there is no emptiness of time

Shadows of a thousand faces keep on turning in your mind,
Forgotten names and places never really left behind.
Is it here imagination seeking shelter from the rain,
or a long self conversation once again.

Shadows never point a finger at the things you say or do,
silently they seem to linger anywhere you may run to.
Sharing every joy or torment, every laughter or despair,
facing you at any moment if you dare.

Gentle hearts that once surrendered what you didn't understand,
conquest of the night that ended holding you with trembling hands.
In a book a fall leaf-clover marks the day you said hello,
till she found that it was over long ago.
Little things have lost their meaning leaving only emptiness,
tender words and simple feelings never eased your hungriness.
Yesterdays remain so certain and tomorrow’s round the bend,
can you read the line that darkens on your hand.

Both ends of a candle burning shine so brightly for a while,
wrinkles of a life reflecting in your smile.

silently they seem to linger anywhere you may run to.

Demis Roussos,"SOMEDAY SOMEWHERE



Someday, Somewhere
You said hello and walked into my life
Painted all my words in blue
Made my life a dream come true
Someday, Somewhere
I held your hand and suddenly I knew
That your love
Could show the way
To my rainbow's end


You gave my heart eternity 
Chained my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a symphony
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday, Somewhere
You said hello and walked into my life
all so unexpectedly
all so very tenderly
I held your hand and suddenly I knew
That your love 
Could show the way
To my rainbow's end

You gave my heart a song to sing
Chained my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a melody
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday, Somewhere
Our song went by and left us standing there
Silently I walked away
Leaving me with yesterdays
Someday, Somewhere
We'll meet again and we'll pretend in vain
Trying to convince ourselves our love was just a game game game …",Someday Somewhere
Demis Roussos,"When you lie close to me ,my heart is a flame
just the brush of your lips and I call out your name
Then I rest in your arms and I know that you are true
I thank god for your love and the mistery of you

You can change like the wind, you are never the same
You don’t know what I do, you think life is a game
I can act like a fool and I very often do
But you still understand that’s the mystery of you
We will be forever wi'll go on and on
we will be together when forever has gone
we will be forever we'll go on and on
we will be together when forever has gone
When I'm weak you are strong when I fall you go on
you'll still be with me when my other friends have gone
yet you cry like a child and that breaks me in two
you are all things to me that's the mystery of you
You can change like the wind, you are never the same
You don’t know what I do, you think life is a game
I can act like a fool and I very often do
But you still understand that’s the mystery of you
we will be forever we'll go on and on
we will be together when forever has gone
we will be forever we'll go on and on
we will be together when forever has gone",When Forever Has Gone

I give you des chansons d'amour,
from ancient worlds and old folklore,
with memories and sound of ma musique.
Just walk beside me hand in hand,
to my Mediterranean land,
listen to the voice of ma musique.

I saw you smiling silently my way,
your eyes reflecting sunlight in my heart,
you look so happy, care-free and so gay,
so closed to me and yet so far apart,

And then rearrange somehow.

Force it out, bring it through, pass it down, make it new.

Drown, you're just a trace of what I used to be

Waging the battle for appreciation you'll never win
Behold the army that will harken with open souls
A tiny voice of pester, softer than the drop of a pin
And so naive in thinking you were the source you told
I was composing the beginning before you had begun
Where did you sharpen such a tongue
For the sound you spill
I want the honor for the favor that I've already won
Without the ignorant deduction
That you reveal

Give me the pain of something real
No empty notion, I want to see the pressure rising
Give in a way that I can feel
When you disgrace me I want to see your eyes burn

Drown, you're just a trace of what I used to be

You wrote the words you couldn't

I read the thoughts you never
Questioned would show your face
If confrontation were to wake
And rear it's ugly head
I get the feeling you'd be wanting it all erased
This simple gossip is your only definition in life
And what a vacant purpose, taking it to your grave
There is no threat of loss in hearing the slant you cry
Oh, what a fool to think you fell
On the mass you crave

Fall into the flood of your awakening.

I see your life and death reduce into a product line
It's not enough to see you speaking through the blindest of eyes
The same dead, cold breath is reducing mine
I can't see why
You're not a saint, you're a thief
You can't deny
It's all a ploy underneath.

All I've seen (you better learn to keep your face under the dark)
All I need (wake up and feel the blood escape your heart)

I can't breathe (for every soul you nauseate with what you say)

You've brought this verdict on yourself (before we ever had a chance)
I hope you cry for the one's you've lost.
You built this burden when you fell (you know we never took a glance)
I hope it's worth all the blood it cost.

It's been a long way back from the dissipated path
Only half way through, say goodbye and take a breath
And when the end shines new with the burn of nothing left
I'll give you one last chance to say you're done and give it back.
I won't agree.
Your remedy is a joke.
I can't believe.
That you can breathe and not choke.

(CHORUS)

Peddle your faith to the blind.
And cheapen the love that you feel so painful.
Pushing the guilt through yourself.
And suffer the mold of a prime example.

Demon Hunter,"In the never-ending circle
Where the powerless meet
There grows a struggle from the burden
Of sustaining defeat
In the face of every coward
Lies the blindest of hate
And in the eyes of a sharpened image of the damage they made
You look at me to bear the burden of the suffering past 
It wasn't me behind the veil of a heartless mask
And where were you the day that everybody cursed your name?
You were the distant voice of pride
That never stood the shame

And the fist of the frail will bring gun
The loudest of guns provoke bombs

And in the midst of moving foward we have given the right
To let the wolves attack the sheep and bury guilt inside
I won't forget the twisted picture of the filth that we were 
Or disregard the faded voices of the people we hurt
But I was never pulling triggers or degrading your face

My life fell out of my hands and into
This hole where everything's cold
I lose the feeling of guilt. There's
Nothing inside, my innocence died.
And now the emptiness grows, it's 
Bringing me down and taking my crown
I've seen where everything's dark.
It's here in my soul, I'm losing control.

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me for every thorn I've driven in.

Within these walls you'll see
Alone in here - the end.

Before my very last day I'm making it stop.
I'm turning it off.
I'll fight the feeling I have until everything's
Gone. Resistance has won
Now time is healing these wounds and
You are still here releasing my fear
My life fell out of my hands. They
Took it away, I'm taking it back.

[Chorus]

And everyday I feel like this weight's 
Constantly dragging me down
Broken for the last time (Never get the best of me, won't get the best of me)
I've got a heart of steel, but your words are
Constantly bringing me down.
I'm open for the first time (Never get the best of me, won't' get the best of me)

I've had all my life to fall in place
I watch all my past in right decay
And with every step that shames my face
I see all my pieces catch ablaze

[Chorus]
The pain is fading, now you're leaving me alone.
I can't stop bleeding, I'm depleting on my own

I can't bury every form I've seen
The hollow pieces of perfection are embedded in me
And with every step the walls give way
And in the shadow of deceit I can see you fade
I've seen all those dreams we try to hide
And the sound of honesty's reply
But I'm not that man you've seen inside
He was born so pure but then he died

[Chorus]

With every word I breathe out
I feel it escaping from my soul
With every thought created

I've got to find a way to stop before it starts.
Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.
I never thought it something everyone could see.
And it kills within me.

I won't be erased.

It's in my head, I can't forget what you once said.
The words I read, the fractured soul that I can't mend.
Right here with me, killing the void I used to be.
Remembering through fading sparks of memory.

To keep the lungs from..

Caving.

Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.

Before we tear this open

Giving my weight in hate until the neck bends

Falling into this cell that you've opened
Hollow as all these faces around me

You will find no clarity in me
I am the deceased, the least, the solitude
Failing every face I try to be.

I'm not your progress, the pay of your pains
I'm stabbing the questions for answers I can't face
I'm losing the battle and finding no life to retrace.

I built this anguish with my own hands
I felt the burn inside with my heart.
I built this anguish with my own hands
I watched our faces fall apart.

I felt the tears of all your angels, so cold.
I saw the fall of all your children, I'm so cold.

We are just a fraction of the poison living in this place
How can we answer with a straight face?
Who are you in gauging every standard you
Would have us chase?
Are we alone to run the last race?
We are all the weak, the meek, the innocent
Kissing every fault that we disgrace
We are of the worst, the cursed, the desolate
Leaving every hope that we embrace.

You turn your eyes to me in hope of my decline
Pointing your blame as I faltered on that line
We saw your slander when you pulled it off the shelf

I need a heart that carries on through the pain
When the walls start collapsing again

Wash over the skin you've broken

When every breath is a dying wish
It's harder to follow the point of this

This broken place that I call my home
Is deep in the sorrow that I have sewn
And I can't erase what is in my heart
I wanted to finish before it starts

My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red

And open my fate to the darkened sky

I've been fading away
I've been waiting on a call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waist
Every sorrow of the soul will reap my name
When I cease to exist

So, now I've come to a final sleep
I pray that forgiveness is mine to keep
I know it's hard to forgive this man
Driving the failure into your hands

My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red

And it's open my fate to the darkened sky

I've been fading away
I've been waiting on a call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waist
Every sorrow of the soul will reap my name
When I cease to exist
When I cease to exist

I've been fading away
I've been waiting on a call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waist
Every sorrow of the soul will reap my name
When I cease to exist

I've been waiting on a call to reach my veins

False in every possible way
Your god is still the powerless creation you will lose your hope in

Dead is the way you stake your life on
The oblivious belief
What a waste to sell your spirit for

Lay upon the bed you made
Your word is not the legacy of truth that you would bet your life on

And tremble in the wake of your conviction as you put your life on

Run away from the hollow cries, to the shelter of release

How low to sink to the depths of their frame of mind

I've kept it hidden and safe
Fulfill the god's desire
To hold their waning flame
A sacred life

And what have started long ago
Is heading towards the end
There's no easy way out
There's blood on my hands
But I am sure in the end
I will prove I was right

Runes of a long forgotten time
Ancient spells in endless rhymes
Soon the other world appears
Roam to the ghostly river Rhine
Leave the misty shades behind
I can feel I'm getting near

By the ancient spirits' rites
The old ghosts proclaim their rights
Still they're lost in time

Lost in time
I wonder why they're lost in time
Lost in time

The curse lives on
Still chasing me
It's always been there by my side
And it won't let me out
A treacherous leaf
And a secret unsealed
It will cause deadly wounds

Roam to the ghostly realms at nights
To cleanse the dark shades of my night
Leave the mortal world behind
Float to the endless streams of time
An eternal ray of light
Leave my mortal shape behind

Lost in time
I wonder why they're lost in time
Lost in time

Demons & Wizards,"Sad voices they're calling
Our precious girl she can't be gone
How bitter this morning
When daddy's darling
Went out and started her day

Wasn't there a dream last night
Like a spring never ending
Still the water runs clear
Through my mind
On the field I can see a fiddler
The fiddler on the green and the sad boy
I took him too early
Would you mind
Would you mind
Would you mind
If I take you

To be with you
To be with you
To be with you
To be with you

The sun seemed bright
The air was clear
The air was clear
A trick of light
Turned red into green
She saw the light
Her face was pale
Her body smashed
Her beauty's gone

Isn't it a shame
The reaper said
He is quite alone here
And still waiting for you
Oh I really did fail for the first time
Spoke the fiddler, poor old fiddler
The fiddler on the green
The fiddler on the green
It would be niceâ?¦

Call me Messiah - I am god
A true lord but alone
Call me a liar - oh I won't deny
That I'm mad

Am I evil am I good
Mad existence, faith and greed

The universe a gallows Pole
Extinction of the living soul

Towards the sun we'll keep moving
Fate I hold in hand
Dancing 'til the end
I am condemned
Oh I bring all mankind's end
The end
Oh I've seen
All life die

A shattered heart an empty soul
Just one false move and it took its toll
The rising of an evil seed
I can't describe the pain I feel
Outside it's dark inside it's cold
The sun still shines bright
But its time is short

Endless stairs
A guiding light
That once was warm
But now it's bitter cold

It's freezing hearts
It's freezing souls

It pretends to be alive

Collapse of the mother
All will die
The void it frightens me
I've faced the demon
And he dwells inside

And when I laugh it's tears I hid
And when I cry it's joy inside
A foul disease has stained the land
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom
And when I cry it's joy inside
A wicked smile for all the tears I hide
It hurts to hold all the pain I feel
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom

Still we are one, you and I
Realize, I did what you wanted me to

The lack of pure souls and the fading light

Then came the night 
Cruel nothingness

Thus heaven denies
Refused for all times

Rotten flesh keeps burning

Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings,
Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawnlight smiles on your leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines.
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the stations.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out felt my own need just beginning.
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
I'll wait for you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation from the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
