Ferlin Husky,"Don't your conscience ever bother you every time you hear my name
Well you should go somewhere hide your face and hang your head in shame
Yes someone came along and took my place and you gave me all the blame
You should go somewhere and hide your little face and hang your head in shame
Yes someone came along and took my place and you gave me all the blame
Oh you should go somewhere and hide your little face and hang your head in shame
And hang your head in shame",Hang Your Head in Shame
Ferlin Husky,"Sitting alone in an old rockin' chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
Her hands were caloused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I've thought of angels as I saw her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I look at her and I think what a shame
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same
And I think of angels as I see her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair",Rockin' Alone in an Old Rockin' Chair
Ferlin Husky,"In a vine covered shack in the mountains bravely fighting the battle of time
There's a dear one who's weathered life's sorrow it's that silver haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches dear old daddy I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face and bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone to that silver haired daddy of mine
I know it's too late dear old daddy to repay for the heartaches and cares
My dear mother is waiting in heaven just to comfort and solace you there
If I could recall all the heartaches",That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine
Ferlin Husky,"AMONG MY SOUVENIRS
WRITERS HORATIO NICHOLS, EDGAR LESLIE

There's nothing left for me of days that used to be There's just a memory among my souvenirs Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two I see a rose from you among my souvenirs A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest And though they do their best to give me consolation I count them all apart and as the teardrops start I find a broken heart among my souvenirs I count them all apart and as the teardrops start I find a broken heart among my souvenirs



",Among My Souvenirs
Ferlin Husky,"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes

Gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me

Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
Gigolo and gigolette

Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
For I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigolette

Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams",The Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Ferlin Husky,"All alone I am yearning to be with you again 
For a spark is still burning, it will ever remain 
But I'm yearning in vain 
The moon is high, the sky is blue 
And here am I, but where are you? 
A night like this was meant for two 
And I am here, but where are you? 
Have you forgotten the night that we met? 
With so much to remember 
How could you forget? 
The dreams I dream have yet to come true 
My dreams and I are here, but where are you?",But Where Are You?
Ferlin Husky,"I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN
WRITER RUTH LOWE

I'll never smile again Until I smile at you I'll never laugh again What good would it do? For tears would fill my eyes My heart would realize That our romance is through I'll never love again I'm so in love with you I'll never thrill again To somebody new Within my heart I know I will never start To smile again Until I smile at you



",I'll Never Smile Again
Ferlin Husky,"I can't show my face can't go anyplace people stop and stare it's so hard to bear
Everybody knows you left me it's the talk of the town
Every time we meet my heart skips a beat we don't stop to speak know it's just a week
Everybody knows you left me uhm it's the talk of the town
We send our invitations to friends and relations advancing our wedding day
Friends and our relations gave congratulations how can you face that what can you say

Ferlin Husky,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",Me and My Shadow

OUT IN THE COLD AGAIN
WRITERS RUBE BLOOM, TED KOEHLER


(Out in the cold) The song that you sang so sweetly You called it our love refrain It's gone and I'm left completely Out in the cold again I dreamed that our love would linger But just memories remain As I gaze at that ringless finger Out in the cold again True it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new But deep down inside my whole world depended on you I wanted your arms around me To shelter me from the rain But now I'm back where you found me Out in the cold again (True it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new) (But deep down inside my whole world depended on you) I wanted your arms around me To shelter me from the rain But now I'm back where you found me Out in the cold again Out in the cold



",Out in the Cold Again
Ferlin Husky,"I lost the sunshine and roses I lost the heavens of blue
I lost the beautiful rainbow I lost the morning dew
I lost the angel who gave me summer the whole winter through
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness when I lost you
I lost the sweet thing who gave me summer the whole winter through
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness when I lost you",When I Lost You
Ferlin Husky,"Afraid to tell you how much I care.
Afraid I'll need you and you won't be there.
I'd love to take you in to my heart.
But something tells me we would only part.
I loved and lost just one love ago.
I paid the cost and it hurt me so.
A heart gets careless when vows are made.
I want to love you but I'm so afraid",Afraid
Ferlin Husky,"Blues in my heart oh how it aches nobody knows the sorrow it takes
I should have known right from the start you'd leave me with these blues in my heart

Ferlin Husky,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Ferlin Husky,"No one will ever know my heart is breaking although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling you've hurt me but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you then no one will ever know the truth but me
I'll tell them I've found true love with another",No One Will Ever Know
Ferlin Husky,"Some people run some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light and some wrapped in fearful black
Some people never get some never give some people never die and some never live

Some folks treat me mean some treat me kind
Most folks just go their way and don't pay me any mind
Time oh good good time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go

Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold and sometimes it's hot

Nothing but blues skies do I see

Ferlin Husky,"Love is the sweetest thing
What else on earth could ever bring
Such happiness to ev'rything
As love's old story.
Love is the strangest thing
No song of birds upon the wing
Shall in our hearts more sweetly sing
Than love's old story.
Whatever heart may desire
Whatever fate may send
This is the tale that never will tire.
This is the song without end.
Love is the greatest thing
The oldest yet, the latest thing
I only hope that fate may bring
Love's story to you.",Love Is the Sweetest Thing
Ferlin Husky,"Chorus: You ought to see deacon Jones When he rattles the bones, Old parson Brown foolin' 'roun like a clown, Aunt Jemima who is past eighty three, Shoutin' ""I'm full o' pep! Watch yo' step!, watch yo' step! One legged Joe danced aroun' on his toe, Threw away his crutch and hollered, ""let 'er go!"" Oh, honey, hail! hail! the gang's all here For an Alabama jubilee Mandolins, violins, Hear the darkies tunin' up, the fun begins, Come this way, don't delay, Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin' Music sweet, rag-time treat, Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet, It's a reminder, a memory finder Of nights down in old Alabam'. Hear that flute, it's a beaut, And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute? Let's begin, it's a sin, To be missin' all this syncopated music! Oh, you Jane, once again Give your legs some exercise to that refrain, Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me Back home to my old Alabam'.",Alabama Jubilee
Ferlin Husky,"The Gods were angry with me for loving you
The Gods were angry with me because they knew
I stood at heaven's portal and that was too high for any model such as I
So they took down the sun the skies were gray 
Then the howling winds took you away
And there was nothing I could do
Because I knew the Gods were angry with me for loving you
Once upon a time when our love was new
And I was happy with the love that I've found
Then the Gods and the sun and the moon and the stars looked down
And saw me there with you
And they sent my dream world crash into the ground
(It was because the Gods were angry with me)
The Gods were angry with me",Gods Were Angry With Me
Ferlin Husky,"Haven't got a worry haven't got a care I haven't got a thing to call my own
Though I'm out of money and I'm a millionaire
I still have my home in San Antone when I greet my neighbor with a hi y'all
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
But when I feel like braggin' I just up and say I'm a native son of San Antone
Well I travel around the country on my merry way
I've been to crowds and felt I was alone
But when I feel like braggin' I just up and say I'm a native son of San Antone
There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo someday she's goin' to be my very own
And we'll buy a high chair in a year or so for our little home in San Antone

Ferlin Husky,"Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
But I know oh yes I know I'd never make that same mistake again
Looking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise girl heeds
But if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing but I gave nothing in return
Now I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learned
Looking back over the slate I can see love turn to hate
But I know oh yes I know I'll never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing",Looking Back
Ferlin Husky,"Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
The roses have faded there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
Oh where has she gone to oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand hold to my hand



",Alone and Forsaken
Ferlin Husky,"Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
[ steel ]
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you



",I Could Never Be Ashamed of You
Ferlin Husky,"Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight I'm alone and oh so blue tonight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea may you never be alone like me
I believed the lies you told to me when you said my dear I worship Thee
Now here am I alone and blue all because I loved no one but you
[ steel ]
I gave up my friends I left my home when you promised to be mine alone
Now you're gone our love could never be may you never be alone like me
In the Bible God's own words to say for every wrong someday you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free may you never be alone like me



",May You Never Be Alone
Ferlin Husky,"Like a shadow I stood by you I was happy and thought you were too
But you turned out the light and made things so dim
That my shadow won't darken your door again
No my shadow won't darken your door again
When a light's gone a shadow will come to an end
And I know I'm no more to you than a friend
No my shadow won't darken your door again

Like a shadow I followed you where you went I always went too
But I got lost in the fall and another stepped in
Now my shadow won't darken your door again

Ferlin Husky,"What's the use to deny we've been living in lie that we should have admitted before
We were just victims of a half hearted love so why should we try anymore
The vows that we make are only to break we drift like a wave from the shore
The kisses we steal we know are not real so why should we try anymore

Our story so old again has been told on the past let's close the door
And smile don't regret just live and forget oh why should we try anymore",Why Should We Try Anymore
Ferlin Husky,"I'll try anything that's new if something old won't do
If I can make you happy when you're feeling blue
Cause I love you yes I love you all of the time
I love every breath you take I love the love you make
I love the way you walk even when you walk away
Cause I want you yes I want you all of the time
But don't go too far when you walk away cause I want you near near me night and day
I can't do without things you do for me in your own sweet love able way

But don't go too far",All of the Time

I told myself it was over I was happy but then I saw you and it started again

",I Will
Ferlin Husky,"I can see us sittin' round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

There's a family Bible on the table each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
At the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin'...

This old world of ours is full of trouble but this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
I can see us sittin'...



",Family Bible
Ferlin Husky,"If when you give the best of your service telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismayed when man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done

Refrain
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done

Misunderstood, the savior of sinners, hung on the cross he was God's only son
Oh hear Him call to His father in heaven, let not my will but Thine be done.

If when you've tried and failed in your trying, hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and come quickly to Jesus, He'll understand and say well done.



",He'll Understand and Say Well Done
Ferlin Husky,"You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed down and eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
Now you've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were propers some were kings and some were masters of arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where you start
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts",Men With Broken Hearts
Ferlin Husky,"Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last

Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play when evening shadows come
Then winding down that old familiar pathway I heard my mother call at set of sun
Some of the fondest mem'ries of my childhood are woven around suppertime
When mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home Ferlin it's suppertime what I would give to hear that once more
But for me time has woven a realization of the truth that's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes up from the portal of glory to come home
For it's suppertime when all of God's children shall gather around the table
With the Lord at the greatest suppertime of them all
Come home come home...

Twenty one boy twenty one
Now you were just a young feller son the night your mama died
You don't remember but we were right there by mama's side
Your ma had a sickness son all the works she'd done
And she prayed all her life that God would let her raise you to be twenty one

Now me and you never moved the town boy we just kept on living here
And life's been pretty tough son with the past twenty one years
I remember when you were just a little feller I sued to take you to church

And it seemed my boy in the choir
With the other boys kinda give old dad's heart a jerk
You sounded like a little angel boy and to me you sure did look sweet
Even though your little ragged britches came halfway to your little feet

After the service was over it filled your papa's heart full of joy
When the preacher petted you on your little head
Looked over me and say you sure got a fine little boy
Then me and you we'd get in the wagon and you'd look over me and smile
Then I'd hand you the line and let you drive the team for a while

Yeah boy me and you had lot of fun we smiled through a lot of tears
And I wish you could have been a boy for a many million years
But if it's true son that time takes its toe
That's why the boys grow up and men grow old

Yeah life's been tough for you and me too son
And I prayed to God to let me raise ye to be twenty one

Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul

Needing a friend to help me in the end (now tell me) where could I go but to the Lord

Please take good care of her take good care of her
I must accepted she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefuly

Ferlin Husky,"The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights

(Lights that say forget her name) in a glass of cherry wine
(Lights that offer other girls) for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights

(Lights that say forget her love) in a different atmosphere
(Lights that lure are nothing) but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights

Ferlin Husky,"FROM A JACK TO A KING
WRITER NED MILLER


From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen and walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king with no regrets I stackled the cards last night
And Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen you made me king of your heart

All the things come to an end
Yes that means we'll never love again
The end of our love the end of my dreams

And this loneliness goes on and on and on
On and on and on as if there were no tomorrow
As if the night had come to stay and there would be no dawn

A long, long time ago On graduation day You handed me your book I signed this way: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you."" We dated through high school. And when the big day came, I wrote into your book, next to my name: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you."" Then I went far away And you found someone new I read your letter dear And I wrote back to you: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But luck may god bless you. ""Is that your little girl? She looks a lot like you. Someday some boy will write in her book, too. ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you.""

So they can't gather around her and say

Ferlin Husky,"Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol 
destroy everything that God gave him

I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop 
While the steering wheel's in their hand

This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away

As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
""Get out of the road you little fools""
And the car, it brought them down

The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car 
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son

Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', ""Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done""
And his attention then was called away 
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, ""Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about, 
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it",Drunken Driver
Ferlin Husky,"I just don't like this kind of living when nobody's lonesome for me
I'm heading down the long lost highway may you never be alone like me
Your cold cold crazy cheating heart gave me the lovesick blues
I can't help it if you win again you know I still want you
I'd like to turn back the years when we heard the wedding bells chime
When I was howling at the moon and your cheating heart was mine
A mansion on the hill is a house without love
Why don't you love me like you used to do
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave but I could never be ashamed of you
I hear that lonesome whistle blowing never again will I knock on your door

Sweet mem'ries when will you go away when will I be free from yesterday
Sweet mem'ries your love has come and gone
But a touch of yesterday keeps hanging on

Sweetheart it would be easier for me to walk on water
Than for me to find the way to forget you
I cried myself to sleep last night and this morning I cried harder
And relived the very moment that I met you
I never thought I'd see the day I'd be praying for an ending
An ending to be only love I've known
If our goodbye had been strong enough to destroy our beginning
Then my reason to remember would be gone

And how his first word about that old truck was Giddy up go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough

A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddy up go
Well I pushed old Giddy up go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop

Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck

And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66

And he's handled that big rig
Better than any gear jammer that I'd ever seen

Ferlin Husky,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

Fermin IV,"Confieso que no ha sido fácil comenzar el verso
Pero todo tiene que tener su inicio con un verbo

Se necesita acción en todos los procesos
Se necesita a Dios en este comienzo

Y empezamos a crear nuestras propias divisiones
Formamos sindicatos para separarnos

Y poder hacer y deshacer lo que queramos
Dimos la espalda al que nos había creado
Al independizarnos perdimos el contrato

Donde estaba todo escrito y estipulado
Donde se encontraba el mapa para regresarnos
Ahora volvemos a necesitarlo

Requerimos un regalo para así reconciliarnos
Pero no tenemos nada con que comprarlo
Y muchos ni queremos solucionarlo

Es la mezcla, la mezcla perfecta, es la mezcla perfecta
Es la mezcla de la eternidad, si, si, ah, ah
Es la mezcla, la mezcla perfecta, es la mezcla perfecta
Es la mezcla de la eternidad

Que haremos para reunirnos de nuevo
Si nuestros edificios no llegan hasta el cielo
Por mas que intentemos no lo lograremos

Lo único es que perdemos nuestro tiempo
Es como si quisieramos tapar el sol con un dedo
Por eso nos volvemos ciegos

Y Dios tuvo que bajar para recogernos
Como un regalo que no merecemos
Como la mezcla perfecta es como volvemos

El creador y su creación hacia el firmamento
Para vivir hasta el fin de los tiempos eternamente

Lorsque je vous ai vue pour la première fois
Vous étiez au jardin, arrosant des petits pois
Quand je vous ai souri vous me fîtes l’honneur
De me dire Monsieur vous m’avez bien faut peur
Et j’ai pensé que ce Dimanche
M’avait placé sur le chemin
Du bonheur cueillit sous les branches
Et j’ai murmuré : A demain
Vous n’êtes pas venue Lundi
Je vous ai attendu Mardi
J’ai remis ça le mercredi
J’ai pensé peut-être Jeudi
Et j’ai poireauté Vendredi
Vous n’étiez pas là Samedi
J’ai passé la semaine ainsi
Le Dimanche j’avais saisi

Mais comme je voulais vous revoir à tout prix
J’avoue que ce retard m’avait un peu surpris
Je me suis dis : Hector ! faut te faire une raison
Et je suis revenu devant votre maison
Car j’ai pensé que ce Dimanche
Mettrait votre en  émoi
Et j’ai attendu sous les branches
Et comptant les jours sur les doigts

Vous n’étiez pas là en Janvier
J’ai attendu tout février
J’ai remis ça, Mars, Avril, Mai
J’ai eu chaud de Juin à Juillet
J’ai transpiré tout le mois d’Août
Vint septembre, octobre c’est fou
Novembre, j’ai eu froid partout
En décembre j’étais à bout

Hélas ! je ne dors plus, car je ne comprend pas
Cette absence voulue et je me dis tout bas
Viendra-t-elle un beau soir ? Viendra-t-elle un beau jour ?
Pour que je puisse enfin lui dire mon amour
En pensant qu joli Dimanche
De la saison des petits pois
J’erre comme un fou sous les branches
Car depuis le doute est en moi

Je vous ai attendu un an
Deux ans, trois ans, quatre ans, dix ans
Vous n’étiez pas là, et pourtant
Mes cheveux sont devenus tout blancs
J’ai pris racine sur un banc
Et maintenant tout tremblotant

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And ya screaming to the top of yours lungs
And the bells done rung and the crowd can't hear you

And all that I can see is a building burning
I just gotta rescue my baby
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone
I just wanna be here to pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking, and the only one
Who can save me is you but you wanna throw me

Away, away, away, away, oh why?

Girls, 'cause it changes, and it ain't got to be no real season
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that open, and the moment you walk in it close

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love, just ain't what it used to be
I confronted my fears with open arms, although you said
You will never give up on us, but now you blow me

Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me
Away, away, away, away, oh why?

So why is this happening to me?

No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry

But You are mindful when the sparrow falls
And mindful of the anxious thoughts
That find me, surround me and bind me

With all my heart I love You, Sovereign Lord
Tomorrow let me love You even more
And rise to speak the goodness of Your name
Until I close my eyes and sleep again

To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

My eyes saw a far horizon,

And escape this earthly prison.

When the ties no longer bind?

And I would fight for you with all the strength that I could find
I would lead you home by your tiny hand

Brings them home again,
Rigging lines and anchors in the harbor.

Born in the autumn of 1916

A shy, pretty girl from East Texas
Religious and restless
Humble and kind as a person could be

She loved to sing in the choir
Loud and inspired
Her head tilted down, keeping time

Or tell stories with friends after supper
Ignoring the hour
A calico cat fast asleep at her side

And she loved to drive
Her big red car
Though she couldn't see over
The hood very far
She'd back out the driveway
And point that thing down the road
We'd say, Lord, there she goes

Her hair was silver and messy
She walked in a hurry
Worried about wasting the day

Some nights she sat at her dresser
Composing long letters
Falling asleep with a pen in her hand

And she loved to drive
Her big red car
A scarf round her shoulders
Her foot to the floor
Down to the grocery
She'd wave good-bye 
And we'd pray
Lord, bring her back safe.

Sometimes I find you
On the other side of pain

But sometimes in the heat of day
When I close my eyes to pray
It seems like you are far from me
My prayers are all in vain

In my hour of hopelessness
In my deep despair
The noonday devil whispers in my ear

I know that you are with me
But I can't feel a thing
The noonday devil 
Has come around again

Oh Lord, make me angry
Oh Lord, make me cry
Oh Lord, please don't leave me here
To fall into the devil's lies

Father, you have called me
To live a life that's true
That all my labors and my words
Would speak my love for you

But walking through this desert
Life is empty and mundane
The noonday devil 
Has come around again

Oh Lord, make me angry
Oh Lord, make me cry
Oh Lord, please don't leave me here
To fall into the devil's lies

Oh Lord, make me angry
Oh Lord, make me cry
Oh Lord, break my cold, cold heart
So I can know your love inside
Your love inside",Noonday Devil
Fernando Ortega,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to the cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.",Rock of Ages
Fernando Ortega,"Though I am weak
Sometimes weary
In times of trial
I hide my face
In the balance
Judge me wholly
Please don't judge me 
By my shame

In dark hours 
Of confrontation
When words may fall
Too soon to unsay
Don't mistake them
For my true meaning
They are measures 
Of my shame

I have tried to
Live life humbly
Not a coward
Not in vain
When my meekness
Overcomes me
Remember me
Not my shame
Not my shame

I am small
And self-conscious
Every mirror
Reflects the grain
Judge my essence
By my kinships
Remember me
Not my shame

I am weak
Sometimes weary
Sometimes small
I hide away
When my hours
Are all accounted
Please don't bind me

Fernando Ortega,"Another sleepless night
I'm turning in my bed
Long before the red sun rises

In these early hours
I'm falling again
Into the river of my worries

When the river runs away
I find a shelter in your name

Jesus, only light on the shore
Only hope in the storm
Jesus, let me fly to your side
There I would hide, Jesus

Hear my anxious prayer
The beating of my heart
The pulse and the measure of my unbelief
Speak your words to me
Before I come apart
Help me believe in what I cannot see
Before the river runs away
I will call upon your name

Jesus, only light on the shore
Only hope in the storm
Jesus, let me fly to your side
There I would hide, Jesus",Sleepless Night
Fernando Ortega,"Take heart, my friend, we'll go together
This uncertain road that lies ahead
Our faithful God has always gone before us
And He will lead the way once again

Take heart, my friend, we can walk together
And if our burdens become too great
We can hold up and help one other
In God's love and God's grace

Take heart my friend, the Lord is with us
As He has been all the days of our lives
Our assurance every morning
Our defender in the night

If we should falter when trouble surrounds us
When the wind and the waves are wild and high
We will look away to Him who ruled the waters
Who spoke His peace into the angry tide

He is our comfort, our sustainer
He is our help in time of need
When we wander, He is our Shepherd
He who watches over us never sleeps

Fernando Ortega,"Midnight in the yard
A dog begins to bark
The next-door neighbor
Shuts her kitchen blinds
Up on the moonlit rise
Joe-Jack sleeps outside
On an old gunnysack
Filled with soda cans

Out across the lawn
2 cats have their fun

Epi and Lou on the slippery grass
They tumble and jump in a crazy dance
Look up at the stars like they're in a trance
Climb the willow tree

Epi and Louie freeze
They don't blink or breathe
A sudden danger
In the atmosphere
Walking down the road
Sniffing as he goes
An old coyote
His eyes are yellow green

Trickster on the prowl
Throws back his head and howls

The night heats up when the coyote comes
He won't rest till his work is done
Critters flee when he comes around
Some won't make it home

Life is never what it seems
Pull me from this waking dream
I should have come inside
So much guilt, so much regret
Don't let my life be over
Let me come inside
I wanna come inside

Epi and Lou run across the yard
They look to the window but it's much too far
They turn and race for the broken car
Barely make it in

He won't rest till his work is done
Every critter flees when he comes around
Some won't make it home",When the Coyote Comes

Fernando Otero,"[Chorus]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war, can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidote and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohamed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people, just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Chorus]

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Chorus]

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

las cosas que el hombre olvidó
lo que nadie escribió,

trayendo la vida que han robado al mar
A quién le importará que las gaviotas
vuelen la historia del mar
Guarda el tiempo en las Bastillas
unas cuantas semillas
que entrega una canción
pero hay un lugar donde olvido floreció
Guardan polvos Las Bastillas el tiempo
una semilla, quizás una canción
Pero quién guardará las cosas
que no son de Dios
y buscan las hormigas por la tierra
migar y migas hasta hacer un pan
a quién le importará que las hormigas
miguen su propia verdad
y nace esta canción desde el cemento

y el canto de un zorzal
se perderá en el ruido de

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Ferrante & Teicher,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away

That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

If you're so full of grace
Then send it
On down

[Verse: 2]
Lessons we learn
From the top of our birth
Are an endless source of confusion
See I'm on a search
Because I've heard
You've got a magic solution

And god
It's time that you explain
And god
Are you even there

Dear god
Your grace
Send it on down

Say the things we mean most
They remain inside us

When I dream I cant sleep
When I miss I miss you
When I leave it always leaves me
Wanting wanting

Don't give up on me
We may need a miracle
When I look at you theres an angel who
Never left me completely
Don't give up on me
Cause we are
When I look at you I see an angel that wants to leave
Don't you give up on me

When we least expect it
They decide to break through
Seems a heart may know me
I know you know you
When I sleep I cant
When I miss I
When I stay I'm always staying for you for you

Don't give up on me
We may need a miracle
When I look at you
Theres and angel who never left me completely
Don't give up on me
Cause we are the musical
When we touch when you feel when see what I could be
Don't you give up on me

And for thing we take
We must give something
And our hearts will have to break
Before we feel something feel something
All I destroy
Begins to mean something
Without you without the trust
With out us

Ferras,"If it's fear that you feel
The fear exists
On a larger scale
Spin the world
And stop it still
Anywhere you land
Anyone you kill
You are gonna find that

Everybody bleeds the same
After all
Everybody feels the same
Pain
And the preachers preach
And they write it all down
Like they know
But the secret is
Everybody bleeds the same

I am you and you are me
We are the same mistake
Packaged differently
Who is your god
When you pray
If you break it down
To the DNA
You are gonna find that

Everybody bleeds the same
After all
Everybody feels the same
Pain
And the preachers preach
And they write it all down
Like they know
But the secret is
Everybody bleeds the same

While soldiers pull the covers
Over there dead
Roll over to your lover
Say put your arms around me
Surround me in the darkness
And I'll pray to every god
My soul to keep
Cause I'm never ever
Gonna get to sleep
Help me dream
I wanna dream forever

Ferras,"Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a center-fold

But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes herself at all

Looking for a thrill but you've done it all

So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember Hollywood's not America
So long put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home

And everybody heres, from somewhere else
You could make a million dollars, but you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat will your heart go cold
They say acting's just pretending, even that gets old

Wonder where my clothes are
Try to find some more stars

That I always dream
I light a cigarette
And it's not right
Where's my ashtray
Where the hell did I put my coffee
I can't find anything
One thing goes wrong

Has anyone found me
I guess I'll just have to wait
Until the next life
Hang around for the next laugh

The bigger part of nothing

Do I even like me

To be so cool
But you know what's cool
Not trying

Were right here

Ferris MC,"Der Frühling wird endlich seinem Ruf gerecht
Das Eis ist weg, der ganze Dreck
Das grüne und blaue kommen aus ihrem Versteck
Das fade und graue wäscht sich raus, wie ein Fleck
Hab mein gefräßiges Herz an den Nagel gehängt
Die Ketten drum herum hab ich weggesprengt
Hab meine Füße auf den harten Asphalt gestellt
Und meine Flügel, schwer wie Blei, ins Meer versenkt
Ich hab die falschen Freunde vom Hof gejagt
Die Zweifel angeklagt und die Angst vertagt
Die Stunde Null hat begonnen
Aus der Asche entsprung', der Sommer kann kommen

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit

Ich hab mehrmals verloren, um einmal zu gewinnen
Um nach jedem Scheitern wieder neu zu beginnen
Sie hat mich einmal berührt, für immer geheilt
Die alte Haut auf'm Boden verteilt
Ich kann die Augen wieder öffnen, gewöhnen mich ans Licht
Kann jetzt klar sehen, hab jetzt freie Sicht
Ich werd' wie die Drachen vom Himmel steigen
Tausend Geigen sollen mich begleiten
Schlage Wellen, um den Sturm zu entfachen
Lass ihn mit 300 Sachen in die Stadt rein krachen
Ich bin nicht mehr getrieben, ich lass mich treiben
Und wenn ich schon mal da bin, werd' ich auch bleiben

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh' auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit

Wie ein Dieb war ich auf der Flucht vor ihr
Doch sie hat mich gefunden, schon nach wenigen Stunden
In einem fensterlosen Raum kam mir die Zeit abhanden
Wie kalt und ausgebrannt ich war, hab ich lange nicht verstanden
Die Müllabfuhr hätte mich fast eingesackt
Wie ein alter Sack, der nichts mehr von alleine packt
Doch eine Stimme hat gesagt, es ist zu früh um aufzugeben
Meine Zeit sei gekommen, um es anzunehmen, dieses Leben

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh' auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück

Rate mal, wer ihn am nächsten Morgen streicheln darf

Heute nehmen wir es nicht so genau
Denn es ist Nacht und alle Katzen sind grau
Sie singen ""Miau, miau, miau""
Bis der Kater kommt, bis der Kater kommt

Morgen früh zeigt das erste Licht
Sie sind noch ein bisschen grau im Gesicht
Der Kopf macht au, au, au
Wenn der Kater kommt, wenn der Kater kommt

Er braucht das Licht nicht, er kann im Dunkeln sehen
Wie sie am Wochenende alle ihre Runden drehen
All die Katzen wissen, morgen wird es unbequem
Wenn die Stunden dieser Nacht vor die Hunde gehen

Aus der Gosse bis zum höchsten Kratzbaum
Von der High Society bis hin zum letzten Abschaum
Keiner hält ihn auf - ihr könnt machen, was ihr wollt
Er lässt sich nicht bestechen, auch nicht mit Katzengold

Ferron,"I watch you reading a book
I get to thinking our love's a polished stone
You give me a long drawn look
I know pretty soon you're going to leave our home
And of course I mind,
Especially when I'm thinking from my heart
But life don't clickety clack down a straight line track
It comes together and it comes apart.
You say you hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes
You give me the furniture, we'll divide the photographs
Go out to dinner one more time
Have ourselves a bottle of wine
And a couple of laughs
And when first you left
I stayed so sad I wouldn't sleep
I know that love's a gift, I thought yours was mine
And something that I could keep
Now I realize that time is not the only compromise
But a bird in the hand could be an all night stand
Between a blazing fire and a pocket of skies
So I hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes
I covered the furniture, I framed the photographs
Went out to dinner one more time
Had myself a bottle of wine and a couple of laughs
And just the other day
I got your letter in the mail
I'm happy for you, its been so long
You've been wanting a cabin and a backwoods trail
And I think that's great...me...
I seem to find myself in school
It's all Ok, I just want to say
I'm so relieved we didn't do it cruel
But ain't life a brook
Just when I get to feeling like a polished stone
I give me along drawn look
It's kind of a drag to find yourself alone
And sometimes I mind
Especially when I'm waiting on your heart
But life don't clickety clack down a straight line track
It comes together and it comes apart.
Cause I know you're not the kind
To make me feel obliged
To go ticking through my time with a pained look
In my eyes
I sold the furniture, I put away the photographs
Went out to dinner one more time
Skipped the bottle of wine
Had a couple of laughs
And wasn't it fine....",Ain't Life a Brook
Ferron,"It's a quiet street in someone's town
On stranger's feet I mark my ground
I trace my circles round and round
I'm sworn to find me
In a party scene and I'd just got loose
Its my devil's luck to be introduced
To one who takes their shape like you
It unbinds me

We knew we wouIdn't have everything
And time proves it true
I've got a flat-top six dressed in steel strings
And I don't have you
You wouIdn't like the life
And I wouIdn't want you to

There's a secret in this solitude
As my love unfolds I find it's often crude
I call you late and my words intrude
And I falter
But the miles don't shrink by telephone
The crackling wire becomes our home
I tell you I'm okay alone
And then I wonder
I've got towns ahead
And shows behind
And I won't be lost

I join my name to that solid line
Though it always costs
But it takes my time
And it fills my mind
And it feeds the ghost of
Memories in the quiet heat
When our words were trim
And our hope was neat
We said our purpose here
Was to be complete with 'I want you'
It's a woman's dream this autonomy
Where the lines connect
And the points stay free
We said passion as an open sea
Would only haunt you
I watch the last cab
Turn its headlights down
To today's sunrise
I must have wanted you in every town
And it's no surprise
That want alone don't sit you down
By my love eyes
I've got memories in the quiet heat
When our words were trim
And our hope was neat
We said our purpose here
Was to be complete with 'I want you'",Our Purpose Here

Your stride stumble you down

Don't it make you
Think that maybe
You're okay alone

Pool of faces
All are strangers crying
Who is living there?

One could prove their spot

Ferron,"They said some men would be warriors and some men would be kings
And some men would be owners of land and other man-made things
And false love as the eternal flame would move some to think in
rings
And gold would be our power and other foolish things
But you who dream of liberty must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom, you've agreed to being ruled
If the body stays a shackle then the mind remains a chain
That'll link you to a destiny whereby all good souls are slain
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all
It won't take long, and you may say
""What has that got to do with me"" and I say,
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
Of three men in a desert wandering, one is knowing and two are
scared
They say time is in the river, but the river is not there
Dry in spirit dry in body two will lend themselves to death
And in grief one weeps into his hands and drinks his bitter
tears
'Cause it don't take long, it don't take too long at all
It don't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know what you're talking about,"" and I say
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
And as I stand before you now, I am hopeful in my rage
You know love has finally called for me, I will not wilt upon
its stage
But still smaller than my nightmare now do I print upon the page
Do we have to live inside its walls to identify the cage?
'Cause it takes so long, why does it take so long,
But it takes so long, and you may say,
""I don't really care what you're talking about,"" and I say,
""Are you trying to say you don't belong?""
I am my mother's daughter, but I have seen myself in you
It's this blessing that I follow now, and so I must speak true
I dreamed of thousands dying, it was you and you and you,
And while the city sleeps so quietly there is something we must
do
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know if I want to know what you're getting at,""
And it makes we want to say, ""So long.""
Because grief will come in measures, only grief alone will know
And you'll see it on your family, on your own face it will grow
And they'll try to keep you hungry, then they'll tell you to eat
snow
You know pride can be a moving thing if we learn the strength of
""NO!""
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think this has anything to do with me,""
""But did you ever think you could be wrong?""
At noon on one day coming, human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet, hear the sound of angry feet
With business freezed up in the harbour, the kings will pull
upon their
hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt, and the artists will be
there
'Cause it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think I can be a part of that,"" and it makes me want to
say,
""Don't you want to see yourself that strong?""
Division between the peoples will disappear that honoured day
And though oceans lie between us, lifted candles light the way
Half will join their hands by moonlight, the rest under a rising
sun
As underneath the sun and moon, a ritual'd wailing has begun
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about,""
and it makes
me want to say, ""Come on!""
And beware you sagging diplomats, for you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked we will not be undone
For as we let ourselves be bought, we're going to let ourselves
be free
And if you think we stand alone, look again and you will see:
We are children in the rafters, we are babies in the park,
We are lovers at the movies, we are candles in the dark,
We are changes in the weather, we are snowflakes in July,
We are women grown together, we are men who easily cry,
We are words not quickly spoken, we're the deeper side of try,
We are dreamers in the making, we are not afraid of ""Why?""",It Won't Take Long

",Dear Marly
Ferron,"After Sally came, it's like we fell apart... no more hands in pockets and whispered, denim doorway talks at night. Love was just a game that lonely tourists played, and we'd weave in and out of their dreams unfettered. 

But now when she stares you down, you're just like a small shoe lost at sea and until a strong wind blows you round, it's better not to think about you and me, but if there's anything else I can do... why don't you call me...

It's so easy to laugh with strangers who say they've gone sick on love enough. It's harder to tell each other our deepest, secret stuff. There'll always be gorgeous babes around...it's the nature of towns at midnight...liquid, our promises to reach for pleasure and never to fall down. 

But now when she touches you, you're just like a fire got outta hand and until the facts shine through it might be better if we just don't make a plan. But if there's anything else I can do...


...Someone's been walking by your lane at night. Someone's been calling out your name so light---come out, come out---someone's been hoping that maybe you'd catch their light...but there's no sign from you, no sign, so maybe it's true that...


...when she pulls you down, you're just like a skip on ship-to-shore. Until the tide turns 'round I guess it's better just to say we both want more, but should there be anything else I can do baby...call me.

Ferron,"First comes the kiss
Then comes the hands too hot to touch
Feeling like this
I want to be with you so much
Driving to work in the morning
Everyone's house looks warm inside
I can't believe what I'm thinking
I've got to be out of my mind
When you give me a cactus flower
I figure you're telling me how it is
We make love, it's a cosmic shower
And I ask you, are we friends too
I talk to my sister about it all
To see what she did when she was here
She tells me don't give up your freedom
Which goes to show freedom is not so clear
I'm alive in my center
And true to the core is (in) how I feel
(And) I don't believe I have entered
The place she says where (when) nothing's real
You give me a heart shaped box
I give you a crackerjack ring
You say here I come ready or not
And I say I'd do anything for you
I call up my old friends to tell them
Any excuse to say your name
Finally I'm touched and I'm open
Fear and elation now feel the same
More and more often
I wave off friends to stay alone
The life of the party is nothing
Compared to the mystery that waits at home
When you give me a brown care bear
I give you a miniature moving van
When you tell me that brown bear cares
I say yes we can, yes we can
( Every move you never made
Every word you could not say
Every cry you cried alone
Can remain with us instead.

And a fish for every sea

Ferron,"I'd think of all those people with their love and understanding
How they wear it like they had it from the start
I must have been the other kind...
the kind with just a lonely mind and heart
And from where you stand you're an attractive revelation
And from where I stand I'm mostly on my knees
And from there I said hello, felt something small and slow
Say ""Please, please, please""
And though it's just a thought, It's such a saving shot...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among the broken ones.
I remember crying down a long and withered highway
I remember waiting for my story to begin.
Had all my laughs cut short, a boat without a port
A ragged house of tin.
But ... maybe it's true about the teacher when you're ready
Maybe it's true about the hollow and the slope
Love, turn my steps around
Let me fall on solid ground with Faith and rope.
And though its just a thought, I say it's all I've got...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among
the broken ones.
Outside a window there's a night beyond all secrets
And outside that window there's a window shining in
And it shows a room that has a fire steady burning
And a woman knowing that the darkness can't come in
And she wants to thank you for your love and understanding
She needs to thank you for your honour to the soul
It's love from someone who believed she'd need a stand in
To tell her story let alone to live it whole
And though it's just a thought, she says it's all we've got
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among
the broken ones.

Ferron,"Now it's christmas on the cape and I'm a tag-a-long friend
Another winter on the island mighta driven me insane.
It's been a series of cheery gatherings coming slow to a
   close
And the last few can't seem to say goodbye
and in their laughter I'm dozing
And a knock on the door
It wakes me up with a start
You're standing there with your new love
Oh! Home of my heart!
I try to think of what I'm wearing, hoping none of its yours
I was amazed at what becomes you after everything goes
And I see...she doesn't have my slouch
And....she doesn't have my nose
And she doesn't have my luck
And...she doesn't have your clothes!!

Ferron,"Be easy with love
Be easy with heartache
Alone on your road
that good thing might find you
you're easy
Darkness may come
and cast its long shadow
in the light of your day
Be easy with friends
Be easy with laughter
and you'll keep it away
Through your long night
and through all your pain
the Spirit Doctor say
you know, you're gonna be alright
and when you're better
you're gonna do it all again
Through your long night
and through all your pain

Ferron,"I am hungry how are you?
You say that every lie came true
I will hold you anyway
And you'll grow strong and leave one day
Is there any other way?
Look desire in its face
Watch it eat and leave no trace
After you have disappeared
Who will know and who will hear?
Oh it's such delicious fear.
Brushes with a starving hand
Just the ache I understand
After you have swallowed me
Who do you think you will be?
You'll be you and I'll be me.
And still I will lay my body down
And in your many voices drown
Oh we are a hidden pool
We are so long we are so cool
While underneath we're dark and cruel
And I am hungry how are you?
You say that every lie came true
I will hold you anyway
And you'll grow strong and leave one day

But : take the front door leave just one
And don't return there are no chances pending

Ferron,"Every person has their story, the one they vamp
And revamp
There is a way through constant sorrow
But we must do more than light the lamp

Unlike Zhivago at the window Pining Lara's love
We dare not wait the weather to join the
High suspended dove
Cause yesterday my baby girl walked up to a little boy
And I watched her curl her arms around him
And transform her fear to joy

And if I believe we've blown our purpose
Then I might have missed the chance
To see Gandhi in two babies bodies
And watch them spin and dance

You gotta go for fire
You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And Live your story tall and well

Maybe you can't believe somehow
That things can turn around
All your life it just seemed like some were destined upward
And some were destined down

And it's just not gonna be that simple for us
Cause it's not so hard to see
That's it's a huge and limitless sky describing what will be
And there might be a disillusioning calm
In the winds that blow

But believe that changes come
Keep your dream, knowing dreams come slow
And beat your drum for those before you
And for those eager on the side
And light a candle for life's still and riotous dream to
Dwell where love abides

You gotta go for the mystery
You gotta go for the high true flight
To deny the grace in tragedy
Is to deny the beauty in the owl's lonesome night
You gotta go for fire

You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And live your story cell to cell to cell
If we're in everything we think, and everything we do

Then I am in you and you're in me
And only Nothing is as true
There is a way through constant sorrow
There is a way through constant sorrow
There is a way through constant sorrow",Primitive Future
Ferron,"The night before the day we meet
I make my walk on sacred ground
I turn my eyes up to most soulful sky
And in evening soil my heels sink down
I hear people laughing together down the way
And as their glasses tinkle in their play
I'm in between the moon and tomorrows light
And I cannot know how close you are.
The beast and baby have to meet
Until they do, they cry, they cry alone
The moon must line up with the sun
And burn the path that lights us home
I've seen your face a thousand times
And I've heard your voice in everything
And but I've always known
That love would be a simple song that I would sing
And as I wait I sing this song to you
And to a hollow moon like a golden ring
And to a tree that stands solo in an opening
The night before the day we meet.
And the beast and baby have to meet
Until they do they cry, and they cry alone
And the moon must line up with the sun
And burn the path that lights us home
I've seen your face a thousand times
And I heard your voice in everything
And I've always known that love would be
The simple song that I would sing
The night before the day you come

And I want to bring my head down and kiss someone
I have all my human senses...now, can I calm my senses?
Can I calm my freedom ?
Can I calm my sense of freedom?",Signals and Messages
Ferron,"Sadie's momma was a tanker always bowling her
down to the ground
And when Sadie got old enough she moved it on
Her freedom was a one way bus to another town
She had a little money, bought a dress and she put it on
And she worked her days in an all night restaurant
It was called believe or not...Anything You Want
There was a woman on the graveyard shift that
Sadie liked a lot
And she even took to coming early just in case
they could have some time
It seemed that anything the graveyard lady wanted
the graveyard lady got
And Sadie decided the difference between them
was a shadow line
Years would fly before she'd bother to try
to be her own true face
Right now seemed like every thing was sadly stuck in place
Hot town, Toronto, l951
The Spring is doing its stuff
She sends a letter home to say ""I've come undone""
All they say ""that's tough""
Another birthday pass her by and she has a dream
one night that she can fly
And she goes to work that day and all she does is cry cry cry
And Sadie finally meet a man who dances a jig
and she follows him down
But don't he turn out to be a little angel of misery
Living quiet in a private dream, protected by a frozen frown
Periodically he looks up and says
""Sadie, what's to become of you and me?""
It's at these times that she holds his head
Half wishing all the while that he's holding her instead
And she finally tells him that and it blows his mind...

Ferron,"She told me about a silver lake tucked tight
Behind a rock face
Your basic demons tell you fools come late
I had my reasons but they left me in the night

Where the quiet meets the cracking of a heartbreak
Some mountains you can wander in the night
And some mountains you're not supposed to know
It's like...some people got their wild wild hearts

And some others bide their time until they meet them
When co ordinates are disappearing stars
Maps can't help you can't believe them
You need good vision, clear water in your flask

And time to feel the surging of your heart beat
Your best companion is the one who's gonna ask about
Your soul-lined connection to your foolish feet
Some mountains you can wander in the dark

Some moments are a circus in the park
I've met the desert with its hot dry wind
I know pain...I get enough through predilection
A hundred people want to tell you where they've been

A hundred others want to go in that direction
I long to say I actually made it to the top
And gazed out across that glassy water
I wasted nights with dreams of kisses so hot

Course the ending was same as if I'd gone without her

I'm eager to please, so much I deceive

All feels wrong when you're away from me
The thought that nothing is what it seems

No escape I cannot fight

Jo ick bün de Jung achtern Plattenspeeler
Un so deel ick op as Störtebeker sine Likkedeeler

Dor is for jeden wot dorbi wat ick speel
Bi uns in heet dat nich ""Disco"" dondern ""Dans op de Deel""
Ick krackehl veel Platt in dat Mikrofon
Büst nich unt'n Norden is dat schwer to verstohn

Wohn' anne Waterkant dohn wi all un da schnackt man nu ma so
Hör ma'n beeten to, hummel, hummel ""Mors, mors""
Ick bün ruut, de Schippmester bün as de annern
Nordisch by Nature

Sach mal weißt du überhaupt, was das Leben hier so bringt?
Was das regulär bedeutet, wenn dein Schicksal dich linkt?
Und du morgens deine Stullen auf dem Küchentisch vergisst
Aber die ganze Schose erst bei Blohm und Voss vermisst

Dat is nich so leicht wie du meinst min Jung
Dat is ne Schietbuckelei und die macht den Rücken krumm
Hart genug sacht man sich und gibt sich selten auf die Schnauze
Und wenn wir uns mal hauen, dann n Holsten in die Plautze

Mao Tse Tung war bei uns nie so n Thema
Mutter sagt, ""Politiker die kommen und gehen ma
Wichtiger mien Jung, merk das dir ohne Flachs
Die im Süden essen Stäbchen und wir essen Lachs""

Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature
Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature

Hier kommen deine Helden, der Tobi und Das Bo bitte melden
Yo hier kommt Disco wie Samstagnacht wie bei John Travolta
Holterdiepolter der Bass pumpt bis Obervolta
Hello peoples we are here in the one hand a micro

In the other a beer, we hear our music very loud
Hey girly, do you wanna be my Braut?
Nachtfieber, Nachtfieber hier bei uns im Norden uuh yeah
Immer wieder Nachtfieber, Nachtfieber hier bei uns im Norden, uuh yeah

Wir im Norden natürlich verführen dich discomanisch
Panische Tanzage voll in Rage
Bei unserer Trommelfellmassage, keine Blamage in dieser Passage
Denn die Discokugel Tobi-Tob läuft immer
Wenn ich am Mikro prob und der Laserdancer MK Bo
Stiehlt mir aber dann die Show

Bei uns Norddeutschen

Jja, ick weer in jungen Jahren an de Waterkant boorn
Moin! ne steife Brise von vorn gifft mi jümmer koole Ohrn
Ick gah jeedeen Avend up'n Swutsch
Un kumm erst trüch, wenn all mien Geld is futsch

Mann in de Tünn gah mi ut de Sünn
Ick bün wat ick bün kumm mi nich anne Plünn
Doch komm fixma rum um di de Norden antokieken
Bi uns dor is jümmer wat los achter de Dieken

Set di eerstmal dal nimm'n Kööm un'n Aal
Un smeckt di dat nich is mi dat ok schietegal
Du bist denn woll keen Schnimp
Wat nich heet dat ick nu schimp
Over pass op du Tüffel wi nehmt di op de Schüffel

Ich liebe die Schiffe, das Meer und den Hafen
Und ich liebe es, nach ner Party breit am Elbstrand einzuschlafen
Ich bin ein Hamburger Jung und ich komm voll in Schwung
Wenn ich hüpf und spring und von Hamburg sing

Samstagabend, n Kööm und n kühles Blondes
Und auf die Schnelle noch ne Fischfrikadelle
Schon Störtebeke wußte, dass der Norden rockt
Und hat mit seinem Kahn hier gleich angedockt

Ja ihr hört richtig heut ist Discozeit
Warum? weil alles nach Disco schreit
Und ihr fragt euch, ob der König das versprochene hält?
Ja na klar denn ich bin Nordisch by nature

Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature
Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature

Der Discobeat ist genau mein Ding
Weil ich ein Disco-Sixer bin
Oh ich sing Eißfeldt von der Waterkant
Schickt seine Disco Vibrations über das ganze Land

Ein Nordlicht wie ich ist nicht erpicht
Auf die Einhaltung von Regeln die irgendein Gericht ausspricht
Nein er bricht die Norm und die Gesetze gekonnt
Hier gibt es nur Flachland aber deshalb einen weiten Horizont

Nicht geboren auf Jamaika doch zu rollen mit der Zung
Ist n klacks für'n Hamburger Jung
Bede bey bey bede bey bey come follow me!
Ich trinke Holsten und ich liebe St. Pauli

Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature
Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature

Tanz mit mi, Marie

Yo Koze und Kozmic sind im Haus
Zieh die Hausschuhe aus und rein in die Dancing-Schuh'
We got another funky rap for you
From the south to the west to the east to the north

Come on fischmob go off an' go off an' go off an' go off
Hier kommt ein Rap im Kornfeld
Und wenn man nach vorn fällt
Weiß man der Korn hält was er verspricht

Wasser verspricht sich nicht
Denn Wasser kann nicht sprechen aber Dämme brechen
Dämme die Bechen unter den Futen der Nordsee
Und ich lauf weg wenn ich n mrd seh

""Lauf lauf"", ruft hinter mir mein Tainer
""Lauf du sollst noch aufnehmen bei die Jungs von Container""
Jetzt stehen wir hinter der Scheibe
Und halten bestimmt nicht den Schnabel

Es sei denn ihr zieht es raus das Mikrofonka
We got the fever
Samstagnachtfieber, Nachtfieber, Fieberthermometer
Samstagnachtfieber, Nachtfieber, Fieberthermometer

Nein hey MK Cram und lass mich jetzt mal anfangen
Nordisch by Nature verstehst du das?
An dem Mikrofon mit meinen worten bin ich echt schnell
Hörst du es schnellen, ich komm aus Deutschland

Hab nen akzent aber das macht nix aus
Ich bin trotzalledem ein ganzer Mann
Den du nicht kennst aber er rennt
Den ganzen Tag und die ganze Nacht wart noch nen Moment
Nordisch by Nature und ich wird euren Tag retten

Aale Aale alle Mann an die Mikrophone
Stemmt dem König seine Krone, gebt dem Renz mal n Flens
Und schiebt das Schiff auf n Riff
Ich bins der Ingeniör, schlängel mich so durchs Gewirr

Kabel ja auch so rum nä bin ja auch nicht dumm
Nä hab ne Klappe wie ne Krabbe und bin forsch wie n Dorsch
Eben Nordisch am Mixtisch
Blütenrein aprilfisch sind meine Ohrn

Denn ich bin ja auch geborn
Aufm Land joa und das stand joa auch im Klatschblatt
Meiner Heimatstadt Hamburg
Ja lach ruhich aber sach nix wenn ich abmix und dich austrix
Bin ich fix nur aufgrund meiner nordischen Natur

Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature
Nordisch, uh uh uhhh, Nordisch by nature

Wir sind nördlich, auch nicht nördlicher sondern am nördlichsten
Tabula Rasa, das ist der, der ich und der, der ich bin
Örtlich wortwörtlich definiert mit Flensburg
Ich hoffe es stört dich nicht wenn ich mal nach Hamburg gurk

Mit der Horke in der Hand stehn wir oft am Ostsee Sandstrand
Schauen auf die blauen grauen Wellen - bekanntes Land
Der Norden der Norden der Norden dreht auf
Pass auf wenn ich gleich übers Wasser lauf nicht absauf

Ja ick bin immer vorköhlt und ick höb anduernd Snöp
Snöö mir die Nase ut wenn de mal wedder dröpt
Denn wat mut dat mut, dat mut ja nun ma rut
Sowohl de Snöt als ok de dänische Sprachgebruck

Og nu fortsätter vi med de danske sprog
Vi to danske rim disco dannebro det ka'do tro
For vi liger syd for gränsen
Tabula Rasa vi er her og vi giver dig chancen

Nuancen gir' vi denne lille fede sang med vores uoverfräffelige Sprechgesang
Rimen flöd, ahhhh ku du märke dette stöd?
For det du lige sad og nöd ver det Fede Bröd

Fettes Brot,"Es ist wieder mal Samstagmorgen und ich wache plötzlich auf von einem Klingeln an der Tür, doch ich mach mir da nichts draus. Ich bleibe besser liegen, ist mir eigentlich auch egal, aber nach tausendmal klingeln hab ich keine andere Wahl. Vor der Tür steht 'n Mann mit 'nem grauen Kittel an, als er dann zu reden anfängt kann ich vage die Lage erkennen, denn er ist der Hausmeister und er sagt, wenn ich so ein' Lärm wie letzte Nacht noch einmal mach, hätte ich den letzten Tag in dieser Wohnung verbracht Er meckert, er kleckert nicht, er klotzt, er motzt, und ich hätte ihm fast vor seine Füße gekotzt. Trotz alledem redet er immmer noch, und es wird schlimmer doch, nachdem ich in mein Zimmer kroch, holt er eine Flasche aus der Tasche - einen Flachmann ?Prooost!"" - man versteht sich unter Nachbarn. Er leert den Schnaps mit einem Schwung. Er sagt, er könnte mich verstehen, er war ja auch mal jung. Ganz väterlich quält er mich mit einem Schwank aus seinem Leben. Das war zuviel für mich, ich muß mich übergeben - daneben...., dabei war die Party fett. Endlich ist der Kerl gegangen, und ich kann wieder ins Bett. Das war alles nicht so schlimm, ich nehm' es mit Humor, doch schläft es sich schlecht mit Frikadelle am Ohr.Baby, red' mir eine Frikadelle ans Ohr!
Oh, oh weia, was für eine Feier, war ja die Pest gestern nacht - erst um acht in der Heia. Naja, es ging ganz sutsche los: Um neun ging das Geknutsche los. An meinem Bier mich labend, freute ich mich auf den Abend. Ich steh am Büfett, wobe ich Chips aus meinem Mund pule: ?Hey - ist das nicht Fips aus meiner Grundschule!?!"" Cool ey, wir stoßen an auf alte Zeiten, leider läßt er sich dazu verleiten, Nichtigkeiten zu verbreiten. Zu gescheiten Kommentaren ist er offenbar nicht fähig und eh ich einschlafe dann geh ich lieber - fieberhaft überlege ich, auf welchem Wege ich diesen Mann wieder loswerden kann. Er fragt mich nach Aspirin - ma' sehen, vielleicht hab' ich noch Arsen für ihn. Er redet wie ein Labersack - nicht gerade interessant, dafür aber Schabernack - ohne Sinn und Verstand. Ich hasse Leute, die nicht merken, wenn sie nerven, nur mit Dichtungen von eigenen Werken um sich werfen. Noch einen Mucks und ich schicke ihn flugs mit dem Fluxkompensator zurück in die Vergangenheit wie Michael J. Fox. Der Typ ist doch dicht wie Fort Knox. Hört nicht auf zu texten. Ich merke schon, mir wächst'n Kropf am Kopf. Mann, ich bin herbivor - ich eß kein Fleisch, nimm das Hack aus meinem Ohr!
Baby, red' mir eine Frikadelle ans Ohr!
Ich sitz grad' beim Mittagessen, eß 'n leckeres Gericht. es klingelt laut an der Tür und ich erschrecke mich. Mittagessen in den Augen, richtig sehen kann ich nicht, mach die Tür auf, jemand drückt mir eine Bibel ins Gesicht. ""Hallo, mein Sohn. Ich wollte mit Dir über Gott sprechen!"" Und an dieser Stelle wollt' ich das Gespräch abbrechen, doch der Typ redet weiter über Sein, über Schein, die Mundwinkel voller Schleim. Oh nein! Er kommt rein! ""Sex vor der Ehe, das ist Sünde mein Sohn. do sollst Deine Unschuld bis zur Hochzeitsnacht schonen!"" Er zeigt mir Bücher, bunte Bilder mit bibeltreuen Brüdern. Und er sagt zu mir: ""Mein Sohn, willst do überleben, mußt do mir etwas geben und Gebete reden."" Er redet über Engel, über Himmel, über Erde. Er redet über Frieden und wie ich erlöst werde. Er lächelt mich an und sagt, wie glücklich er ist, und mir wird klar, der Typ heißt Schmidt und ist Christ. Und er redet und er redet und er redet und er redet und er redet und er liest mir etwas vor. Und weil er redet, weil er redet, weil er redet, weil er redet, wächst mir 'ne Frikadelle am Ohr. Und aufgrund dieser Frikadelle hör ich ihn seit Stunden nicht, doch er redet und er redet und er redet und er redet. Er redet und ich werde ohnmächtig...
Baby, red' mir eine Frikadelle ans Ohr!

Fettes Brot,"Ich weiß, dass du dich schon lange nicht mehr nach draußen traust
Manchmal schaust du hinaus, während du Kaugummi kaust
Und du glaubst, du bist raus aus all dem saus und braus
Bis eine Stimme dir sagt, 'zieh die Hausschuh aus'
Schnapp dir Papis wagen, lass uns die Karre starten
Die Knarre laden und heute Abend auf die Barrikaden
Nur du und ich kommen als Rächer über Deutschlands Dächer
Bringen die Wahrheit ans Licht wie'n freudscher versprecher
Warum ich früher selber das Maul hielt?
Vermutlich war ich zufrieden, weil ich es anders nicht kannte
Heute weiß ich, wer alles foul spielt
Und hab mehr ja-sager gesehen als jeder verdammte Standesbeamte
Ich treff sie auf der Straße und in der S-bahn
Die Ärztin, den koch, die Lehrerin und den Geschäftsmann
Und abertausende brüten in ihren Nestern
Haben heut schon angst vor morgen und klammern sich fest an gestern
Brüder und Schwestern leiht mir eure Ohren, fühl mich wie Neugeboren
Hab Hiphop die Treue geschworen, die letzte scheu verloren
Ich kack diesen Spinnern vor die Tür, leg 'ne Bildzeitung drauf
Zünde sie an und läute Sturm Scheiße, ah

Hallo, yippieyo, schüttelt den Po, rockt ohne Ende
Schreit ho, genauso, bei dieser Show wackeln die Wände
Mikro, MK 2 und Lichterloh legen wir brände achso, 
Apropos, ey bitte wo sind eure Hände?

Jeder schritt den ich mach wird videoüberwacht
Ihr glaubt, wir merken das nicht ich hab noch nie so gelacht
Zivicops, Kameras und Lauschangriff
Das macht ihr sicher nicht für mich, denn ich brauch das nicht
Ihr wollt für jeden Scheiß Genehmigung, wegen irgendeiner Regelung
Dabei zieh ich hier mit meinen Kollegen bloß in der Gegend rum
Das auch weiterhin, auch wenn es euch nicht in den Kram passt
Guck genau, was ihr macht, mit dem Blick eines Adlers
Denn ich weiß auch, ihr Typen bringt derbe linke Dinger
Doch ich scheiß drauf, bin wütend zeig euch gern den Stinkefinger
Ihr kommt auf unsere Partys, auch wenn euch niemand gebeten hat
Guckt, wer wieder da ist und ich denk, was geht denn ab
Sagt mal, wovor habt ihr Angst? dass wir untertauchen?
Ihr wollt uns kontrollieren und für dumm verkaufen
Und so lebe ich jeden Tag mit meinem wissen über Deutschland
Doch zum Glück bin ich gerissen, wie ein Kreuzband

Wir segeln wie Piraten unter der Totenkopfflagge
Linken sie im privaten mit unsrer dopen pop-platte
Wie Störtebeker tun wir's weder für König noch für Vaterland
Und ihr habt grad erkannt, wie gewöhnlich an der Waterkant
Herrscht hier ein rauer Wind, doch hörst du genauer hin
Merkt sogar jedes Bauernkind, dass wir sehr viel schlauer sind
Wir lassen uns nicht einfach so verarschen
Nicht von Tresenpolitikern, oder Führungsetagen
Da wir in unserem Lande noch so einiges zu ändern haben
Wechseln wir den Sendeplan für die ganze Bord
Denn Politik läuft mit Intrigen wie bei Denver- Clan
Wen interessieren spendernamen, wenn ich euch ans leder geh
Diese pisser lass ich am Klostein lecken
Ich mach's echt wie Kirschsaft oder Rotweinflecken
Wenn wir für die deutsche Wirtschaft den nächsten dopen Rhyme checken
Und dann den scheiß Reichstag im Mondschein taggen
Ein riesen Medienhype für die üblichen verdächtigen
Nach ein wenig Zeit einigt man sich gütlich mit den mächtigen
Ihr wollt uns nur bescheißen und ihr lügt, wenn ihr sprecht

Dich einzureihen und nicht aufzufallen
Jetzt ist es an der zeit sich mal aufzubäumen
Draufzuhauen und die Scheisse endlich rauszuschreien

Also mach Platz, bitte aus dem Weg Mann
Wir reissen das Maul auf bevor wir überlegt haben
Wir springen euch mit dem nackten Arsch ins Gesicht
Ihr sagt, ""Vielen Dank"", ich sag, ""Ach dafür nich’""

Wer ist das wohl der am Lautstärkeknopf dreht

Also hebt eure Hände in die Luft wenn
Ihr wollt dass ich hier diesen Spinner rauswerfen
Denn er meint ja genug sei genug und
Ab 22 Uhr nur noch Zimmerlautstärke

Wo bitte sehr kommen die Vorschriften

Alles steht in Flammen und wir lassen es brennen
Wir wollen Rabatz saufen Schnaps und zwar kalt und klar

Fettes Brot,"Moin moin - was geht?
Alles klar bei dir? Wie spät?
Gleich neun - okay.
Will mal eben los, Frühstück holen gehn
Schalt den Walkman an, zieh die Haustür ran
Lauf die Straße entlang bis zum Kaufmannsladen
Denn da gibt's die allerbesten Brötchen weit und breit
Kann am Tresen kurz mal lesen was die Zeitung schreibt
Irgendwas von nem Großangriff
Unzählige Bomben auf kleine Stadt
Viele Menschen ums Leben gekommen
Und dem Erdboden gleich gemacht in nur einer Nacht
Ich zahle und verlasse den Bäcker
Hör noch den Nachrichtensprecher
""Lage wieder mal dramatisch verschlechtert, heute fantastisches Wetter""
Plötzlich gibt's 'n Knall, tausend Scherben überall
Die Nachbarskatze hat's erwischt bei 'nem Verkehrsunfall
Der Anblick kann einem echt die Laune verderben
Was fällt diesem Mistvieh ein hier genau vor meinen Augen zu sterben?

Refrain:
Absolute Wahnsinnsshow
I'm Fernsehen und I'm Radio
Die Sonne lacht so schadenfroh
An Tagen wie diesen
Niemand der mir sagt, wieso
Beim Frühstück oder Abendbrot
Die Fragen bohren so gnadenlos
An Tagen wie diesen

Eine Million bedroht vom Hungertod nach Schätzungen der UNICEF
Während ich grad gesundes Obst zerhäcksel in der Mulinex
Seh ein Kind in dessen traurigen Augen ne Fliege sitzt
Weiß dass das echt grausam ist doch scheiße Mann ich fühle nix
Was ist denn bloß los mit mir, verdammt wie ist das möglich?
Vielleicht hab ich's schon zu oft gesehen man sieht's ja beinah täglich
Doch warum kann mich mittlerweile nicht mal das mehr erschrecken
Wenn irgendwo Menschen an dreckigem Wasser verrecken?
Dieses dumpfe Gefühl, diese Leere I'm Kopf
Sowas kann uns nie passieren und was wäre wenn doch?
Und mich zerreißen die Fragen, ich kann den Scheiß nicht ertragen
Die haben da nix mehr zu Fressen und ich hab Steine I'm Magen!

Refrain

Was hat er gerade gesagt an so nem normalen Samstag
Passiert auf bestialische Art ein ganz brutaler Anschlag
Bei dem sechs Leute starben, die Verletzten schreien Namen
Diese entsetzlichen Taten lassen mich jetzt nicht mehr schlafen
Und ich seh's noch genau das Bild I'm TV
Ein junger Mann steht dort I'm Staub
Fleht um Kind und Frau
Jetzt frag ich mich wie ist es wohl wenn man sein Kind verliert
Noch bevor es seinen ersten Geburtstag hat
Doch das übersteigt meine Vorstellungskraft
Vielleicht waren die Attentäter voller Hass für den Gegner
Vielleicht gab es Liebe für Familie und sie waren sogar selber Väter.
Manchmal wenn ich Nachrichten seh passiert mit mir etwas Seltsames
Denn auch wir sind Eltern jetzt,
Haben ein Kind in diese Welt gesetzt
Dann kommt es vor dass ich Angst davor krieg, dass uns etwas geschieht,
Dass man den verliert den man liebt, dass es das wirklich gibt
Mitten in der Nacht word ich wach und bin schweißgebadet,
Schleich ans Bett meiner Tochter und hör wie sie ganz leise atmet

Refrain

Was für ne Wahnsinnsshow
I'm Fernsehn und I'm Radio
Die Sonne lacht dabei so schadenfroh
Ich word die Bilder nicht mehr los
Beim Frühstück und beim Abendbrot
Niemand der mir sagen kann, wieso.

Fettes Brot,"Es ist Neunzehn-sechsundneunzig
Meine Freundin ist weg und bräunt sich
In der Südsee, allein?
Ja, mein Budget war klein
Na fein, herein, willkommen im Verein

Ich wette, heute machen wir erneute fette Beute
Treffen seute Bräute und lauter nette Leute
Warum dauernd trauern?
Wow, schaut euch diese Frau an
Schande, dazu bist du imstande?

Kaum ist deine Herzallerliebste aus dem Lande
Und du Hengst denkst längst an 'ne Andere
Was soll ich denn heulen, ihr wisst, dass ich meiner Freundin treu bin
Ich bin brav, aber ich traf eben my first love

Ich darf zwar nur im Schlaf
Doch auf sie war ich schon immer scharf
Habt ihr den Blick geahnt
Den sie mir eben durchs Zimmer warf
Oh mein Gott, wat hat der Trottel Sott
What a Pretty Woman, das Glück is' mit die Dummen

Wenn ich die stummen Blicke schicke,
Sie wie Rummenigge kicke, meint ihr checkt sie das?
Du bist durchschaubar wie Plexiglas
Uh, sie kommt auf dich zu
Na Kleiner, hast du Bock auf Schweinereien?
Ja klar, äh nein, ich mein jein

Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?
Jein
Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?

Ich habe einen Freund, ein guter? 
Sozusagen mein bester
Und ich habe ein Problem, ich steh auf seine Freundin 
Nicht auf seine Schwester?
Würd ich auf die Schwester steh'n, hätt' ich nicht das Problem
Das wir haben, wenn er, sie und ich uns sehen

Kommt sie in den Raum, wird mir schwindelig
Sag ich, sie will nichts von mir, dann schwindel ich
Ich will sie, sie will mich, das weiß sie, das weiß ich
Nur mein bester Freund, der weiß es nich

Und somit sitz ich sozusagen in der Zwickmühle
Und das ist auch der Grund, warum ich mich vom Schicksal gefickt fühle
Warum hat er die schönste Frau zur Frau?
Mit dem schönsten Körperbau
Und ist sie schlau, genau

Es steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen, wenn man sieht
Was mit mir passiert und was mit mir geschieht
Es erscheinen Engelchen und Teufelchen auf meiner Schulter
Engel links, Teufel rechts, lechz

Nimm dir die Frau, sie will es doch auch
Kannst du mir erklären, wozu man gute Freunde braucht?
Halt, der will dich linken"", schreit der Engel von der Linken
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas scheiße ist und Lügner stinken?

Und so streiten sich die beiden um mein Gewissen
Und ob ihr's glaubt oder nicht, mir geht es echt beschissen
Und während sich der Teufel und der Engel anschreien
Entscheide ich mich für ja, nein, ich mein jein

Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?
J nein
Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?

Ich schätz' jetzt bin ich der Solist in unserem Knabenchor
Ey Schiff, was hast'n heute Abend vor?
Hm, ich mach hier nur noch meine Strophe fertig
Pack meine sieben Sachen und dann werd ich

Mich zu meiner Freundin begeben, denn wenn man ehrlich gesteht
Sind solche netten, ruhigen Abende eher spärlich gesät
Aha, und dabei biste eingeladen
Auf das beste aller Feste auf der Gästeliste eingetragen

Und wenn du nicht mitkommst dann hast du echt was verpasst
Und wen wundert's, es wird fast die Party des Jahrhunderts
Ähm, Lust hätt ich ja eigentlich schon
Oh, es klingelt just das Telefon, hallo?

Und sie sacht, es wär schön, wenn du bei mir bleibst
Heut Nacht, ich dacht' das wär abgemacht?

Wisst ihr, ich liebe diese Frau und deswegen
Komm ich von der Traufe in den Regen
Na was ist nun Schiffmeister, kommst du mit, du Kollegenschwein
Ja, äähh nein, ich mein jein

Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?
Äh Jein
Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?
Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?
Soll ich's wirklich machen oder lass ich's lieber sein?",Jein

Hört man nur die Knochen knacken.
Eure Mama muss für euch ma Kuchen backen!

Und I'm Winter hält er warm. (Schön!)
Wovon ich hier rede ist ein riesengroßer Arsch.
Mein Rotwein und dein Popo passen großartig zusamm',
Denn wenn ich dein Hintern seh denk ich der Mond is aufgegangen!

Alle Leute aus der Gegend sind sich derbe am bewegen,
Und die Klamotten kleben so richtig geil!
Alles tanzt man kommt sich näher.
Ich mach dick hier ein auf Player
Und reib mich an deinem Hinterteil!

Wenn wir uns hier und jetzt in eure Herzen singen.
Ja wir stehn da drauf und wir lieben es,
Wenn Girls zu diesem Track ihre Ärsche schwingen!

Fey,"Mientras hay camino
Sobran sitios dónde ir
Deja que el destino
Lo decida por ti

Abre las ventanas
De la imaginación
Pon en hora
El reloj del corazón

Que gota tras gota
Despacio va llenándose el río
De la amistad gota tras gota
Antes o después te vas a llenar
Tú también

Iye, Iye, Iye

Que haces aparcado
Fuera de la circulación
Mientras que la vida
Hierve a tu alrededor

Lo bueno y lo malo
Sigue un mismo patrón
Tienes que ser parte
Nunca espectador

You turned your back, now you're going swimming

And I don't know what to do
I don't know where to find my way back to the truth

Of how life used to be
Cause the face in the mirror isn't looking too familiar


I can say that I used to know a lot about you
But it seems I've fallen from you
And I can say that I need to know more about you
So now I'm on my knees singing


(Chorus)


Breathe in me
I fall so easily
How can it be
That you would rescue me
So Breathe in me
Breathe in me


The time I have wasted
Is not just my own
I got to get back to You, I gotta find my way home
Before my world comes tumbling down
The longer I wait
It gets harder to turn around
To see your eyes staring right through my soul
Oh but I know
That life begins when I die again and surrender


(Repeat Chorus)


I can hear you calling to me
I can see you reaching for me
Offering your hand to guide me
Hold me close again and set me free

I can say that I need to know more about you.

Wanting to find release from the empty spaces
So I pack my bags and set out
Following traces of a better day


So I walk a thousand miles in the wrong direction
Building callous on my feet and a fine collection
Of wasted days and foolish ways
And baggage that I've picked up along the way


Then I hear a familiar voice calling me home
It's loves voice so I make the choice
To turn and follow


(Chorus)


And I fall to you
And you see through
All the foolish games I play
And I cast my cares away
And I fall to you
And I know you'll do
The same thing today
That you did every other day
When I went away


Trying to find the way with my own eye
It's like trying to find the sun in a midnight sky
The more I carry on alone
The harder it is to get by on my own


Then I see you standing there calling me home
So I throw down all my bags
And run straight to your arms

On the edge of the ledge

When I call, You're quick to answer me
And when I weep, You will weep with me

When I hunger, You are the bread for me
When I kneel, you already heard me

You're always there for me

When I fell, You were there, You saw it all

Like swimming upstream
Or going against the grain

Oh but as for me I choose to be 
As happy as I can be

Trouble may find me 
But it's not gonna keep me down
'Cause I'll hold on tight
To the Father who loves me 
And likes having me around
'Cause He loves me, and He cares for me,
And so I'll be alright


We go round and round
Back and forth and almost upside down
To buy who we are -
A great big house, nice jeans, and a shiny car
But I'm learning that this world keeps turning 
With or without me
So I'll do my best and leave the rest 
To the one watching over me

You open up the door and I just turn away
Walk the other way
You offer so much more
Than I could ever ask for
But I say thanks anyway
I go on and on alone
Make believing I can make it on my own


(Chorus)


I think it's time for me to make a change
And start walking back to you
Before I go so far away
That I can't hardly see you
Reaching out, 
Calling the prodigal I said I'd never be
Now what I need is a little change


I've played the game before
But now the game is 
Taking more than I can give
And I'm dying to give in
But you're holding out for me
But what you're holding out for me
I can barely see
Because my visions' so dim
I try, but I can only hardly recognize
This light that should be blinding my eyes.

One of these days I'm gonna do

And I'm gonna see a million faces

One of these days
Gonna see the hand 
That took the nails from me
One of these days
Gonna hold the key to 
The mansion built for me
One of these days
Gonna walk the streets of 
Gold that were paved for me
One of these days
I'm gonna see my Savior face to face
One of these days

One of these days I'm gonna say
Just what became of me
On the day that I believed
When you took myself from me
And I believe I will say
What I would have been
If You didn't save me
One of these days

And one of these days I'm gonna talk
With all the saints that have gone before
And in their sandals I will walk
And we will sit upon the shore
And I will learn all the things
That I never knew before
All this and more

One of these days I'll finally be
In a place where there's no more need
No more pain and no more grief
No more foolish disbelief
And all the joy there will be
When at last we finally see
One of these days",One of These Days
FFH,"What can I say to make you understand
All the things I do
And the way they fit in the Master's plan
What can I say to you to make you not ask why

I can't forget no matter how hard I try
'Cause the world keeps on spinning 'round and 'round
And it seems you're spinning upside down


Chorus:
Only You can save my soul
And only You can make me whole again
Only You can see the need in me
And fill the need completely


What can I say tonight to erase all the doubt
To brighten up your eyes
To show you what love is all about
What can I say tonight to crack the ice
To make you realize
That I can see through your disguise
'Cause the world keeps on spinning 'round and 'round
And it seems you're spinning upside down

You could never run too far away
From the One who formed you with His hand
He's calling you to take His hand again.

Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand

Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
Sufficient and full there's power in His blood
His love is all we need
There's joy in the spirit of the Lord


You are the one who has made me complete
Now I'm kneeling at your feet
Knowing only you can lead me home
I'll stand through it all
Waiting on Your call
Knowing that you hear my every prayer

And I know I'll find my love in His arms

FFH,"I've had my share of heartache
I've felt the sting of pain
From standing out in the desert
Praying for rain
I,ve seen my lonely teardrops
Fall down my lonely face
Oh how I long to hear the
Thunder roll again

And I want to be 
Swept away in Thee
Only You know what I need

(Chorus)
So open up the sky
Rain down Your love
I don't care if I
Never get enough
I just want to be
Caught in that flood
So open up the sky

I've had my disappointments
I've cried a time or two
These showers of love I long for 
They only come from You
Now I want to go deeper
And fall in over my head
So send Your Holy downpour
And let the healing begin

And I can't wait
To be swept away
Only You can stop the pain

(Repeat Chorus)

I just want to be
Caught in that flood
So open up the sky

Where could I go where You are not
Where could I be where You don't see

What kind of sin could I find myself in
Where You wouldn't stop
The world from spinning 'round and 'round
When it seems like I am upside down
But in Your comfort I have found
A safe place to fall

And I'll be alright
Safe inside
Stayin' alive
As long as You are watching over me

Where could I go where I don't know
All of the comfort You bestow
Where could I fall, where could I land
Where I'm not resting in Your hand
How could I stray too far away
Where You won't leave the ninety-nine
To come and bring me back
And put me on Your shoulders and
Carry me around Your neck
Until it's safe to walk

To put my arms around you and be swept away

Beautiful under this
Wonderful amazing sky
That I'm sure the Lord made just for you

Ever dream about

A dream come true from a wishing well
A million things so I can't tell
Just another day with you

Or the way you toss back that blond hair

FFH,"Voices are everywhere, and they?re screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me. We?ve got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times. You can?t do it. You can?t do it on your own. You?re not smart enough. You?re not strong enough. You?re not stable enough. You?re not thin enough. And then there?s the enemy. The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you?ll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago. He?s a great man. I love him so much. And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him. My dad had just put a room onto his house. And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad?s work. And he got done and went to my dad, and said, ?That?s a good job Harry.? And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice. Without hearing that, whether it?s the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don?t have any identity. You have no way to function. I think Jesus knew that. I think that?s why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people. He never asked them to be anything that they weren?t. He tried to get them to understand who they were. That?s why he said, ?You?re my daughter, you?re my son, you?re my brother, you?re my sheep.? He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we?re His creation; that we're worth something.

Yeah, and that?s something amazing about Jesus. He could look down into somebody?s spirit and draw out who they really were. I mean, he looked at Simon and said, ?You know what? You?re not Simon, You?re Peter. You?re a Rock.?

And how ?bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, ?Daughter.? His first word: Daughter. 

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father. Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke. I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn?t inward. Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it. Like at His baptism, God the father said, ?you are my son, I love you and I?m pleased with you.? And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it. The father said, ?You are my son. I have chosen you, and God just established Christ?s purpose on that mountain.? And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour? No. This is why I?ve come. Glorify your name father. And the father spoke and said, ?I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.? And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross. 

I think it did too. You may have never heard that voice. That voice that says you?re worth it. You?re smart enough. I believe in you. I love you. There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it?s just a vacuum. Listen, Jesus doesn?t require anything of you. You can?t work to get His approval. Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, ?This is my son who I love.? Jesus hadn?t done a single miracle. All he asks of you is that you listen.

How they walked away
Left you standing there

I'm about to bring back what was lost

Out of affliction from the hands of our oppressors

When I'm weak You are strong

You are near and I'm right where I belong

Until Your voice like manna from the sky falls
I will worship in the waiting
I will walk with this sand beneath my feet
Though the winter wind is blowing

The ground is not frozen underneath
I will worship and not grow bitter
'Cause I know You see the end of it all
And with the spring will come the rain
And I'll see what was gained

In the waiting
I've seen the blooms of spring, new life in everything
But now it seems so grey, bright colors fade away
This winter seems much longer and colder than before
But I will worship in the waiting, expecting something more
Until the sun shines warm upon my face again

He Leadeth me, He leadeth me
By His own hand, He leadeth me
His faithful follower I would be
For by His hand, He leadeth me

No matter what this life can give, 
I know my heart was made to live for One,
It wasn't made for two

Lord, let me drop everything and answer You..

Yes Lord, You are, You are, my One and Only (2x)
Nah nah nah nah nah...

That You look past all the flaws in me
You see through the outside part,
To the motives of my heart
There is nothing I can't hide

So come and take away
Every thought that disobeys
Until my response to You is truthfully.. this.. (Chorus)

That You are a jealous God
Then my heart will truly say... (Chorus 2x)",One and Only

I’m asking please, but I can see in your eyes
You don’t need tears for alibis

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire, to face unafraid
The plans that we've made

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance

And do you have faith in God above

And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

I'm pretty sure it rained the day I died.
I think it rained, I think it rained.
I'm pretty sure it rained the day I died.

You and I were always closest friends.
It's women that make enemies of men.
A pretty face, A pretty face.
A pretty face would one day do me in.

Her eyes are like the winter when she goes.
Holding secrets only winter knows.
Winters, Winter knows.
Cause winter's seen the wolves in woman's clothes.

She came to me and made the laughter new.
We held each other close the whole might through.
Love is blind, Love went blind.
I didn't see her let you in the room.

A gunshot was the only word she said.
And all of my defenses came out red.
Love went red, Love went red.
She left me for you, Left me lying dead.

She had my wallet tucked inside her skirt.

Amd what is there to say that if they all lay down
My home would be gone

I wanna put glue down your gun

And there'll be no invasion

To make the same mistakes

I drew my last breath
I couldn't tell her I loved her

Took a double dose of a deadly drug

As I came in by Achindoon just a wee bit from the town, 
To the Highlands I was bound to view the haughs of Cromdale 
I met a man in tartan trews, I spiered at him what was the news 
Says he: ""The Highland army rues that ever we came to Cromdale"" 

Highland Man: 
""We were in bed, sir, every man, when the English host upon us came 
A bloody battle then began upon the haughs of Cromdale 
The English horse they were so rude, 
they bathed their hoofs in Highland blood 
But every clan so boldly stood upon the haughs of Cromdale"" 

""But alas we could no longer stay for over the hills we came away 
And sore we do lament the day that ever we came to Cromdale"" 
Thus the great Montrose did say: "" Highland man, show me the way! 
For I will over the hills this day and I'll view the haughs of Cromdale"" 

Highland Man: 
""But alas my Lord you're not so strong, 
you scarcely have two thousand man 
There's twenty thousand on the plain 
stand rank and file on Cromdale"" 
Thus the great Montrose did say: ""Highland man, show me the way! 
For I will over the hills this day and I'll view the haughs of Cromdale"" 

Narrator: 
They were at dinner, every man when the great Montrose upon them came 
A second battle then began upon the haughs of Cromdale 
The Grant, Mackenzie and M'ky, soon as Montrose they did espy 
Oh then they fought most valiantly upon the haughs Of Cromdale 

The McDonalds they returned again, the Camerons did their their standard join, 
Macintosh played a bloody game upon the haughs Of Cromdale 
The MacGregors fought like lions bold, MacPhersons none could them control, 
MacLoughlins fought like loyal souls upon the haughs Of Cromdale 

Survivor: 
""Well, I don't care who's wrong or right 
cause men will die in any fight 
Can't stand the clashing of the swords upon the haughs of Cromdale 
Every night I see the dead, the corpses still inside my head 
Can't find no peace cause blood was shed 
There on the haughs of Cromdale""",Haughs of Cromdale

We felt the water on our skin 
But then the light grew dim 
And in the flickering twilight 
We felt the shadow of fear

She bid me take life easy, as the leaves that grow on every tree 
But I was young and foolish 
With her would not agree

Fiddler's Green,"A holiday, a holiday, 
The first one of the year 
Lord Arnold's wife came into the church, 
The gospel for to hear 

And when the meeting it was done, 
She cast her eyes about 
And there she saw little Matty Groves 
Walking in the crowd 

""Come home with me, little Matty Groves 
Come home with me tonight 
Come home with me, little Matty Groves 
And sleep with me till light!"" 

""Oh I can't come home and I won't go home 
And sleep with you tonight 
By the rings on your fingers I can see 
That you are my master's wife."" 

And what if I am Lord Arnold's wife 
For he is not at home 
He is out in the far cornfields 
Bringing the yearlings home 

So little Matty Groves, he lay down 
And took a little sleep 
When he awoke Lord Arnold 
He was standing by his feet 

Saying, ""How do you like my feather bed 
And how do you like my sheets? 
How do you like my lady wife 
Who lies in your arms asleep?"" 

Oh well, I like your feather bed 
Better I like your sheets 
Best of all I like your lady gay 
Who lies in my arms asleep 

""Get up. get up"", Lord Arnold cried, 
Get up as quick as you can 
Let it never be said in fair England 
That I slew a naked man"" 

""Oh I won't get up, and I won't get up 
I can't get up for my life 
For you have two long beaten swords 
And I not a pocket knife"" 

""Well it's true I have two beaten swords 
And they cost me deep in the purse 
But you will have the better of them 
And I will have the worse"" 

So Matty struck the very first blow 
And he hurt Lord Arnold sore 
Lord Arnold struck the very next blow 
And Matty struck the floor 

And then he took his own dear wife 
And sat her down on his knee 
Saying, ""who do you like the best of us now 
Your Matty Groves or me?"" 

And then spoke up his own dear wife 
Never heard her speak so free 
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips 
Than you or your finery"" 

And then Lord Arnold he jumped up 
And loudly did he bawl 
He struck his wife right through the heart 
And he pinned her up to the wall 

""Oh, a grave, a grave"", Lord Arnold cried 
To put these lovers in 
Won't you bury my lady at the top 
For she was a noble kin.",Matty Groves

He was only passing through, somehow feeling blue 
So many faces he had met and left without regret 
Still waiting for the chimes to ring and his soul to sing 

He found a pub where he could play, only for one night 
When suddenly he saw her eyes, desire at first sight 

Shot in the dark 
One step away from me 

And when he saw her pretty face, it was a castle in the clouds 
His aching heart was burning now and he felt no doubts 
He didn't dare to talk to her and so he fiddled for the crowd 
She stood first row in front of him his eyes were shining proudly 

He played a lovely fiddle tune and swept her off her feet 
And while he looked into her eyes his heart began to beat 
Collywobbles and the creeps, he went straight to the bar 
And when he had a lot of pints he sang Whiskey in the jar 

She drives him round the twist 
And now he can't resist 
Drunk as a fiddler's bitch 
And so he goes to make his stitch",Shot in the Dark

From a boreen green came a sweet Colleen

To the sheen of her nut-brown hair. 
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself 
For so see I was really there.

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay 
And from Galway to Dublin town, 
No maid I've seen like the fair colleen 
That I met in the County Down. 

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head 
And I looked with a feeling rare. 
And I say, say's I, to a passer - by, 
""Who's the maid with the nut - brown hair""? 
He smiled at me and he say's, say's he, 
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown. 
Young Rosie McCann, from the banks of the ban 
She's the star of the County Down."" 

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there 
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes, 
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right 
For a smile from my nut brown rose.

Fiddler's Green,"I see it clearly now the way is quite uncertain
It seems to vanish in the haze
I've got a brainwave now
There is no final curtain
I'll be the master of my days

Won't you ask me another one
So where am I going
Sometimes I'm losing my way
Won't you ask me another one
What am I doing
I am a little confused

All that she wants is a little love from me
All that she needs is a little loving

I'll do it my way or
No way at all

I'm getting nowhere fast
I'm losing my direction
But I pretend that I'm strong
I listen to the words
That seem to be my own ones
I frown when I hear my voice

I'll do it my way
I am as stubborn as a goat
I'll do it my way and it might be wrong
This is my way
Come on and help me sing this song

My way",My Way
Fiddler's Green,"The Diamond is a ship me lads
For the Davis Straits she's bound
And the Quay it is all garnished
With bonnie lassies round
Captain Thompson gives the order
To sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets me lads
Nor darkness dims the sky

[Chorus]
And it's cheer up, me lads
Let your hearts never fail
For the bonnie ship The Diamond
Goes a-fishing for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead
The lassies stand around
Wi' their shawls all pulled about them
And the salt tears runnin' down
Oh don't you weep, my bonnie lass
Though you be left behind
For the rose will grow on Greenland's ice
Before we change our mind

Here's a health to The Resolution
Likewise the Eliza Swan
Here's a health to the Battler of Montrose
And The Diamond ship of fame
We wear the trousers of the white
And the jackets of the blue
When we return to Peterhead
We'll have sweethearts anoo",Bonnie Ship the Diamond
Fiddler's Green,"[Chorus]
Well we're good old boys, we come from the Northern Shore
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen
And this night by God! We drank â??til there was no more 
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between.

But Iit all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the fall
So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl

[Chorus]

We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare
So Wwe left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise

[Chorus]

Spirits they ran high that night old stories we did share
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care
The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty bye and bye

[Chorus]

Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queens Cross
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost
For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes began to rove
So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove

[Chorus]

We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call
The final destination of this the first annual crawl
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound

[Chorus]",The Crawl
FiddleSticks,"Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee
Even thought it be a cross
That raiseth me 
Still all my song shall be
Nearer my God to thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee

Though like the wanderer 
The sun gone down
Darkness be over me
My rest a stone 
Yet in my dreams I'd be 
Nearer my God to thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee

There let the way appear
Step unto heaven 
All that thou sendest me 
In mercy given
Angles to beckon me 
Nearer my God to thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee

Then with my walking thoughts
Bright with thy praise
Out of the stony greifs 
Bethel I'll raise
So by my woes to be 
Nearer my God to thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee

Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky
Sun, moon, and stars forgot
Upward I fly
Still all my song shall be 
Nearer my God to thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee",Nearer My God to Thee

Lead thou me on the night is dark 
And I am far from home lead thou me on 
Keep thou my feet I don not ask to see
The distant scene one step enough for me

I was not ever thus of prayed that thou
Should lead me on I love to choose 
And see my path But now lead thou me on
I loved the garish day and spite of fears 
Pride ruled my will remember not past years  

So long thy power hath blessed me sure it still
Will lead me on over moor and fen 
Over crag and torrent ‘till the night is gone 
And with the morn those angle faces smile
Which I have loved long since and lost a while",Lead Kindly Light
Fiddlin' Doc Roberts,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

And I got mine

Fiddlin' John Carson,"I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
When you and i were young long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill has decayed, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
signs of life nearly gone
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

And now we are aged and grey, Maggie
The trials of life nearly done
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie
When you and I were young.

Fiddlin' John Carson,"A little maiden climbed an old man's knees—

Begged for a story: ""Do uncle, please! 

Why are you single, why live alone?

Have you no babies, have you no home?"" 

""I had a sweetheart, years, years ago, 

Where she is now, pet, you will soon know; 

List to the story, I'll tell it all: 

I believed her faithless after the ball.“

”Bright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom,

Softly the music playing sweet tunes. 

There came my sweetheart, my love, my own,

‘I wish some water; leave me alone.'

When I returned, dear, there stood a man 

Kissing my sweetheart as lovers can. 

Down fell the glass, pet, broken, that's all—

Just as my heart was after the ball.“

”Long years have passed, child, I have never wed, 

True to my lost love though she is dead. 

She tried to tell me, tried to explain—

I would not listen, pleadings were vain. 

One day a letter came from that man; 

He was her brother, the letter ran. 

That's why I'm lonely, no home at all—

I broke her heart, pet, after the ball.""

Chorus: 

After the ball is over, after the break of morn, 

After the dancers' leaving, after the stars are gone, 

Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all—

Source: Many the hopes that have vanished after the ball.

Cuando solo en mi vida había tribulación 
No había alegría en mi corazón

No me dejo solo en esta transición

Me acuerdo de días de perdición 
Cuando no había sentido ni había dirección 
Yo se que a mucha gente le da inspiración 
Escuchar algo nuevo en la estación de radio 
Así que ya no aflojes que falta un montón 
Hay que demostralo completar nuestra misión 

Hablar por hablar esa no es la cuestión 
Ni cantar por cantarlo sin noción 
Abrazarte a la vida 
Acordarte cuando estamos tirados sin comida 
No había nadie que te cure tus heridas 
Todo parecía una calle sin salida 
Te dejaban solo las personas que querías 
Como salir de todo esto no sabias 
Hasta que escuchaste esta melodía 
Te reconforto y te trajo alegría 
Y armonía 

Gracias amigos, gracias enemigos 
Por que sus pensamientos siempre 
Están conmigo 
No me molesta tener contrincantes 
Así cuando entreno yo puedo inspirarme 
Tampoco yo quiero destruir a nadie 
Vine a construir y a edificarme 
No me mal entiendan no se mal acostumbren 
Gracias a la gente llegamos a la cumbre emocionado!

And when I toss it, I ain't gon' lie, I raw dog it
'Cause she's so jazzy, every five minutes I stop and tell her
Bitches playa hate because they not, they jealous

Long micros with lots of cheddar
Givin' me more D's than Jay Z, she'll Roc A Fella
Classy, I gots to say it in a capella
So y'all rats can hear me clear, y'all gots to do better

I need a jazzy bitch, a classy bitch
Walkin' and pass me the switch, flashin' her wrist

If you feel that you's a jazzy nigga, you feel the same as me
Jazzy hoe's, I feel ya Jermaine Dupri
Because classy ain't the thing to be and yes it's plain to see
If you a skank you can't hang with me

No, I can't have no rat claimin' me, like a leech, clang to me
Or much, you should be shamed to be
Ridin' in the Chevy thing with me, it's not the place for them
Jazzy, classy girls I'm chasin' them, I wanna stay with them

And lay with them, passin' pussy's not the way for them
I'm lacin' 'em with more ice than a hockey stadium
She gets down with me, freakin' in any position
Fine as all our dough, no, don't need me no pigeon

I'm needin' a pinchin' to make sure that I'm not dreaming
Like Cash Money, when you see her it's like bling, bling
I'm lookin' for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter

I need a jazzy bitch, a classy bitch

I can't' remember these old rhymes
It's hard catchin' these old rhymes

[Kalage]
Shit we comin' after the whack rappers
Studio gat-clappers slash jackers
Them braggin' back-stabbin' non-rappin' autographers
And I'm backed up like brake lights don't beep me
That's some shit you ain't gon' see like a punch in a snake fight
Or a preacher that play dice
It's another level bitch
And I'm sick of rappers braggin' bout they diamond bezelled wrists
My ice this, my ice that
I bet I'll melt yo shit
Cause Shawn J come hotter than the Devil's dick
Couldn't beat me if I was yo dick
We were in the movies
Watchin' porn flicks in 3D
And you were PeeWee
I don't blow shit out of proportion
I'll stuff you in yo mama's stomach
Rap her then make her have an abortion
The Vince Carter of rap, Shawn tall and brown skinned
Dunkin' dick in yo bitch with my arm in the rim
Keep yo hoe I chase dough
Burnin' rappers till sun-up
And jackin' off layin' on my back tryin' to come up
To get grip
Shawn slick with bricks for chips
I flip one-fifth of a brick
Nicks go for 6
Tug a four-fifth with more glits than 6 twists
I don't sniff but I spit
Catch a whiff nit-wit
Slick 6 style switch
Like a whip stick shift
I stole rap like the grinch stole Christmas
My clique pissed tryin' to hit licks to get grip
Tryin' to make more bread than Bisquick Biscuits
This misfit pissed cause I hit his chick
He mad cause I'm Indiana like Rik Smits
But he don't know I'm underground like the Ninja Turtle
He want to fight but he type that couldn't injure Urkel
I play the cut though
Mr. Nice guy slash cut throat
Spit doo-doo like you butt blow
UH-OHHHH y'all best to get runnnin'
Why? Shhh! I hear Field Mob comin'

Can't stop the Mob
Can't stop Boondox
Can't stop Kalage
Repeat 11x's

[Boondox Blax]
Uh, it's you boy Boondox aka Smoke from the Mob
That charcoal color lyrical criminal spittin' flows from yo ?
I break bricks down in yo hood and take over yo block
Whatever you want I got it from the South Coast to the Rocks
Open up shop totin' a glock with a scope on the top
Two clips in each ankle tucked low in my sock
Like lil' whodi Wayne ? I'll have yo block scorchin' hot
You need oven gloves to get yo mail out of yo box
To you rappers thinkin' you gonna come control my block
Check yo face you see a infrared now way it's not
Close to yo eye and in yo ears and all up in yo teeth too
So many red dots look like you sick with the measles
My clique hold heat too
But I roll with more people
Macks like Rudy Ray Moore, Goldie and Seigel
Like Bebe we don't die we multiply like wet gremlins
Jack Martin girl
It's best you hide the baguettes listen
We the best spittin' gold rhymes
Lyrics stickin' to yo brain as if yo pillow was porcupine
Not only yo mind
I poke yo tummy like Doughboy
Makin' ya bummy
Droppin' lyrical bows to yo stomach
Smokey done it in two years and 4 weeks
I ain't lying
If Jigga Jordan
You can call me the Kobe Bryant of this rap shit
So go get more practice
I skipped college and high school ? I ain't even pass it
Barely made it past the 10th grade
You been writin' for 20 years
And still writin' and I been in this shit getting' paid
Spittin' raid at you cockroaches
It makes you move out the way if you did not notice
Here come the Mob

You are not alone 'cause I'm going through this thing with you 
You don't have to cry no more 
If we make it through this pain, promise I'm gon' keep it real with you 
You don't have to cry no more 

(Boondox) I remember bein broke with no record deal 
(Kalage) Broke with no job 
(B) Too broke to smoke dope 
(K) Man, times so hard 
    I want to take my own life 
(B) That's what pain do to you 
(K) But I'm too broke to even die 
(B) I couldn't afford a funeral 
(K) I'm too broke to spend time 
(B) y'all don't know how it feel 
    I could've been a metal welder 
(K) 'Cause I know how to steel (steal) 
(B) Naw, I ain't braggin, I'm just keepin it real 
    I was so broke my wet dream was 'bout eatin a meal 
(K) Man I been homeless 
(B) You ever spent the night in the grass? 
(K) With ants and mesquitos 
(B) While they bitin ya ass 
(K) My best friend got shot nine times for nothin 
    He was all I had, we used to lie and say we was cousins 
(B) Even momma turned her back on me, wouldn't look me in my face 
    I'm a disgrace to my folks... 
(K) 'Cause I ain't graduate? 
(B) I ain't have nobody 
(K) Man, I wish I was dead 
(B) I was alone so I turned to God and he said 

(Chorus) 

(Boondox) 
As far as I remember, I been in high school ever since elementary 
Since the fifth I been twistin spliffs and hittin the weed 
My eyes went through menestration every day in the summer 
At age six, my piss could crank up a Hummer 
Had a hooker mom, like Alfred she Hitchcock 
Bumped dad, 'cause when he visit it was like a pit stop 
I lived knock hard, like Jay-Z, boy ya won 
Things got harder, at age eighteen, I bought a gun 
A three-eighty caliber, for street crazy scavengers 
Tryna take my ???, I'll turn your hat lavender 
Sacks of herb in my pocket I smoke eventually 
Supposed to be sellin 'em, but it's hard to give 'em away 
Livin the day for tomorrow, so on the down-low 
I used beats and rhymes, why not, look at me now 
From flippin dimes, playin get like me to get a dollar 
To ridin on my own twenties in my Impala, I ain't cryin 

(Chorus) 

(Kalage) 
Well, I been hearin a lotta people say that blood's thicker than water 
Well answer this then, which would you swallow? 
I said that to say, it don't matter, friend or kin 
Shawn ain't my cousin but he here through thick and thin 
(B) OK, I came up but all the faith folks came down 
(K) The script flip flopped 
(B) Now the game changed round 
    Everybody want to chill now, in my grill now 
    Now my smile ice cold, white gold like whooooooaaaa!

Quick rain the flip flop, gang stank in the zip locks

While you blazin' the gun an' too dirty, ain't no wastin' his bong
Representin' the place where you from, the gritty, biddin' player
Suburbans on twenties player, swing at a grinnin' player

Smoltin' reds, foul heads, phase fours an' glats
The watermelon, beer can an' peaches, we roll with that
Want a visit? Well, the welcomers deader than door mat
Wanna beef? Well, run your way, do it in 'bout four flat

Thought you was a queen, hell yea I broke bread
For slow sex and more head than asprin 
Lately huff'n and puff'n, bus'n nuts gaspin 
For air, grabbin your hair, you booted over
Never reachin the bed legs spread on the sofa
Gave you my time and money that's all I had 
I ain't ask you for shit but you gave me crap
Yea I heard you was fuck'n and suck'n my boy Dennis
(sean let me explain) wait a minute let me finish
While I be at the job work'n bus'n my ass
You be sneak'n and creep'n the street fuck'n for cash
I can't believe this shit girl I loveded you 
Now I wish I wouldn't even fucked wit you 
You can use the phone you better call Tyrone
Pack your shit and be gone when I come back home

You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me 
But then you changed on me 
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

Field Mob,"Rent thirty days late, gotta be gone by Saturday
Tired of sellin' cocaine, folks tryna trap me
Every night dreamin 'bout livin' life lavish
A watch full of karats, a candy coated Caddy

Off the show flo', sittin' on fo' Vogues
Oak wood gear shift, steer and dash door
Choppin' on seventeen inch Indies
Bling bling from my mouth to my pinky

Enough about my jewelry, grill and my Fleetwood
Financially stable so my folks can eat good
House sittin' out on the hill to sleep good
Livin' peaceful just like we should

Money legal, no more sellin' reefer
No more feds tryna stick me like a needle
When it's cold outdo's come in I heat ya
You ain't gotta walk in the sun, I A.C. ya

Don't worry 'bout that burglar comin' to creep ya
He trapped by alarms and the millimeter

Most cut yolk and smoke 'ports, cut throats and ya dope hoe
Talk about they wanna 'Lac with four do's, no Vogues

Wood kit and Momo's, outfits- Polo, pockets- so swole
Jenny Craig called- Escalade hog in the yard
Breakin' off ya folks too, belly full of soul food
Chitt'lins, greens, pork chops, green beens

Yeah, I pray for that, each and every day I rap
I rap with God 'cause I feel you ain't really safe with gats
We escape slacks but government helped in welfare
My folk cries to the law and ain't no help there

We ain't had much, the less to brag about but mo' to lose
I ran the street, Mama told me go to school
But now I got a chance to change thangs and maintain
Mo' so, I ain't gotta slang 'caine no mo'

Don't disguise the dirt then 'cause we all know rocks
It's the real reason furniture go to the pawn shop
'Cause ya crackhead 'cause smokin' the car antennas
I understand see, it's a junkie in every family

'Member hand-me-down, tight pants, lookin' slim in 'em
If they too big, what you do? Put a hem in 'em
'Member talkin' over the loud sounds when the wind blow
'Cause the trash bag's replacin' yo' car window
Man, I been po', I been poor, we been po'
That's how it is in the Field, for real

Brown-skinned cinnamon, playin' and pimpin' men
Swimmin' in Benjamins
Body like a Buick bumpin', jumpin' and jigglin'
Butt look like big lips talkin' and whisperin'

Either her booty talkin' or my Hennessey kickin' in
I smile, give a grin, grab that butt with both hands
Man she moved it over and started hunchin' my Jimmy then

See, I'm gon' hit her then switch up and stick her friend
I'm skinny built like a spoon, they grits I'm diggin' in
I don't be spendin' ends but they gon' givin' chin
They lick it and kiss it then say

They pagin' and beepin', beggin' for me to come hit again
I'm pimpin' plenty women, game stronger than twenty men
Damn lil' momma proper halter top and knee-knockers
But before I freak the senorita she gotta

Dark skinned chocolate, plus shawty drop a 'llac
Big breasts are proper set, her game, she on top of it

Vicky Secret scents in the air, why I want her pop her leg
I heard in the streets that shawty give lots of head
Good hot my mouth too, have you jumpin' up out the bed

And plus shawty rock baguettes, chickens wanna chop her head
Off 'cause she jazzy with more cheese than broccoli
We on the dance floor, from side to side she rockin' it
Toot it up and stoppin' it then droppin' and poppin' it

She said ""Ooh, you on hard"" I had to stop and check
Pants pokin', I knew then her number I gotta get
Tipsy off of Heineken ready to shake some
Shawty flexa, time to have sexa

I like the ones with the weave
The thong-th-th-thong-th-thongs and Capri's
You can come home with me if you a girl on them six-inch heels
Or a black blonde with the natural and gold in yo grill

Earring in yo tongue, you dark and you lovely
Fine from yo heels up,but yo toes ugly
Plus it ain't bubbley, the back part
I ain't actin' hard, but you ain't touchin' me

Look, them tight Capri pants be fittin' her right
But her booty is much bigger, so that's what I like
I know a lot of shawty's out there sayin' that's not right
But she the jazziest and that's what I'ma take home tonight

A me say, I know a little girl by the name of Suzy
She look so sweet and she really sexy
I go home and she take off my shoe
Say ""Ohh Paparuby, let me make love to you""

On top my mind, me say ""My, my, my""
The woman on top of the woman is a lesbian
But the Ruby on top of woman it's a stylin' fashion
Stylin' fashion, it's a stylin' fashion

But it keep calling me. Show me the ben ja mes

[Verse One: Kalage]
My shorty done cut me loose, and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in the pants
He's 60, she's in her 20's, she said I be hard in her, overworking her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm birthing her
She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I bought my ex home for her
But now she dropped me, like the pen at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it she be like no, like Laura Winslow to Urkel
And What if I did misuse and abuse your clique, I'll apoligize
'Cause I ain't know ruler sticks would bruise the clique
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now, she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle
She said, when I got head, I dug in her cheek now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
If she feeling like I'm feeling then she won't go
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
She say she don't want no more

[Verse Two: Boondox Blak]
I woke up this morning stretching,yawning with a hard on ??? ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got to bring her to bed to hit her some more, but I found this envelope
Sitting on the pillow, I opened it, unfolded it, it said Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me Little Debbie Cake, and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take
The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me
Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(and peeing across my breast and thighs)
Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
humpday Wednesday, then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday, and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip when I ask you to eat me twice, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you dox
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere

[Chorus] - repeat 2X",Cut Loose
Field Mob,"Yeah, all in my face feelin' me
All in my face feelin' me

We was up in the club
Fillin' these with all the intention we sip of Hennessey
My friend and me, I caught my niggas killin' me
Testin' weed until the enemy got the Tennessee

To hinder me, all in my face feelin' me
Bud we pretend to weed, Hennessey to silly games
Gangstas throwin' them signs up and up and down
Bumpin' enemies sayin' things that offendin' me

Still here and we ballin' half drunk, passin' out song after song
Inhalin' gun after gun, passin' out blunt after blunt, havin' fun
Them niggas took a jab at me, then one push from the back of me
Tryin' to tackle me and wrestle me

Couldn't get me down, so they hit me in the back and beat
They had me badly beaten
I gotta gash in me, but it was just a scratch to me
At first did get some Vaseline

A half a week, it cleared up fast and clean
To a scratch you were bad to see, so I ain't mad to see
I want to squash and flatten and beat
Like White Castle's and crystal square beef patties beat

'Cause I'm so sick of you harassin' me and playin' with me
So can we canopy?
Before we 'cause a tragedy and someone pain and agony
But if you feel you can handle me and still wanna take the man in me
This time I'll have to shut you down, like Sunshine Hennesin', because

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

Ow, ow, ouch, it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad

I'm from the home of racist rednecks and confederate flags
You could strand them hussies, politicians and drags
Cotton pickin', slave tradin' and nigga lynchin'
Lead to more oppression, me cricket caught trigger pinchin'

Ridin' along, mindin' my own business, God as my witness
It was five in the morn', passin' along, hop in the corner
No, police, hold up, turn the radio down
Put your seatbelt on, shit, God damn
Give me the fuckin' weed, he's gone

John, what? He kept goin'

It's like I got enemy's, 'cause of my race they hate me
Fuck pullin' over, chase me
Guess it's safe to say it makes me crazy
Can't give up, 'cause this hate it makes me

Wanna grab an AK spray strays on 8th street
8 ways and blaze the day bleed
E E 8 D D E 8 be
Tryin' to say we pull more keys than a leash of ladies

Well, okay, hate me, say we crazy but lately, baby
Even criticizin' the way we say things
I pray everyday, but the way he hating
I wish Jeff Dahmer was here, why?

So he could eat President Bush's baked beans
That's why I've been a crook since 18
Leave me alone, listen to what the hook is saying

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

What's up son, it's Allecious, it's your boy, smoke
AKA Chevy Pentagram to cut your 'cain, again
And uh, I got a problem with you bitches
I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired

I can't even leave the muthafuckin' club
With a clean pair of muthafuckin' Schnegals
'Cause the muthafucka wanna step of my feets

I gotta check my muthafuckin'
Polo for birth spots and liquor stains
'Cause a muthafucker want oppression
But wanna get me on purpose

I'm sick of this shit
Don't be mad at me 'cause my earrings so big
And brighter than your beetch, nigga

And you beetch, don't be mad at me
'Cause my tires bigger than your niggas tires
On his Chevy, shit

With the big ole owl, dual heads roaring
Or is it the caprice sittin' Emmitt smiths...that's 22's

On the impala on 20 inches
Mo' wood in it than old abe lincoln's cabin
And with mo' glass in it, than in your cabinets
Or is it the way we come down watchin' xxx

White sex from the ceilin', visors, and headrests
Or is it the ?? chain, the Gucci hat, the gucci air Jordan retros to match
Even though I step on the scene, so fresh and so clean
Nice takin' with me, I still got my weapon wit' me

Strapped wit' a tech in my jeans
Ready to squeeze, cause I know you haters get tempted to wear my
Neck-a-lace.

No hustlers, thugstas, mobstas, and field niggas

And once again I'm gunnin, copped the big 500

Niggas hide out or they ride out cause my shit runnin
I sold more oz's than cd's and lp's

If you fuck niggas keep tellin'.

And ceelo twankys (choppin)

Man, I want to shoot, slap, punch, kick, cut that niggaa!
That's what they say on the low
We're losing himmmm!
That's what paramedics'll say

While you lay on the floor
Can we all just get along? smoke trees, hit a bong
Haters pussy niggas, so I'm a choke 'em wit' a thong
Even the block envy me, I make a mill wit' the flo'

But I'm better wit' coke and hot hennessey
My peers is like queers they only get mad
'Cause I ride rims old enough to buy beers
They smileeee while hatin' but when it comes to fakes
I spot more than dalmations

Nobody deserve to be, hustled
Look here, run I dare ya

If its pride or die, I'm choosing respect
I saw my daddy hung dead, wit a noose on his neck
My niece got raped pregnant, won't tell she scared
Master done it, but she blaming it on drop dead Fred
But one day, things gon' change for better
Lord knows it can't rain forever

Two days later master sold my momma (master sold my momma)

uh, uh, uh. I'm in the field, that's white lil' niggas and me
From dusk to dawn til the sun come and it leave
Through all seasons, Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring
Picking, pushing, pulling, cutting the field
Sweating bout to dehydrate, stuck in the heat
and when its cold, joints lock up barker than trees
Rest, I don't get enough of my sleep
cause master got us working late night, and then waking up in the wee
Hours of the morning, stacking stalks of hay
Hoping the rain from dawn til shower day
Wishing I could walk away
But then I think about Hardaway
Master cut off his hand
cause you can't talk or sing or speak from your mouth
If it ain't what master talk or say
But I was taught to pray to the Lord and have faith
Please take me away from this awful place
cause you can be so off today

[Slimm Calhoun]
Man I tell ya drop shit, ain't nothing
nuff suffering, done dealt with more headaches the buffering
Gotta spend my time off the destructive by getting by doe bubbling
can't risk stumbling, fumbling
So I'm bout taking my life, dice tumbling
I drop down the road, trying to get that pot of gold
Still out in the field, mobbing with Sean and Smoke
9 times, nine to five, I'm troop serving
Nine, you bout trying to eat well, get in line
'cause momma got laid off, the lil' sis need shoes
My brother just got popped back in his county blues
and Pops been made it off, there was no money, no food
Coming through next week, my rent and my girl due
Life ain't got no rules, destruction, one-two's
So every now and then, your gonna sing the blues

What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong

Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected

I'm so sick of bein' lon'
Ah, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
'cause ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
'Cause I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
Something so pretty as you at home alone
That's unbelievable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
Now, I never put nothin' before you
That's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon

Little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I want to know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad 
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I want to know how it feels to be loved, be loved
Sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I want to know how it feels to be loved, be loved

Ah..ah two times
Comin up, and I feel you and I done it up together
Crushed a qt time
And tha fun is up
Sun down, and the sun is up
Late at night night and day, you was up under me
Or I was up under ya
Punda ya
When I'm on the cut I can come to ya
And when I bust, you suck it up like a pundaba
You kept a bundle a under ya
Gucci or a Coach bag
Whatever ya got ya gave Smoke had
that's why its so sad...when ya say (ta take meee)
And I gotta disappoint cha
Its not I don't want cha
Its that I got thangs to do peeps to see
Expensive champagnes to drank trees to tree
And drop mo hits than Tina T receive from Ike
And mo classics than rees
And Chevy caprice
So please be sweet
And believe in me
And understand ya can't be with me
But ya ain't trying ta hear it 'cause ya still screaming to me

But anyway....One night in the club I waayy in the back
You know...V.I.P. C.I.B.
Low-key
Like the midget locksmith...chillin
Listen..long story short bumped into my ex
Talked, walked her to the bar and back to the rooomm
We played doctor I played the part of the papsmith...
diggin all up in her womb
Next morning she said (Where are you going?)
Uh um wa..well I..I had was gone kick it with Craig a..and 'nem
Gotta Go!! See Ya When I See Ya!!
Hook-Until End",Where R U Going?
Field Mob,"Stay up Hold ya head up
It's hell in the streets boy
Hold your head young nigga
'Cause it's hell

I'm sittin' in the courtroom, stomach full of butterflies
Somebody help me, cause my life is in the Judge eyes
They got me for a Humbug, and that's some bullshit
I should've listened to them preachers in the pulpit

Stressin' to heaven, seemed like I was born by mistake
While the races dominate, got me victim to the Legislate'
I'm playin' for kicks, hustle and rob reefer, it medicated my mind,
Fuck the World, with crime

My mamma died in '92 so crazy, what the fuck to do?
Daddy smokin' hard, not knowin' that it corrupted two chillin'
I'm starin' at the ceilin', can't take too many blows
The pain be killin', got the sinus up in my nose, oh

These people want to hurt me, my momma dead, so fuck 'em
A small timer on the rise, so nothin' I feel
To my niggas in the county, I might do a bit with ya
Boy, in the streets I don't care with ya, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

Now I was born broke, but I'll be damned if I'm a die that way
Love my momma, can't deny that face and as a child
Everynight I prayed for a rap record deal, man sometimes
Twice I'd say, ""Lord save me, take me away from here""

Twenty now, and I've been sellin' yay' for years
But why we had a house, and couldn't keep it?
Why we evicted? Why we get more pink slips than Victorias Secret?
Why I gotta rob? Why my pappa ain't gotta job? Why I ain't graduate?

Why through high school I ain't have a date?
Why I had to masturbate? Why I'm wearing hand me downs?
Why I'm in and out of jail? Why I let my family down?
Why my uncle died? Wish it would've been me

He ain't rob, he ain't hustle, should've been me
Preacher man, could you pray for me, faithfully?
When God comes lay him his herbs, tell him wait for me

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

He just keep layin' his hands on my momma again
Family ties, this is where the drama begins
Tellin' my momma on the floor, bitch this and bitch that
Locked in my prayin' to God, ""Please let me get back""

He's trippin' like he's outta control
So he had to of been smokin'I heard her croke
Through the wall, she was gaggin' and chokin'
Eleven years old, and I don't need to be seein' this shit

But in my tape deck, eight ball talkin' about beatin' a bitch
It got me confused, but damn, you shouldn't popp her that hard
And when them folks come , her stupid ass be droppin' the charge
Whippin' her ass like a man, right and left with his fists

Heavely blows to the dome, now she slicing her wrists
I'm hyped and I'm pissed, soaking wet with blood holdin' her limb
It's gonna be all right, she whispered with her bleedin' lip
She passed out, eyes rolled back, I'm tryin' not to panic

Step daddy walked in, saw my momma, then he went in a frantic
Blood leakin', non stop, permanent rush with the fever
She almost died, of loss of blood, I knew my momma wouldn't leave me
She don't deserve to live in pain, she just wanted to be happy

Feelin' like a puss, I didn't help her 'cause he ain't even my daddy
She's back at home, and he puttin' his hands on her again
Livin' in eternal fire, where drama doesn't end

It's hell
Nobody knows, the load, my soul tow
Nobody knows, the load, my soul tow

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

Field Mob,"



[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Its ya boy Chevy P babe...
Listen

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I remember as a kid back.. in the days
I got picked on kicked at... shit on spit at
Get gone get back (gone Smoke) get away
Havin a dark pigmentation was hard then to make friends
Felt like God didn't take his time with me
He musta made me late night tired and sleepy
Cause life wasn't easy they dogged me
Said that I was so dark the bet I could sweat coffee
And peepee sweet tea and spit oil
Say when ashy I lotion down in Armor All
Made me feel like a loser really lame
Because of my complexion nobody would include me in games
Not even tag never ""it"" nobody would touch me
Nope no girlfriends cause shawties thought I was ugly
Through all the jokes and laughs pokes and stabs blows and jabs
Hopin sad mopin mad before the scabs nobody told me that...

[Hook w/ 2Pac sample from ""Keep Ya Head Up""]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
(this song is to all the dark skinned)
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry t-the blacker the berry
The blacker the blacker the blacker the blacker

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I ain't have Marvin Gaye to sing to me
And make me feel like black was the thing to be
Until Big Daddy Kane I was so glad he came
Made me feel good about bein black again cause
We was at the bottom of the market
(Al B.) made (Sure) it was a problem to be dark skinned
Until (Wesley Sniped) him
In with the darkies out with the light skinned
Now we got Tyrese Taye and Tyson
Mekhi Phife in every movie ya likin
Blade he remind me of a modern day Panther
While Batman (hides behind a mask) like a (Klansman)
We have to achieve... ('Caine's killin us)
Like it killed the second son of Adam and Eve
Ya palm is white and spread fist still black and tightly now
Slappin five was cool but rather ya ball ya fist and give me pound
'cause

[Hook]

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Tiger Woods say he ain't black... whatever
They say Michael Jackson ain't white... whatever
And Venus and Serena done beat mo white girls
Than O.J. and Rick James put together
Now Michael Vick's the new black hero
Bet John Madden ain't see it comin
(saw a quarterback as a negro)
Jordan he can't hide it he look like an African Tribal leader
If you can lighten him then you can brighten me up
Now don't get me wrong and think I'm prejudiced
Listenin to this song.. I'm not racist
As a matter of fact shout out to Jamie Lori and Chad
My white friends from Lee County to Bladecliff
Just bein dark is it what's like bein white in the audience
At a black comedy show I
Was guaranteed to get cracked on and joked out
Now this ugly duckling is a swan I know now

[Hook]

It's the F-be-I

We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia

Wit the missin tooth
Who wouldn't do shit to you
We just sit in two
The back of the class
Write raps in his pad
His pencil to to his tablet
Listenin to little music instrumental tracks
And they laughed, wit shit to lose
He practiced and practiced
Wit no clue dat it would happens this fast
Made his presence, he quickly grew
Rapidly fast, sold packs for the cash
H03$ passing they ass
Like they then see me, now I'm rich they do
Went from moving more 50's than shady and dre
To coming up like masturbation on planes
Gotta save for the rain

Be five minutes before ya see me 'cause I'm drivin' slow

They shinin' brighter than the sun I wash 'em from Monday to Sunday
I wax on and wax off like I'm Daniel-san
My roof's missin' on my car, it's topless like a titty bar
I thought I saw my ceiling on the back of a milk carton

Twenty-four inch wires spin Pirellis on my tire's wheel
Enough fuel in my Chevy to start a campfire wit'
The doors open by remote that's why you see no handles
Watch the doors go up like a Lambo

[Verse 1 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Nowadays girls and boys wanna lick me
Her put her tongue on me him pull his gun onme
I won't let 'em get me I stay strapped
In case I try to stick her and he try to stick me
So I'm... packin my magnums
In case I gotta blast one
The only time I'm leakin out my head is when I'm sweatin
You ain't gon have me layin dead in my Chevy
I worked hard for my rings shades and bracelet
He left dead came to take it brains eraded
He bled red stains in pavement
His crane split slain he lay stiff.. think about it...
Before you make that move this be ya warning
He's ready to be squeezed like an orange
Bullets penetrate ya (bleedin like menustration)
I'ma empty out (more shells) than in (Run-D.M.C.'s) closet

[Hook - Chevy P aka Smoke]
I got my..
Pistol grip on the side of me
And ain't no bitch gon catch me slippin cause it ride wit me
I got my heater in my lap I'm squeezin on my strap
Try me you'll bleed
I let it rip empty the clip
Run up you'll die in these streets

[Verse 2 - Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay known to rip a instrumental
You can bleed like I wrote pen but this one in a pencil
Starvin artist I paint a picture
Way I (touch O's) everyday for me like a game of (Twister)
Achievement say I'm a legend
Ghetto bitches be wishin they could spend a day in my presence
I'm stackin plenty dough I stay on cloud nine
Like 2Pac in ""I Ain't Mad At Cha"" video
Now start with me I'ma target ya click
The (Scope) I got ain't the type you (gargle and spit)
It sit on top of the fifth small semi's and 4-4s
Heat'll leave a enemy so cold
Thirty feet away with one eye squinted
You look like the man on the fuckin Public Enemy logo
First nigga start shit
Watch the tech spray a flame like a airbrush artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Shiit.. I'll die for mine you ain't gon take it wit ease
You better go (jack monterey) for his (cheese)
You run up on me in my 745 Beamer
You catch 7 shots from my 45... eat em
In my lap is where the heat's kept
I ride strapped and I ain't talkin about no seatbelts
When I pull shoot and blast I'm aimin at cha head
To make sure you dead you better wear a bullsetproof mask

[Shawn Jay]
It's no secret I keep the nina
It sit soul/sole food like sneaker cleaner
I sell those pies I tell no lies
Cookies same size as Tickle-Me-Elmo's eyes
You don't know no dirt
I'll put a hole through the head of the horse in ya polo shirt
Like a nerd in a science fair hang around projects
Bluck! when I stop by

Why is it when my frown is down side up ya smile is upside down?
Is it because of my fly style or is it my nice house?
Is it 'cause I'm iced out and livin' a life now that
I'm 'bout through strugglin' everything is alright now?

You see the jag on them flats pass
Don't get mad, get glad like the trashbags
You just pray and pray on my downfall
When I'm up ya down me when I'm down ya clown me

Claimin' to be my friend but really softer than the spot
In my back to ease his knife in
He ain't got love for me, I wrote a rhyme about it
That hole ya dug for me you tryna climb up out it

Ya bust ya head at the bottom now ya cryin' about it
Well, when around came right back around and got him
The more paper the more haters, I need more cheese
Cause the haters I got they startin' to bore me

You be smilin' when I'm frownin'
You be frownin' when I'm smilin'
You be happy when I'm sad

You be happy when I'm sad
But when I'm glad you get mad, yeah

From the tip o' ya nose to the tip o' ya toes
Y'all ain't nothin' but some hatin'
Smilin' in my face everyday like ""What up Luda""
I'm just waitin' for the day to put a slug up to ya

Ol' fake kissers walk past diss ya
Breathe you a wannabe me, why?
Cause I got new whips and wreck 'em or
Cause I got flows that make, bend it like Beckham

Is it 'cause a lot of money stay close to me?
Or is it cause you should have been where I'm supposed to be?
Well, everyday I stay fresh whole fam got cheese
So I could care less what you think about me

I thank my enemies and I truly adore 'em
Best way to get back at somebody is to ignore 'em
I'm the heavyweight champ, we'll see who gon' drop
Cause everybody in the bottom know who on top, Luda

Last exit for the lost (straight from album cover)

Would you pay life's pleasures to see me?
Does it hurt, for I want you to remain?
I run your hair through, in another decade
Summer land holds me, in Sumerian haze

Pain in places, where the lovers mourn
Arranging the play things, up and down the hall
Forever remain, for every day
My honour remains, forever remain

Between the spaces along the wall
Appearing faces that disappear at dawn
We're getting closer, I can see the door
Closer and closer, kthulhu calls

Forever remain, forever remain
You'll seek it, it'll take a while
You'll seek this, if it's a thousand miles
Take what fate brings, eternal and desire
I'll change those faces, then I take their smile

We're getting close to you, I can see the door
Closer and closer, or is it there at all

Forever remain, forever remain
This could be my last regress, last exit for the lost 
This could be my last regress, last exit for the lost 
This could be my last regress, precious for the lost",Celebrate

Come to my hood, it's just as fucked,
Million dollar homes on every single block,

For beating on the kids, it's fucking sad,
Women trying to plot to kill their husband,
It's just fifty grand, fifty grand
Your pop's is dead, and your mom says,
Here's my new man ,his name is Sam,

Got to handle my business, get on my shit list,
Mommies never home, believe me I lived this,
I'm all alone, no love comes with riches,
Fuck a big home, no one should live this)

I came back home, from running away,
There's Sam, with some bitch named Fay,
Where's my mom at, your mom got caught for killing your pops,
By the way kid, this is your aunt Fay,
And you wonder why I'm in trouble everyday,
Beaten on little kids, punking class,
Selling drugs, getting paid (getting paid)
So I dropped out of school, and met this 5 kids,
On my block, they were really cool (really cool),
Just as fucked up as me, and corrupt you see,
Everyone eat a dick, this is our gangsta click,
Just need a little love, not your money spent

Rebelling and stealing, and selling and dealing,
Were like your worst fuckin villains, trying to hide out feelings,

Destructive little punk, breaking everything I see,
Creep in your house, and I'll piss on your couch,
Tag all your walls, tear the heads of your daughter's dolls,

Shave your cat's back is a must,
Then I'll wipe my ass with your favorite tooth brush,
Erase all the numbers on your cellie phone,
On my way out, toilet paper your home,

Shit in a bag, light it on fire,
You open the door there's a bad on fire,
Stomp out the flames, dookie on your feet,

So I'm out for the night, being a neighborhood jerk,
Back out on the street, backpack full of treats,
Someone's gonna get burnt , stuff a frog full of fire crackers,
Put em on your door step,

You open the door it smells like chicken breast,
Drive by shooting, that's not for me,
But I'll drive by, and egg your car,
Now that's just funny, haha,

Pouring salt on snails, shooting birds out of trees,

So don't tag along, rebel from the hell

Fieldy's Dreams,"Burn down to the ground everything I own 
Everything you need is temporary 
And everything you want is so petty 
Materialistic shit makes me sick 
You're through with your cars (nyaah), your house, your money (nyaah) 
It's just for now doesn't sound funny (nyaah...nyaah)
Your wife, your kids your family, your life (nyaah)
It's just for now it's just not right
Open your eyes and you'll see the light 
Stop living in a fairytale life 
There's more to life than just living 
Find it in yourself and start giving 
It'll come back to ya (nyaah) no one's out to sue ya (nyaah)
I lost everything I had I'm not even mad (nyaah...nyaah)
Losing everyone I love will make me sad (nyaah)
If you dwell on the past you simply gonna last

You will not take my mind
You will not take what's mine 
You think you can hurt me by stealing from me (oh why) (Fieldy: nyaah)
You think I owe it to you (Fieldy: nyaah)
This is everything I do (Fieldy: nyaah...nyaah)
You can't rape me take from me (Fieldy: nyaah)
But you ain't got me

This pain and misfortune is pure fucking hell
Take it away nothing will change
I will still feel the same this is too much pain 
Am I being tortured time will only tell 
Am I insane (nyaah) or am I in hell 
Gotta have faith (nyaah) not someone to scorch it (nyaah...nyaah)
Live your own life no reason to rebel (nyaah)
All of this hatred this has to be hell 
Feeling down on yourself try living my life
More money more problems that ain't no lie 
If you take it all away I rather scream bye 
Day by day one day at a time 
Doesn't make me gay (nyaah) It takes a man to cry (nyaah)
Your not alone wipe that tear from your eye (nyaah...nyaah)
Life is a gift you should put it on a throne 
Not materialistic (nyaah) shit appreciate your life

[Jonathan Davis - Chorus]

[Fieldy]
I can't wait to die (die) if it's up to me 
I wouldn't be alive (alive) not suicidal
But I've had a rough life drugs will make 
You dumb but they won't kill your pain
Look at the bright side I'm trying to stay (nyaah)
Sane I would never take my life over (nyaah) 
Depression and pain that's just part of life (nyaah...nyaah) 
Life, life it's just a test treat it with respect (nyaah)
You're here for a reason not to be depressed

To be a provider

Funny how you got a 1000 grams
How the dope heads just wanta be me

A young g
With a half a nerve
About to act a fucking donkey just for half a bird
That's my word
Smoking backwoods filled with erb
Hanging later than street lights posted up on the curb
The ultimate serve
Getting it off all in a week
Time to re up
So I'm go be up
Getting the grind in the streets
Nigga!

(Chorus 2X)
I keep my strap on me at all times(and I ain't lying)(I ain't lying)
I keep my strap on me at all times(and I ain't dying)(I ain't dying)

Nigga who lied and told ya these streets was safe
We about to burn the chase
In all the place 
Go be leavin discrace
Watch what happen to who dare to step in my face
Strong arming for space
Which shop
I'm go leave them baggin grams
I'm a bad man
Strap in my hand
Give me some mad plans
Picture my city
Surrounded by crimnals
And then some
I'm go have to hit one
And back them bitches off with my m-one
Them domes!!!! domes!!!!!!
That's what he caught
Have to lay him in chalk
Should seen Serv
Insurance should of been bought
What the FUCK you thought
That Fiend 
State ya rank
The silent private
That be pistol whippin niggas down to the ground
Till there bodies turn blue and violet
My greed is violent!!
Born with plans to be ?
When the folks come I'm go leave it
Got him in the headlock
Some niggas ?
911 go need it
My nine my only justice
Rollin past screamin fuckers
My nine stang a nigga quick like some nunchucks

Brang ya boys and ya another gat
You'll be suckin up stains
Beware of my nigga

About to act bad, and I ain't been home for a week
I want to see ends, I also want to see ends meet
The last high that I had was the jailhouse heat
Gotta go 223, that's the waiting in the shade
a lot of people about to end up dead, runnin around with their lead
Being followed by the nigga hating feds
I had to ask them, what's that in your hand, all I said
Picture Fiend with this, they made me do it my friend
And I make em see it end, 'fore you bout to take me in
See shit spin, I'm tryin to get the crack in the day
Word on the streets, you really got it happenin your way
Now I'm rapping away, but not to keep me out the penn
But since I'm out, I'm out to test the hearts of men
See this wimpy grin, it mean, one seven he die
With cabbage aside, you bitches still gonna be the baddest alive

Still the baddest motherfucker alive

Say what, say what? x4

My name is Fiend, damn right I'm a attack his trailer
see told me look a man in the eyes 'fore you kill him
ain't too many niggas really got on the billing
To better pockets, ready for some violent killing
Now ready puff in the cutlass, at the down south buck it
Taking other peoples shit, loving every minute of it
You know what it takes to go against odds
Watching my back, with some niggas like Keke and Boz
Jump in my 81 ride, lookin for prey in the meal
Gimme everything, I'll see if this tank is for real
I dish this raw deals to keep this ghetto peal
I think I truly love ?????????
For somebody getting through me 
My hunger make sure ain't no human being at the war place speak
Alone at street stories and ties 
And remember, no sleepy eyes, I'm the baddest alive

Whoa there, big timer, big timer

Let the champagne glasses, cashes, comin out the ass
Drinks for everybody, biggest mama stickin up the tab (mama mia)
Don't even ask if I could handle it
Bitch you didn't know I'm stackin ends like the clampets (there it is)
Down south hustlin, workin my musc-lin
Mint greens labeled in God we trust'n
Bustin at the haters in the way of progress
Cause I ain't tryin to live from month to month (naw) that's stress
I only want the best that there is off the top
But I ain't bout to brag about the shit I don't got
So when you see the e4-20 know that it's mine, paid out in full
So I put it in my rhyme
Thirty two hundred square foot, no doubt
Manicured landscape, and this my house
Paid out too, so I know I got the room
To state the fact that them hoes don't like that
But fuck that big timers put your knot in the air
And cock your nine for them jackers out there
Live your life, boy

Chorus x 2

[fiend]
I be crackin like chiropractors
Fiend the young bachelor
That's too many muthafuckin million dollars, what I'm after
Meal ticket stash-a from brick flippin plaster
Now forever paid with mama mia and the master
I cause disasters from the s's to the g
No clubs won't start without the presence of me
Ya better ask somebody, my cake give knee chills
Givin migraine headaches from breakin these bills
See these chills but can't get to it, we way out
Every (? ) that I drive on chrome, is paid out
Close to the house on the hill, but no wife
Take the diamonds out my rol, your house have no light
The more ice, I'm wicked you're sick, and just piss ya
Might take a long line, the dance floor on whispers

All I follow is the Jones as I reminisce
Reminisce take chance as I remember this
I was fifteen, anti fiend
Never thought I'd make it to music as a dream
All I had was Kevin and my momma Jackie
The pen and pad, and I have a papi
Taught up from the world, that you gots to be hard
Shit, New Orleans is the city, I remember fightin over wars
See, long before you give me the charge I beat my cause
I'm a nigga no more or less surrounded by flaws
I'm all yours but understand my future thoughts a few
My days could be navy blue, and I'm a believe in you
See I'm TRU, because my niggas keep me goin as well
Droppin tears cause I'm the only one alive to tell
And if I'm goin to hell, at least my life is enriched
By keepin family beside me, and they accepted me as click

Chorus
And I'm a soldier in the world live me long
Cause I a got my hustle on and I done done wrong
No one understands me, neither do my family
That's why I believe in you, to see my ass through, my god x2

I entertains my brain with a cloud of smoke
My brother been gone for five years, and this is how I cope
I hope, wishing and praying that myself be next
My girl die straight innocent but because of a ex
Got me vex drinkin, totin my gun under the moon
And no matter how many bullets, bring her back no time soon
I'm tired of departing with killing, all of my dogs bleedin
Bodies every other day, on Washington and ?????
Oh lord, I'm even scary to open obituaries
Gettin mail from cemeteries stating that I'm buried
Pain varies, to tell the truth it all hurts the same
If I don't to see some rain, cause life is a strange pain
Bullets don't carry names, but me, it's like short
Now here on life support, from not the right support
I hold your quote like the killer, but lose a G
A small fee for what that nigga did to a family

Chorus x2

Shit, I'm a reminisce like this while I'm in a good state of mind
Now I'll never low, truly knows in no greater time
Down line, I've a lost some of my best partners
Bullets pop us got em cause the rhyme, was it the coppers
Now who is to blame, the hunted or the hunter
Cope on his mind, much as I can and wonder
Was my prayers to god injected or neglected
Question the man if I can or respect it
Serious, if just by my minutes, if us gone as beginners
Split em, we piss on the ground, screamin bury me with em
My lord, you never suffer newborn, I'll guard your daughter
Killing in my city like there's something in the water
Why bother?  Because Fiend's strandin heads then I'm gone
And a soldier gonna survive till it's time to go home
Now notice I'm a survivor
My feelings go out to the families of G Slim, and Miss Michelle Tyler

Jungle with them slangers, with them bangers and them hustlers
With them killers, smokin woo and makin deals with my tru niggas
Fiend had some yay, so we flipped it on the block
Steady mobbin' flew from cali so we put 'em up on the spot
Servin dub sacks and flippers, fifty shots and quarter bags
Raisin riches no matter week, servin keys out paper bags
And hustlin hard, countin money by the sack
Watch my back, niggas jack
Sweet revenge, counter attack up in my 'lac
Sippin hennesy and chronic, I'm the tweak for some magic

You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

Nigga gangbang seen tru up on my chest

And that's a shame cause it's bound to change once a niggas rich

I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies

I tell my mom don't trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen a lot of cold shit, ? ? ? ? ? been home test if I get ya

Cocked every rock that I had, Cooked all the dope I could cook
Took a glance at my family, like it was the final look

Have mercy on my soul
And these shops about to be closed
Cause Fiend about to roll

Feel the wrath and my rage
It's bieng displayed
At the effect of poverty's case
This ain't no phase, I'm trapped with that want to live
To protect mine, I miss you with rounds of hot shit
My glock eat it, the only talkin' that you get in verbal
And the way of my pain, so for God we gonna hurt you
It ain't personal, with the thought of playin with my math
Can get that ass in an unending bloodbath(bloodbath)

Fuck open chested, me and my workers bullet proof vested
Suggested cause my least worry is bieng arrested
Upset with cause more these niggas done probably confessed it
See I'm blessed with the game, Came along with my name
Tested for fame, Pushin' out crack cocaine
But watch the pain and strange thangs happen for greenary
And involves seein' me, nigga windex ya scenary
Believe in me is one thing, seein' is another
If I'd have known what i know now, I wouldn't have lost my brother
Streets got death to offer to you fast or slow
But some stash you're doe, you could see the casket front row

So when the courts ask for a plea
My answer is they fucked up and made a nigga like me

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,

Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

I walk, high talk, Gs up and soldiers down
I used to bob and weave when I was on that doodoo brown
Face down on the ground, when Slim come around
Or I be forced to bring more noise than the Beats By The Pound
I just got out the pen, so I bounce when I walk
And say ya heard me, every time that I talk
4-4 boys I used to balk, but now I got a glock 40
I feel sorry for any nigga that wanna get naughty
I love fuckin up parties, watchin bitches like Charlie
Ask Magnolia Shorty, that's my people, she could call it
My mama told me I still walk the same way
Talk the same way, every since I was yay

Chorus 4x

[Fiend]
I ain't got to show it for nobody, you can see that I ball
3 months, fuck the walker, I was struttin 'fore I crawl
Before the old school even had the, ""Yes, yes, ya'll!""
I was spendin my uneven money on my family in the mall
Young Fiend, was the guard, I breaks rules with it
My ? got grooves with it, cause I packs tools with it
I simply acts a fool with it, roll, represent-a
Wear minks in the winter, Tank iced in the center
My step is the agenda, not only this voice
But they its bout my hips, naw they ain't havin my choice
Now the moral to the story is that I'm cold with it
Made a song about my stroll with it
If you was with it, can ya dig it?

Chorus 4x

What up out there kenfo
This be fiend coming at like this here here
I brought a couple of my people with me
Fiend, mac, soulja slim, kane and abel
A couple of no limit soldiers to help me out with this here

Chorus
What cha mean, mean, heard about
Soldiers got some daily clout
Slangin in the dirty south
What we really worried about x2

[soulja slim]
(peep this shit) I know you heard about this nigga from the 3rd
Raw, then a uncut bird with bad tempers and bad nerves
Serve, dope to a dope fiend gotta get more cream
Than the rest of the dealers
Every nigga that I fuck with gotta be from killas
Fill up in this shit, that was ever smokin, you can catch me smokin
On some shit that will have me broken, (cough cough),
I'm so high, I can ride, barely need to slug some dealing
No optimos, no keep moving, fuck it, pass the feeling
Real niggas feel me, cause I'm bout as real as it get
Son or stranger, no love for that studio shit
All my little partners gone, I'll be damned if I g-o
But if I do I'll grab my gun shoot like and pull let em know

Chorus x2

[kane & abel]
You know I'm from the ghetto, hit the glock
And pop my shots clean up your block
Red beam, maintain my aim, bullet holes in your brain
When I stop that motherfucking clock, kane
Usual suspect, down south niggas bout respect
Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette
Like the weed when I lower my tek
Niggas is seeking, pump down like bricks, in the trunk of the 626
Is something you hate cause your boy
Just got flipped, ak with a strong clip
In the hood I bust you with the tank,
In the pen I trust you with the shank
My mind go blank, I'm a soldier smokin dank
All the way to the motherfucking bank

Chorus x2

[mac]
Now what y'all mean, niggas on my team
They all about the cream
And my enemies, we take it to the street
To get the green, knowa mean
Came here with slim, mac and fiend
I still scream woah!
In the drop where my nigga walk
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged
I'm psycho warden I stay on my guard and bitch I never die

Chorus x2

[fiend]
What the world don't know is I'm a hurt
A soldier without a pause
I'm prayin about cause, break jaws and all laws
My bullet scars didn't heal, my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act
I doubt that, I'm strange cause I'm with the right change
After soldier consediration, I'm the live range

Nah, I know, who's that solider, rollin longs nigga
Thicker than Monifah, it's I, capital F-I
The keeper of the reaper
Smokin cheba with my colonel P, Snoop and Mystikal
Pull over, I'm takin pullas
Fucked up, can't ya tell?
Take a smell, let me whiff that
Since God goes, you gone
Tatoos, that can only been choked, seven zones
I'm grown, and well known to be surviving in hell
Hangin round long enough to get through the clouds
It's something by (?)
Got a story to tell
Which is, the life of the baddest
Born from ashes, the smoke of dead, of an addict
Got to have it, cause baby boy, it's a habit
Puff it and fuck some pussy, and see which one I grab quick
I'm that sick, I need weed to proceed
Like a band-aid for a cut, hopin to stop the bleedin
No, not the seeds, I done paid for the pickin
Only the green stickin, for the record

[Chorus:]
[All] (Fiend)
[I'm a smoker]

[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Snoop Dogg]
Ever since my first puff, it seems I couldn't get enough
But I just couldn't quit I had to have another hit
I'm smokin green with a fiend by the age of eighteen
I chop a pound to the ground, went cavi on the triple beam
Once upon a time, before I used to bust rhymes
I had to scratch to get a nickel, in order to get a dime
But times done change, now I'm havin mines
And I'm protected by the tank, No Limit, and plenty nines
I grinds to the fullest, so when I'm finished I gots to pull it
I'm lookin for that green shit, boy you bite the bullet
For tryin to sell me bullshit
You know I'm lookin for the bombest weed in your town
Now, I'm a smoker

Now you know what that mean?
Check this out Fiend, everytime a nigga go outta town
Somebody always approach me talkin bout ""I got the chronic,
We got the chronic."" Muthafucka, chronic ain't brown with
Seeds and stems in the bag nigga. Who got it?

Under twenty five and I caused a killer to die and I'm unemployed
I takes no joy up in another mans pain
But in my mind somehow I hate to find the word called strain
Obtain machan' before you place me in the game
I'm a survivor, watch they holler when I let loose this thang
And I'm swamp and gumbo living
So if y'all niggas coming with 'em, 'fore I rid 'em
Y'all better talk some senses in 'em
Cause new orleans niggas don't yap where I'm from
Bust backs with a gun, up in the club, get to clapping and swung
And my bullets don't hum, they burn
And it ain't no aftermath if you catch a nigga ak'n bad
I make this loud shit sound good, knock on wood
Who am I, little nigga up to no good, out the hood
Watch me show you what I could, I got with a spatch' and a half

My people screamed for revenge 
So Fiend was called upon
Job description was get it on
Protect your mental, heart and your dome
You may die cause' of your tone
Young, black and strong
I was meant and sent
Cause' some of the real was all gone
Since birth til' now I got holes in my T-shirt
From fighting with anybody that wants to see me hurt
Took it needle and blood
Second and first love
Fuck giving a fuck
Blame me not the drugs
I motivates myself
Grab a rocket off my shelf
A extra match and now I'm feeling like myself
Without help I could spot and just kill a decoy
Really end what i destroyed

Wanting to give the baby something to follow
But shit I'm smoking like coffee lids
Trying to deal with what is
Screaming letta nigga live
And don't kick the door in my crib
I was off he even found where I lived
Now is it a crime to be black?
And walk the streets wit' cha' gat?
To protect family knock somebody off the map
Distributing crack to put clothes on they back
I did it, and still do it if that's where I'm at
But see I'm best where I'm at
Up in this sack right into this back wood
Wanting everyday to be that good

For how long?
23 years
And I choose to speak my mind even if its my career
The only fear that i discovered ain't returned and ain't coming
And the faith that I have ain't in no car in no woman
Everyday I'm stumbling to a smarter me
A harder me
Revealing my strength for they try to swallow me
I done read what they didn't want me to read
Learn to need what they didn't want me to need
Shit look I really gotta house full of guns
A couch full of ones
Just in case I don't understand the outcome that life taught
Let me leave you with this thought
Why the lion needed courage and he already had heart....

Look what quickly happened to that yapping niggas I rap
I'm foul, you heard my side of the fucking story
My cousin Tory, with a twenty for me but I wanted the glory
Now spot him I didn't seen, scouted out his team
Get punked, 'fore I jump, bumping that old fiend
Hit a lick and say 'cause, I'm heading to the city 
Incase I don't take him, I think my God won't forgive me
And just because money famous all my cars pretty
Don't mean this star gone balls on getting shitty
I heard this bastard, was repping on some past shit

This right here, is for all my survivors, all of em you know I'm saying
Grow to the way, you know I'm saying
All our soldiers world wide, you know I'm saying
Midwest, Northwest, East, West whatever, South
To all our thugs, you know I'm saying, all the way to United States
New York, I-I gotta get this off my chest one way or another
Go on, speak to 'em

Hate made the child and spoke up, would evolve a ton
And assisted the murder rate, when that revolver run
It's hard to run, when you don't know what you running from
Yeah I own a gun, but that don't mean I can't be the one
To catch ya names, five shot cause he or she was shameless
Leaving me and my people, arm's brainless
Painless as it seem for me, if I was to go now
Tell me who gon fiend for me, dream of me
Speak be having a team for me, survivor nigga
And tell him what it mean to me, my er'thang
I want to end, what the devil bring
And make it to hear, the angels up in heaven sing, until then

[Chorus: x2]
I'm just sitting here, waiting on God
So I could ask him, is life suppose to be this hard
'Cause the true fears, I know he care for me
Just want to know, if there's a place up there for me

At the sun let the moon take over, and every winter get colder
From a struggling tell you, soldier gon speak soldier
But I can't kill the beef, between that side and that coast
And I can't say what's so white, just like black folk
The road is thin, so is hope for black men
Your own even Benzo, glocks I pack twelve's
Acquainted, since I roamed the allies painted
Looking at the hustlers, on the wall they all became famous
Ghetto love, but died as a often it's been thugs
Sold to a under cuff, saw the cuffs and bust
I did the game off 'em, they brainwashed 'em
Wasn't eighteen, now removing the red stains off 'em

[Chorus: x2]

At thirteen y'all know they right from wrong's, that's why I write these songs
For em, to let the ghetto choose to know that Fiend gon speak for 'em
I can't ignore 'em, if my eyes were sowed shut
And my ears were overstuffed with words like, boy I don't give a
I'm not the recipe, just recognizing when he blessing me
And know my gun won't solve, every time he testing me
Until the death of me, I continue on his legacy
Got a bad temper, but won't let it get the best of me
Stressing me, I know we wasn't put here to sell rocks
Be caught up in the system, locked in cell blocks
I think the world shell shocked, these streets is Vietnam
And the dopest thing I did was, put it in this rhyme

New change was burnin inside motherfuckers like hell 
The only precautionary measure was to take care of self 
And that's the only way you can survive in the game 
And enhance in the game but lord I really must say 
Everything has got a message and a meaning to it

Didn't ask to come here but when I landed it sure did hurt 
It was a trip to see my life split in half 
>From the drug game on the street to the love I showed my mom and dad 
The pain run deep, ha, nigga can't you tell 
Look at the expression on my face, nigga it hurts like hell 
I have a testimony to tell, this life I will never forget 
Let me hit this life boy, rearrange my whole shit 
Look, I was riding up Third Street as usual 
I was gonna bust a left buck I'm on a cell but I left shampoo hotel 
Man it hurts me, scene it horrified me 
I seen a group of little kids having fun ya dig 
nobody botherin them see 
Until this chump drove up with his big shot gun 
And he shot a round of kids, I say boy 
what this nigga did (what this nigga did) 
And the little kid that he shot boy on the block, end his life 
And the kid's name was James ??? right, and that's my testimony

Now see in my life, it ain't never been what it's supposed to be 
Sometimes my tank dogs feel like they losing me 
Sometimes I just feel they don't understand me 
Cause in my life you never tell me life will bring so much harm 
I never thought to see my homie ??? die with needles in his arm 
And like my homie Derrell Fuller, he never got to see his twins born 
And by the way they couldn't see it because they bullets they took 
they couldn't take it 
And you couldn't tell me that these days in my life

Irresponsibly, and you've failed to be born before all the world was taken

Tested flawless face
Highrise apartment
A penthouse adorned with grace
Exits her limo
As she steps over the man
Dead on the sidewalk
Jumping suicidal plan
Just a fantasy
Is all she'll ever be
Not what she appears
She is not worth all the tears
But after all is done
She won't be the one
Well you have got to let her go
Cultured circles
She is at the club all day
A dreamer's nightmare
there can never be a way
Off to the islands
With no ordinary guy
No use competing
When you can't afford a ride
She is walking
With her head up in the air
Looks my direction
But my face can't draw a stare

Fighting Gravity,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

My future in her tea leaf eyes
She's the hole in my disguise

Lost among the chosen few

Liberated by the view

Round and round I'm off the ground 
And I can't even hear the sound

Of the boy in me

Step off the ledge into the wind
And never care where we were blown

Everything would turn all right

Of all the castles we got near

And God hears his people calling, praying on their knees
And in the midst of all this darkness he here's his Father's plea

I wander what my future holds for me in You
I pray all day and night
That I would do just what You want me to
I will live my life for You

Just to please You, Father
Is my one desire
It burns in me
Like a blazing fire

Things may come my way
That will try to make me loose my sight of You
But I will stand strong
To what I know is good and true
I will live my life for You
For the rest of my days

Just to please You, Father
Is my one desire
It burns in me
Like a blazing fire
To preach the gospel to the nation
To every tongue and every race
And Lord, just to please You.

Fighting Instinct,"I'll tell You everything I am
I'm lost and lonely
I'm afraid of not knowing when I've lost my way
And now I'm standing still
And I can feel you getting closer
I can feel Your love upon me
Will You light my way

(Chorus)
Will You light my way
So I can see the path beyond the light of day
Will I ever be the same
Will You light my way

A fear of losing what I've gained
Will You help me let it go, let it go
Giving everything I have
I part with nothing that is mine
Does this cost outweigh the cure
Is it more than worth the prize

(Chorus)

I surrender all and I seek Your face

will You light the world
You can light the word
As long as You're in it
As You're in it

As I open my door

And I need You in my heart
I feel You, oh my Lord
And I need You more than ever before

Time and time again You save me
Same as this, that I fall
I might as well be rendered helpless
Cause without You, I'm not at all

I see You, oh my God
And I need You in my heart
I feel You, oh my Lord

I know my motives are pure and true

Won't get you far with me.

Even though I could not name what I was looking for
I thought I had it all worked out
Even though I was feeling the worry and the doubt
I tried to hide behind myself
But You saw right through myself

(Chorus)
You found me first
When I was at my worst
And now I know the love of Jesus Christ
Cause I have You in my life

When I did not know what love was for
It was the very key that opened my heart's door
I thought this peace was just a dream
Like there wasn't anything like this for me
I searched this world and all I found was lies
And then You opened up my eyes

(Chorus)

All these years I could not find the truth
All these times I could not see
All these years I could not find You
And all this time You were watching over me

(Chorus)




",You Found Me First
Fighting Instinct,"I thought my world was complete
I was living a life made on shaky ground
I was blinded, so I couldn't see
I couldn't stand, I thought I was drowning

I thought I was sinking
I thought I was dying

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

Some nights I would lie all alone
Dreaming of you and the way things had been
You know I had no chance on my own
Now I can make it with you next to me

Now we are together
Now I found forever

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

Somehow you came
And took all my pain away
I know that I can't
Repay all the love you gave
All the love that you gave

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

I found, I found forever
I found forever in your arms
I found, I found forever
I don't decide where I feel free
Where I feel free

It came down to save us
(Untouched open)
And end it all

Cause I'm under the outside
And over all

Cause I'm a thousand miles away
And I'm out of oxygen
And now I'm falling faster than
I'd like to to be

And I'm closer to the sky
Than I'll ever be to you again
Find the exits signs and disappear

We were hated
It seems we were all wrong

(Find me bleeding)
We looked up to lose
(Peacefulness)
Our way again

Cause I'm under the outside
And over all

Cause I'm a thousand miles away
And I'm out of oxygen
And now I'm falling faster than
I'd like to to be

And I'm close to the sky
Than I'll ever be to you again
Find the exit signs and disappear

Some things don't
(Change)

Fall

(Born from angels)
Let's star this all over again
With the same generation

And not keep us around
I won't wait
I won't mind
Not this time

I've started up the clocks
It's time I left behind
And everything we've lost
Disappears

(I'm calling, I'm calling out)
(for answers on the long walk home)

I've started up the race
It's something I can't change
And now we're not the same

I'm running past the words
To finish up the faults (can't come back)
I won't wait (won't live like that)

To communicate,

When you try to see,
What you mean to me.

It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time

Until we break,
And you'll be gone
Until the rain fall starts
Until the lightning strikes your heart

I'll be searching on

I'll find you
I'll take you there
I'll be fine
I'll be fine

We missed a generation.

Fightstar,"I know you've got choices to make
I hope you make them well
It only takes a click of the wrist
I hope you live to tell

We cannot build upon over what you are without..

And you,
You amaze us all,
With the hope that you bring,
It could save us all,
From the war.

I know we've got changes to make
I hope we'll see this through
It only takes a slip of the fist
It ends with me and you

We cannot build upon over what you are without the sin
To cross the five stone

And you,
You amaze us all,
With the hope that you bring,
It could save us all,
From the war.

It all ends with you

You,
You amaze us all,
With the hope that you bring,
It could save us all,
From the war.

And you,
You amaze us all,
With the hope that you bring,
It could save us all,
