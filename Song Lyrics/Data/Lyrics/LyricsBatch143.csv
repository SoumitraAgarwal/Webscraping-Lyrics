Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Sellotape is sticky
Now there's a surprise
Next they'll tell you you can see out of your eyes
Mummified mummies daddies little girl

Had the operation then became an earl
Once you would have kissed her gently on the cheek
Now she kisses you beginning with your feet
Roles that are reversing so misunderstood

Kids who think monogamy is a piece of wood
Ooh but two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed

These days as a woman you are out of place
If you're not a lesbian whose friends are gays
Anything is normal normal is of course
Getting married after planning your divorce

Usually I don't go much at all on twins
Once you've seen the one you've seen them both I think
Mind you when they're pretty pretty as a peach
Whose to say that on the day with one of each

Ooh two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed
I look like I want to look I wear what I like

It won't be a suit and no it won't be a tie
A tie is a dead heat not a knot round your neck
Neck is what you do when
Alone with your girlfriend

Ooh but two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed
Two's company three is allowed",Two's Company (Three Is Allowed) [UK Single Mix]
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I don't know if you've heard the news but I'm a boy
Who's got himself a problem so big it's no joy
You see I've something that people claim
Could bring me fortune and instant fame
A face so ugly you could hardly blame 
Anybody here for saying so

I think I'll bury myself deep beneath the ground
And come up only when there's no one else around
And if by chance someone approaches me
And that someone happens to be a she
You can bet your life in time of worry
I wouldn't hesitate but to be that way

Oh why can't girls just look at me and smile
Instead of looking at me as though 
I will turn my head and before I go to bed 
Gaily underneath the blanket go

I've even wrote to Marjorie Proops, but she can't help
The best that she could offer me was disguise yourself
Well this I've done would you believe not twice
But more than once in fact I think it was nice
So much so when I'm inclined to hurry
I wouldn't hesitate but to be that way-oh oh oh

Woh! Woh!

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Let the water music
Take you to the brim
Let the water music
Take you for a swim

Be of a bay
Let the crowd around you
Sink down a hole

Jump into it and it opens up wide
Off your shoulder
It can carry the weight

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Young at heart we may he only
Young at heart hut we're not Lonely
If anything we're never in but we're out
Young at heart if we are only
Young at heart then let us slowly
Unwind our say only way we know how
Young at heart
You can so easily become a part
Of any new fangled dancing craze
Like the way that you did
When we were kids

We're the first to admit we're at that stage
Even though we might act our age
Young at heart we'll always remain

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Went and left me on my own before
Said you don't want me round anymore
Found some other fool to come and care for you
Now you're back and though my heart is sad

You still want me but girl I'm still mad at you
So baby don't bother at all
When I see you walking down the street
I feel so sorry for the one you meet

Now I know what you are like and what you can do
That was then and now you're at my door
What can I tell you that I haven't before, we're through
So baby don't bother at all

From a bird's eye view to a T-bone steak
From above to below the human race
Have about as much respect for each other as we demand
To the moon to the wrong southside of you

Still remember how you used to care
Take you with me almost everywhere
Seems so funny to think that you'd be untrue
But the day you ran away with him

You made a fool of me and that I think is cruel
So baby don't bother at all
A bed of roses suppose it doesn't exist
Would you believe,I believe that believing in this

Is like a suit on a groom and the bride he's going to wed
Well instead go asleep in separate beds
Went and left me on my own before
Said you don't want me 'round anymore

Found another fool to come and care for you
Now you're back and though my heart is sad
You still want me but honey I'm still mad at you

So baby don't bother at all
So baby don't bother at all
So baby don't bother at all",Don't Bother at All

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Everybody knows that the world is round
That is everybody 'cept me
'Cause I ain't been told
So why should I be forced to believe

That the feet I wear are meant to bear
Pieces of leather that shine
No that can't be true
'Cause I can't find a piece to fit mine

When I walk downtown
Dressed up like a clown
People they just burst into tears
Lift their heads and whisper in my ears

Cover up your toes 'cause everybody knows
When I walk downtown
Dressed up like a clown
People they just burst into tears

Lift their heads and whisper in my ears
Cover up your toes 'cause everybody knows
That the state we're in
Is about to begin

And if that's not enough

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Well come on everybody it is time we were going
I've got a whole lot of loving and it's suddenly growing
I get up, I go out, I come in, roundabout
After that ain't no doubt

You can never skin a rabbit when he's off and running
(In other words)
He's so cunning
I say love what you doing if you don't mind me asking

You either lead me to ruin or leading me in passing
Either way I propose with a ring I suppose
After that heaven knows
No matter how you go about it

It's the same old story
(In other words)
Love and glory
(In other words)

Same old story
(In other words)
Love no glory

Don't mind people eating fast-food
Don't give a damn about the damn cube
Except when a kid of maybe nine demontrates how
You get up, go to school

Pay attention to rules
If you're smart don't be cruel
You can never for what ever reason
Move a mountain
(In other words)

Just go around them
(In other words)
Move a mountain
(In other words)

Just go round them
Don't mind people eating fast-food
Don't give a damn about the damn cube
Well come on everybody it is time we were going

I said I love what you're ruin but I can't what you're growing
I get up, I go out, I come in, roundabout

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Save it for your children
This love that you have got
Forget me now that I am sure
It's you that I want not

Save if for your loved
Ones who come to you each day
No matter what you do to them
They'll never have to say

That I don't love you any more
Still I don't care
Somebody else can love you more
I won't be there

Save it for another
Who's asking for your love
The only one who knows the truth
Will never know enough

Save it for the priest Then who might one day say to you
""Do you take this man for your husband?""
Answer him ""I do""
And you'll be happy

Just like I was when I left you
There's only one thing
Left for me to do forget you
And I will so help me

Ever if it means that I'll have to
Take a trip abroad
Where it's thought perhaps the change
Might do me good from you it should

Save it for the morning
That starts another day
If you have learnt your lesson
Someone else won't have to pay

Save it and remember
Your carefree days are through
No longer can you take somebody
And break his heart in two

For everyone knows
That you treated me unfair
Although I think about you inside me
I don't care anymore",Save It
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I don't want you hanging round outside my door
I don't want you hanging round anymore

Baby please baby please baby one time

Tell me why anyway you want to
Tell me why anyway you choose
Tell me why anyway you want to

Please baby please baby this time baby
Please baby please baby why don't you try
You've got to be honest if our love's to pay
You've got to be truthful in no other way

If you'd only tell me why you cheated and lied
Baby please baby please baby one more time
Tell me why anyway you want to

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I had a woman that loved me true
To cut a long story short
We got married on our honeymoon
To cut a long story short

Now we're together I'm afraid no more
To cut a long story short
Like billions of other people we're divorced
To cut a long story short

I don't believe that you can possibly
Give more than you get
Unless you talk about taxation
And the money that you care to bet

When I've got a problem I want to solve
To cut a long story short
I simply go out and have a game of golf
To cut a long story short

But I read a book that the book was great
To cut a long story short
It got a fine class of people like the chambermaid
To cut a long story short

I don't see how you could possibly
Take what you can get
When to get what you take
And man you really got to sweat

I don't believe that you can possibly
Give more than you get
Unless you talk about taxation
And the money that you care to bet

I've got a girlfriend her name is Jill
To cut a long story short
She doesn't take chances
So she takes the pill

To cut a long story short
I'm really positive that she is mine
To cut a long story short
Now I'm getting married for the second time

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"She could take a leaf upon a tree and turn it into gold
Just as she could take a piece of rope which on its own will fold

You could be surprised to see the sort of things that she can bake

In every way with quality she's perfect

Remember she can break your heart in two
But she'll put it back, glue it together, make it look brand new

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I never thought that I'd live to see the day
Here I am in love and the feeling is great
And nothing can persuade me
Than to give a rest
And when I see your love-light I suggest

You better run
You better hide
And baby don't you know
It but the moment's arrive
You better run
You better hide
Cause the truth don't matter
The man's gonna get you inside

Met for the first time
Thought you were great
Met for the next
Then I knew right away
Nothing can excite me
The way you can
And when I get that feeling
Tired as I am

You better run
You better hide
And baby don't you know but the moment's arrive
You better run
You better hide Cause I 'm not gonna sit around
Waiting my turn
Always been a weakness
Far as I'm concerned

This time I'm gonna take the fall
Don't say that you're not the one
Gonna grab you by the horns
By the horns

Been a lot hearts
Beating well out of time
Nothing odd about that
One of them is mine
The temperature is raising, heat up the floor
And when I see your love lights starting glow

You better run
You better hide
And baby don't you know it but the moment you rise
You better run
You better hide
Cause the truth don't matter where the lie's considered
If you have a tendency to get burned

My reasons for chasing you
Are very easy to describe
Everything that you have I like
Everything that you have I like

Never thought I get so I couldn't sit down
Never thought I feel so like running around
You and me is cool as you think that you are
But when I see your love light
Enter my heart

You better hide
And baby don't you know it but the moment's arrive
You better run

And baby don't you know it but the moment's arrive

You better hide

You've got something on your mind
Because I've seen it there
So many time before

[Chorus]
And you don't have to tell me
Just what it is that's on your mind
For I'm inclined to agree with me
There must be something wrong

I stand at ease
Won't dislocate my arm
But what could
What easily would break my heart
If you imply that this time I'm sorry
I have gone too far

Have you ever wondered just what it is
More perhaps than just a moment of bliss

Is it all the things you'd like to have been
All the places that you haven't yet seen

But I honestly don't know

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying ""to you too""

Now just across the lawn is Pat
Sitting on his favorite hat
Waiting for the barber to arrive
And if he doesn't come today
Pat will shout (hip-hip-hooray)
Ain't it grand to be alive

When every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying ""to you too""

Now lying on the garden fence
Is a man (at great expense)
History tells us will outgrow his youth
But only until such a time
He finds out why he's been lying
And then of course he'll tell the truth

Cause every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do - ya do

Now down among the partridge trees
Lives a man who loves his knees
So much so he's framed them in a jar
And if by chance one should escape
And to put on must in it's place
With half a pound of shredded tar

Cause every day's a holiday in Mr.Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon

Gilberto Gil,"Quando olhaste bem nos olhos meus
E o teu olhar era de adeus, juro que não acreditei
Eu te estranhei, me debrucei
Sobre o teu corpo e duvidei
E me arrastei, e te arranhei

E me agarrei nos teus cabelos
Nos teus pelos, teu pijama
Nos teus pés, ao pé da cama
Sem carinho, sem coberta
No tapete atrás da porta
Reclamei baixinho

Dei pra maldizer o nosso lar
Pra sujar teu nome, te humilhar
E me vingar a qualquer preço
Te adorando pelo avesso
Pra mostrar que ainda sou tua
Até provar que ainda sou tua",Atrás Da Porta

Não bate o meu coração
O mar onde o céu flutua
Onde morre o sol e a lua
E acaba o caminho do chão
Nasci numa onda verde
Na espuma me batizei
Vim trazido numa rede
Na areia me enterrarei
Na areia me enterrarei

Ou então nasci na palma
Palha da palma no chão
Tenho a alma de água clara
Meu braço espalhado em praia
Meu braço espalhado em praia

E o mar na palma da mão
No cais, na beira do cais
Senti o meu primeiro amor
E num cais que era só um cais
Somente mar ao redor
Somente mar ao redor

Mas o mar não é todo mar
Mar que em todo mundo exista
O melhor, é o mar do mundo
De um certo ponto de vista
De onde só se avista o mar
A ilha de Itaparica

A Bahia é que é o cais
A praia, a beira, a espuma
E a Bahia só tem uma
Costa clara, litoral
Costa clara, litoral

É por isso que é o azul
Cor de minha devoção
Não qualquer azul, azul
De qualquer céu, qualquer dia
O azul de qualquer poesia
De samba tirado em vão
É o azul que agente fita
No azul do mar da Bahia
É a cor que lá principia
E que habita em meu coração
E que habita em meu coração",Beira-Mar

Como as mãos de um lavrador ativo

Como acidente em forno radioativo 
Às vezes, só porque fico nervoso 
Às vezes, somente porque eu estou vivo

A cada sensação de abatimento 
Rebento, o coração dizendo: ""Bata""

Adotaram Senhor do Bonfim:
Tanto resistência, quanto rendição

Quando, hoje, alguns preferem condenar
O sincretismo e a miscigenação
Parece que o fazem por ignorar
Os modos caprichosos da paixão

Paixão, que habita o coração da natureza-mãe
E que desloca a história em suas mutações
Que explica o fato da Branca de Neve amar
Não a um, mas a todos os sete anões

Pela mania da compreensão
Ainda hoje andei tentando decifrar
Algo que li que estava escrito numa pichação
Que agora eu resolvi cantar
Neste samba em forma de refrão:

""Bob Marley morreu
Porque além de negro era judeu
Michael Jackson ainda resiste
Porque além de branco ficou triste""","De Bob Dylan a Bob Marley, Um Samba Provocacao"
Gilberto Gil,"Ouça o que eu tenho a dizer
Tome o que eu tenho pra dar
Se não servir pra você
Atire tudo no mar

Diga o que você disser
Sei que não vou me importar
Faça o que você fizer
Não deixarei de te amar

Onde você mora
Mora o meu coração
Quando você chora
Chora tudo que é olho
Da minha solidão

Se você namora
Ora, meu Deus
Que feliz deve ser
O mortal que provar
Desse mel que escorrer
Dos teus lábios, então",Mulher de Coronel
Gilberto Gil,"Toda saudade é a presença
Da ausência de alguém
De algum lugar
De algo enfim
Súbito o não
Toma forma de sim
Como se a escuridão
Se pusesse a luzir
Da própria ausência de luz
O clarão se produz
O sol na solidão

Toda saudade é um capuz
Transparente
Que veda
E ao mesmo tempo
Traz a visão
Do que não se pode ver
Porque se deixou pra trás
Mas que se guardou no coração",Toda Saudade
Gilberto Gil,"Lá em Londres, vez em quando me sentia longe daqui
Vez em quando, quando me sentia longe, dava por mim
Puxando o cabelo nervoso, querendo ouvir Celly Campelo pra não cair

Naquela fossa em que vi um camarada
Meu de Portobello cair
Naquela falta de juízo que eu não
Tinha nem uma razão pra curtir
Naquela ausência de calor, de cor, de sal,
De sol, de coração pra sentir
Tanta saudade preservada num velho baú de prata dentro de mim
Digo num baú de prata porque prata é a luz do luar
Do luar que tanta falta me fazia junto do mar
Mar da Bahia cujo verde vez em quando me fazia bem relembrar
Tão diferente do verde também tão lindo dos gramados campos de lá
Ilha do Norte onde não sei se por sorte ou por castigo dei deparar
Por algum tempo que afinal passou depressa, como tudo tem de passar
Hoje eu me sinto como se ter ido fosse necessário para voltar
Tanto mais vivo de vida mais vivida, dividida pra lá e pra cá

Que a coisa virou confusão
No salão
Porque parei, procurei
Não encontrei
Nem mais um sinal de emoção
Em seu olhar

Aí eu me desesperei
E a coisa virou confusão
No salão
Porque lembrei
Do seu sorriso aberto
Que era tão perto, que era tão perto
Em um carnaval que passou
Porque lembrei
Que esse frevo rasgado
Foi naquele tempo passado
O frevo que você gostou
E dançou e pulou

Foi quando topei com você
Que a coisa virou confusão
No salão
Porque parei, procurei
Não encontrei
Nem mais um sinal de emoção
Em seu olhar

A coisa virou confusão
Sem briga, sem nada demais
No salão

Louvo a esperança da gente
Na vida, pra ser melhor
Quem espera sempre alcança
Três vezes salve a esperança!

Procede bem quem não pára

Louvo a força do homem
E a beleza da mulher
Louvo a paz pra haver na terra
Louvo o amor que espanta a guerra

Louvo a amizade do amigo
Que comigo há de morrer
Louvo a vida merecida

Louvo a luta repetida
Da vida pra não morrer

Louvo a casa onde se mora
De junto da companheira
Louvo o jardim que se planta
Pra ver crescer a roseira
Louvo a canção que se canta
Pra chamar a primavera

Louvo quem canta e não canta
Porque não sabe cantar
Mas que cantará na certa
Quando enfim se apresentar
O dia certo e preciso
De toda a gente cantar

E assim fiz a louvação louvação, louvação
Do que vi pra ser louvado ser louvado, ser louvado

Gilberto Gil,"Poetas, seresteiros, namorados, correi 
É chegada a hora de escrever e cantar 
Talvez as derradeiras noites de luar 
Momento histórico, simples resultado do desenvolvimento da ciência viva 
Afirmação do homem normal, gradativa sobre o universo natural 
Sei lá que mais 
Ah, sim! Os místicos também profetizando em tudo o fim do mundo 
E em tudo o início dos tempos do além 
Em cada consciência, em todos os confins 
Da nova guerra ouvem-se os clarins 
Guerra diferente das tradicionais, guerra de astronautas nos espaços siderais 
E tudo isso em meio às discussões, muitos palpites, mil opiniões 
Um fato só já existe que ninguém pode negar, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, já! 
E lá se foi o homem conquistar os mundos lá se foi 
Lá se foi buscando a esperança que aqui já se foi 
Nos jornais, manchetes, sensação, reportagens, fotos, conclusão: 
A lua foi alcançada afinal, muito bem, confesso que estou contente também 
A mim me resta disso tudo uma tristeza só 
Talvez não tenha mais luar pra clarear minha canção 
O que será do verso sem luar? 
O que será do mar, da flor, do violão? 
Tenho pensado tanto, mas nem sei

É chegada a hora de escrever e cantar",Lunik 9

Acreditam nas coisas lá do céu 
As mulheres cantando, tiram versos 
Os homens escutando, tiram o chapéu 
Ellis vivem penando aqui na terra 
Esperando o que Jesus prometeu 

E Jesus prometeu vida melhor 
Pra quem vive nesse mundo sem amor 
Só depois de entregar o corpo ao chão 
Só depois de morrer neste sertão 
Eu também tô do lado de Jesus 
Só que acho que ele se esqueceu 
De dizer que na terra a gente tem 
De arranjar um jeitinho pra viver 

Muita gente se arvora a ser Deus 
E promete tanta coisa pro sertão 
Que vai dar um vestido pra Maria 
E promete um roçado pro João 
Entra ano, sai ano, e nada vem

Cá na terra isto tem que se acabar",Procissão

Porque todo tamarindo tem 
O seu agosto azedo 
Cedo, antes que o janeiro 
Doce manga venha ser também 
Abacateiro 
Serás meu parceiro solitário 
Nesse itinerário 
Da leveza pelo are

Tu me ensina a fazer renda 
Que eu te ensino a namorar

Gilberto Gil,"Alguma coisa acontece no meu coração
Que só quando cruza a Ipiranga e a Avenida São
João É que quando eu cheguei por aqui
Eu nada entendi
Da dura poesia concreta de tuas esquinas
Da deselegância discreta de tuas meninas
Ainda não havia para mim Rita Lee
A tua mais completa tradução
Alguma coisa acontece no meu coração
Que só quando cruza a Ipiranga e a Avenida
São João
Quando eu te encarei frente a frente
Não vi o meu rosto
Chamei de mal gosto
O que vi de mal gosto, mau gosto
É que narciso acha feio o que não é espelho
E a mente apavora que ainda não é mesmo velho
Nada do que não era antes
Quando não somos mutantes
E foste um difícil começo
Afasto o que não conheço
E que vem de outro sonho feliz de cidade
Aprende depressa a chamar-te de realidade
Por que é o avesso do avesso
Do avesso do avesso.
Do povo oprimido nas filas
Nas vilas, favelas
Da força da grana que ergue
E destrói coisas belas
Da feia fumaça que sobe
Apagando as estrelas
Eu vejo surgir teus poetas
De campos, espaços
Tuas oficinas de florestas
Teus deuses da chuva Pan Américas
De Áfricas Utópicas
Do mundo do samba
Mais possível novo Quilombo de Zumbi
Que os novos baianos passeiam
Na tua garoa Que novos baianos te podem curtir
Numa boa",Sampa

Garoto de Ipanema
Já salvou um menino
Na Praia, no Recife
Nesse dia Momó também estava com a gente

Levou-se o menino
Pra uma clínica em frente
E o médico não quis
Vir atender a gente
Nessa hora nosso sangue ficou bem quente

Menino morrendo
Era aquela agonia
E o doutor só queria
Mediante dinheiro
Nessa hora vi quanto o mundo está doente

Discutiu-se muito
Ameaçou-se briga
Doze litros de água
Tiraram da barriga
Do menino que sobreviveu finalmente

Se essa estória aconteceu
Aconteceu minha gente
Quem está contando sou eu
Aconteceu e acontece

Aconteceu e acontece

Melhor considerar o dito por não dito e dizer

E como é perigosa a minha afirmação
Sair do movimento bem que pode ser um tormento

Oh, se soubessem o que sei 
Não amavam, não passavam 
Aquilo que já passei 
Por meu olhos, por meus sonhos 
Por meu sangue, tudo enfim 
É que eu peço 
A esses moços 
Que acreditem em mim 
Se eles julgam que há um lindo futuro 
Só o amor nesta vida conduz 
Saibam que deixam o céu por ser escuro 
E vão ao inferno à procura de luz

Essa mania e muito me custou 
Pois só as mágoas que eu trago no peito 
E estas rugas que o amor me deixou",Esses Moços (Pobres Moços)

Ainda não são
Tão doces e polpudos quanto as peras
Da tua ilusão
Amarra o teu arado a uma estrela
E os tempos darão
Safras e safras de sonhos
Quilos e quilos de amor
Noutros planetas risonhos
Outras espécies de dor

Se os campos cultivados neste mundo
São duros demais
E os solos assolados pela guerra
Não produzem a paz

E aí tu serás

O camponês solto nos céus
E quanto mais longe da terra
Tanto mais longe de Deus",Amarra O Teu Arado a Uma Estrela

Mas este mundo é feito de maldade e ilusão

Ai, se eu escutasse hoje não sofria
Ai, esta saudade dentro do meu peito
Ai, se ter saudade é ter algum defeito
Eu pelo menos mereço o direito
De ter alguém com quem eu possa me confessar

E veja como sofre um homem infeliz
Que teve que desabafar
Dizendo a todo o mundo o que ninguém diz

E o povo lá embaixo espera
Nas filas dos pontos de ônibus

Que olha tão longe, além
Com os braços sempre abertos
Mas sem proteger ninguém
Eu vou forrar as paredes
Do meu quarto de miséria
Com manchetes de jornal
Pra ver que não é nada sério
Eu vou dar o meu desprezo

Que a tristeza é uma maneira
Da gente se salvar depois

O tempo que a voz não fala
Mas que o coração tributa

E agora bis

Agora que é tudo escuro

Dentro de um figo maduro
Aqui longe em nova deli
Agora sete, oito ou nove

Amor é tudo que move
O melhor lugar do mundo é aqui,
E agora bis

Deixe a sua meta fora da disputa
Meta dentro e fora, lata absoluta
Deixe-a simplesmente metáfora",Metáfora [Metaphor]
Gilberto Gil,"Pôs na boca, provou, cuspiu

Uma banda da banda é umbanda
Outra banda da banda é cristã
Outra banda da banda é kabala
Outra banda da banda é koorão

E então, e então, são quantas bandas?
Tantas quantas pedir meu coração
E o meu coração pediu assim só
Bim-bom, bim-bim-bom, bim-bão

Todo mundo na ampla discussão
O neuro-cientista, o economista
Opinião de alguém que está na pista
Opinião de alguém fora da lista
Opinião de alguém que diz não
Ou se alarga essa banda e a banda anda
Mais ligeiro pras bandas do sertão

Ou então não, não adianta nada
Banda vai, banda fica abandonada
Deixada para outra encarnação

Ou então não, não adianta nada
Uma vai outra fica abandonada
Os problemas não terão solução
Piraí, Piraí, Piraí
Piraí bandalargou-se há pouquinho
Piraí infoviabilizou
Os ares do município inteirinho
Por certo que a medida provocou
Um certo vento de redemoinho

Diabo do menino agora quer
Um Ipod e um computador novinho
O certo é que o sertão quer navegar
No micro do menino internetinho

O Netinho baiano e bom cantor
Já faz tempo tornou-se um provedor – provedor de acesso
À grande rede www
Esse menino ainda vira um sábio
Contratado do Google, sim sinhô
Diabliu de menino internetinho
Sozinho vai descobrindo o caminho
O rádio fez assim com o seu avô
Rodovia, Hidrovia,
Ferrovia e agora chegando a infovia
Pra alegria de todo o interior
Meu Brasil, meu Brasil, bem brasileiro
O You Tube chegando aos seus grotões

Gilberto Gil,"Desde o tempo do carro de boi
Da época do trem motriz
Do auge dos canaviais

Tens vivido a semear a luz
A paz e o amor que tem raiz 
Na índia dos teus ancestrais

Vida cheia de momentos raros
Nesta cara Santo Amaro
Terra de doces paixões

Zeca e todas as meninas 
E os meninos, quantos sinos
Quantos hinos, quantas orações

Has de ouvir de nós
Sempre essa voz
Sempre essa voz
Sempre em tom de louvor

Nossa emoção, canô
Nesta canção, canô
Nossa emoção, nesta canção

Parabéns pra você, canô
Cem anos com você, canô
Parabéns pra você, canô

Gilberto Gil,"Ela me disse que iria se casar
Perguntei-lhe se haveria despedida de solteira
Ela me disse que a principio não
Pelo visto não
Certamente não

Porque não, eu insisti em perguntar
Ela disse que eu devia já estar pensando em besteira
Eu disse a ela que a princípio não
Pelo visto não
Certamente não

E assim nossa prosa prosseguiria
O assunto era instigante, o horizonte promissor
Excitante para um cabra tão galante
Intrigante para uma cabrita em flor

Tanta coisa que ali se discutia
Fidelidade, virgindade, orientação sexual
No final ela admitiria que faria
A despedida de solteira e coisa e tal

Festa na qual eu por sinal 
Não entraria não
Nem eu nem qualquer um outro varão
Nossa cabrita, tão catita, tão bonita
Depois de tanta desdita havia feito uma opção
Se casaria com outra linda cabrita, hah!
Que até bem pouco namorara o meu irmão

O pau de arara do meu pai o que diria disso
Que ela me disse, disso que ela me disse",Despedida de Solteira
Gilberto Gil,"Não sou de queixa
Mas a gueixa me iludiu
Logo de cara, umeboshi
Uma ameixa salgada
Quieto, seu mano engoliu
Um forte impacto no ilíaco
Mas se era afrodisíaco, tudo bem
Gueixa não é sempre que se tem assim 
Depois ela serviu, sake, sushi, nato, tofu
Como encontrar apetite pra tanto palpite no menu
Não sei se vinha da ameixa mas a deixa era
Luzes, câmera, ação !
Não aguentava mais meu coração

Minha gueixa no tatame
Parecia um camafeu
Uma gueixa no tatame
E eu ali perto do céu
Olhei pra ela e disse
Sonho, sonho meu
Nesse mesmo instante
Incontinente ela adormeceu
Não foi possível libertá-la do morfeu",Gueixa No Tatame
Gilberto Gil,"Máquina de ritmo 
Tão prática, tão fácil de ligar 
Nada além de um bom botão
Sob a leve pressão do polegar
Poderei legar um dicionário
De compassos pra você
No futuro você vai tocar
Meu samba duro sem querer

Máquina de Ritmo 
Quem dança nessa dança digital
Será por exemplo 
Que o meu surdo ficará mudo afinal 
Pendurado como um dinossauro 
No museu do Carnaval 
Se você aposta que a resposta é sim 
Por Deus mande um sinal

Máquina de Ritmo 
Programação de sons sequenciais 
Mais de cem milhões de bambas 
De escolas de samba virtuais 
Virtuais, virtuosas vertentes 
De variações sem fim 
Daí por diante sambe avante 
Já sem precisar de mim

Máquina de ritmo 
Quem sabe um bom pó de pirlimpimpim 
Possa deletar a dor de quem 
Deixou de lado o tamborim 
Apesar do seu computador 
Ter samba bom, samba ruim 
Se aperto o botão, meu coração 
Há de dizer que é samba sim

Máquina de ritmo 
Processo de algoritmos padrões 
Múltiplos binários e ternários 
Quarternários sem paixões 
Colcheias, semi-colcheias
Fusas, semi-fusas, sensações 
Nos salões das noites cariocas 
Novas tecno-ilusões

Máquina de ritmo 
Que os pós-eternos hão de silenciar 
Novos anjos do inferno vão 
Por qualquer coisa em seu lugar 
Quem sabe irão lhe trocar por um 
Tal surdo mudo do museu 
E Bandos da lua virão se encontrar 
Numa praia toda lua cheia pra lembrar você e eu

Moreno, Domenico, Cassim 
Assim meus filhos, filhos seus 
E Bandos da lua virão se encontrar 
Numa praia toda lua cheia pra lembrar 
Só pra lembrar 
Só pra cantar
Só pra tocar 
Só pra lembrar

Gilberto Gil,"Não tenho medo da morte
Mas sim medo de morrer
Qual seria a diferença
Você há de perguntar
É que a morte já é depois
Que eu deixar de respirar
Morrer ainda é aqui
Na vida, no sol, no ar
Ainda pode haver dor 
Ou vontade de mijar

A morte já é depois
Já não haverá ninguém
Como eu aqui agora
Pensando sobre o além
Já não haverá o além 
O além já será então
Não terei pé nem cabeça
Nem fígado, nem pulmão
Como poderei ter medo
Se não terei coração?

Não tenho medo da morte
Mas medo de morrer, sim
A morte e depois de mim
Mas quem vai morrer sou eu
O derradeiro ato meu
E eu terei de estar presente
Assim como um presidente
Dando posse ao sucessor
Terei que morrer vivendo
Sabendo que já me vou

Então nesse instante sim
Sofrerei quem sabe um choque
Um piripaque, ou um baque
Um calafrio ou um toque
Coisas naturais da vida
Como comer, caminhar
Morrer de morte matada
Morrer de morte morrida
Quem sabe eu sinta saudade
Como em qualquer despedida",Não Tenho Medo Da Morte
Gilberto Gil,"O oco do mundo pré
Para trans e meta pós
O oco do mundo a foz
De um rio sem nascente
Como um broto sem semente
Um raio de sol sem luz
Como infecção sem pus
O oco do mundo a sós

O oco do mundo ainda
Na minha periferia 
Como eco da Bahia
Saudade do meu sertão
O oco do mundo inteiro
Passando pela tangente
Ainda na minha frente
Como um campo de visão

O oco do mundo vem
Se aproximando de mim
Primeiro como calor
Depois como frenesi 
Em seguida como odor
E logo como tremor
O oco do mundo vem
Se aproximando de mim

O oco do mundo então
Já no meu interior
Pedaço de pau na mão
Fazendo de mim tambor
Batendo tirando som
E sangue e suor e horror
O oco do mundo então
Encarnação do terror

O oco do mundo sai
Vai se por por traz de mim
Depois de me haver cruzado
A alma e o corpo presente
Depois de engolir-me a mente
E sugar o meu passado
O oco do mundo sai
No futuro projetado

O oco do mundo fora
Do alcance da linguagem
O oco do mundo imagem
Sem espelho, sem suporte
O oco do mundo a morte
Sem corpo, sem substrato
Sem noção, sem aparato
Como o azar sem a sorte

O oco do mundo em si
Despido de qualquer veste
Nem cão nem cabra da peste
Nem anjo nem mãe de deus
Opaco buraco negro
Sem casca caroço ou ego
O oco do mundo cego
Sozinho em seu próprio céu

O oco do mundo enfim
O oco do mundo além
Além do mal e do bem
Da verdade nua e crua
Além do saber dos sábios
Além do deus dos snobs
O oco do mundo é o bobs
No cabelo da perua",O Oco Do Mundo

Se a barra mundo pesou
O mundo sabe o que faz

Sabe que o mar leva e traz
Sabe quem mata o rapaz
Sabe do filme em cartaz
Sabe da soja em Goiás
Sabe que o amor é fugaz
Sabe amar os animais
Sabe que a gula é voraz
Sabe que paga o que faz",Marmundo
Gilberto Gil,"Não tenho medo da vida, mas, sim, medo de viver
Eis a loucura assumida, você há de imaginar
É que a vida atou-se a mim desde o dia em que eu nasci
Viver tornou-se, outrossim, o modo de desatar
Viver tornou-se o dever de me desembaraçar

A vida é somente um dom independente de quem
Seja capaz de gritar seu nome, alto e bom som
A vida seria um tom, uma altura a se atingir
Viver é saber subir, alcançar a nota lá
Lá no ponto de ferir, se preciso, até sangrar

Não tenho medo da vida, mas medo de viver, sim
A vida é um dado em si, mas viver é que é o nó
Toda vez que vejo um nó, sempre me assalta o temor
Saberei como afrouxá-lo, desatá-lo eu saberei?
A vida é simples, eu sei, mas viver traz tanta dor!

A dor na carne e na alma, a calma a se propagar
A durar dia após dia, a varar noite, a dormir
A ver o amor a vir a ser, a ter e a tornar
A amanhecer de novo e de novo um novo dia
Isso às vezes me agonia, às vezes me faz chorar",Não Tenho Medo Da Vida
Gilberto Gil,"Logo cedo, pé na estrada
Pra não ter porém
Pra não ter noite passada
Pra não ter ninguém 
Atrás
Mais ninguém
Vou pra quem
Vai me ver noutra cidade
No norte da saudade, que eu vou ver meu bem
Meu bem, meu bem
Vai me ver noutra cidade
No norte da saudade, que eu vou ver meu bem
Meu bem, meu bem",Norte Da Saudade
Gilberto Gil,"Não é casal porque não são casados
Não é um par porque logo são três, ou mais
O fato é que já estão acostumados
Namoradas, namorados vários de uma vez

Muita performance, muita parada
Muita balada, muito forrozão
Não tem romance, não tem paixão frustrada
De vale night não precisam não

É vale dia e noite, é vale noite e dia
Vale pro carnaval, vale pro São João
Vale pro Rio, pra São Paulo, pra Bahia
Vale pro Ceará, vale pro Maranhão

A pegadora e o livre pegador, que amor
Que amor pra eles é amor pletora

Gilberto Gil,"Como todos vocês
Eu faço tudo igual todo dia vinte e seis
Como todos vocês
Eu passo bem ou mal todo dia vinte seis

É que só no meu caso especial
Por acaso, aqui, pra mais dois ou três
Vinte e seis virou dia de natal
E nesse caso junho foi o mês

Hoje, portanto, já que eu viajei
Esse tanto pra vir me apresentar

Eu vou cantar parabéns pra vocês

Eu vou cantar um parabéns baião",Vinte E Seis

Vou subir a Penha a pé
Pra fazer minha oração

Mas dê bênção padroeira

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Usted el hombre que no tiene amor
Y por las noches pasa mucho frío
Duerme a solas en su habitación
Cuatro paredes y un techo vacío

Y por eso yo le recomiendo
Que se tire temprano a la calle
Y que busque a una mujer que lo ame
Para que en las noches
Lo abrace a su calle

Y por eso yo le recomiendo
Que se tire temprano al camino
Porque un hombre que no tiene amor
Es un ave errante y es un peregrino
Porque un hombre que no tiene amor
Es un globo que flota perdido
Que por fuera te causa esplendor
Pero por dentro siempre esta vacío

Sin un amor todo esta desierto
Sin un amor todo esta vacío
Si no le pones calor a tu invierno
El corazón enfermo se muere de frío;

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Tantas veces
Recorriste tantas veces
Mi cuerpo con tus manos

Tantas veces
Recorriste tantas veces
Mi cara con tus labios

Tantas horas
Estuvimos tantas horas
Confundidos y abrazados
Que al llegar la hora de irme me pase

Toda la noche oliendo a ti
Oliendo la almohada, oliendo a ti
Sintiendo tu boca recorrer
Mi cuerpo oliendo a ti

Dando mil vueltas pa' dormir
Y allí entre mis sueños te encontré
Y cuando de día desperté
Seguía oliendo a ti

Tantas veces
Paseaste tantas veces
Tus labios en mi cuello

Tantas veces
Descansaste tantas veces
Recostándote en mi pecho

Tantas horas
Nos pasaron tantas horas
De dejarnos sin aliento
Que al llegar la hora de irme me pase

Toda la noche oliendo a ti
Oliendo la almohada, oliendo a ti
Sintiendo tu boca recorrer
Mi cuerpo oliendo a ti

Dando mil vueltas pa' dormir
Y allí entre mis sueños te encontré
Y cuando de día desperté
Seguía oliendo a ti",Toda La Noche Oliendo a Ti

y como poder decirte que tu eres 

Mas que el día mas que el agua mas 
que la piel mas que los huesos mas 
que las piedras que la hierba mas 
mas que algo mas que todo mas 
que el suelo que el tejado mas

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Pido la paz para esta guerra
Quisiera devolver mis armas
Parar con esta hostilidad
Que no conduce a nada
Te propongo una tregua

Hago un llamado a tu conciencia
La mía ya me está matando
Quien te esta hablando se rindió
Perdió todas sus fuerzas
Y hoy viene a suplicarte
Y a pedir perdón

Hay perdóname, perdóname
No me hagas llorar
No se cómo hablar
Hay perdóname, perdóname
Que tengo que hacer
Si quieres me rindo a tus pies

Quiero que sepas que he cambiado
Que estar sin ti ha sido amargo
Por que me tuve que perder
Y andar en malos pasos
Y hoy que vuelvo a encontrarte
Quisiera volver

Hay perdóname, perdóname
No me hagas llorar
No se cómo hablar
Hay perdóname, perdóname
Que tengo que hacer
Si quieres me rindo

Perdóname, perdóname

Pido la paz para esta guerra
Amor perdóname
Por que estaba equivocado
Y ahora regreso vencido
Arrepentido y enamorado
Pido la paz para esta guerra
Amor perdóname
Por que ya no aguanto mas por eso vuelvo 
Buscando la paz suplicando, perdón
Pido la paz para esta guerra
Amor perdóname
Sin rencores, sin reproches,
Sin culpables ni inocentes, comencemos otra vez

Pido la paz para esta guerra
Amor perdóname
Te estoy pidiendo una tregua
Mi corazón se rindió de luchar contra ese amor
Pido la paz para esta guerra
Amor perdóname
Por que tuve que perder
Y tuve que sufrir y tuve que sentir
Lo que es vivir en guerra solo con el corazón

Perdóname que no puedo vivir si no estas aquí
Me hace falta tu presencia
Para mí tu eres la esencia 
Que da sabor a mi existir
Un poco más y a lo mejor nos comprendemos luego
Vuelve a mí yo te lo ruego y perdóname, perdóname
Si acaso te ofendí perdón
Si acaso te fallé perdón 
Pero ya no aguanto esta situación
Esta que me tiene triste porque 
Desde que te fuiste la felicidad no existe para mí
Para mí la vida es nada

Siento que el mundo se acaba
Poquito a poco, poco a poquito 
Regresa pronto que te necesito
Me estoy muriendo sin verte
Mira para mi seria la muerte 
Que no estés al lado mio
Yo me estoy muriendo de frio
Porque ya no puedo verte
Quiéreme como te quiero
Quiéreme es mi desvelo

La preocupación que tu no estás conmigo
No es broma lo que te digo
No, no te creas que esto es broma
Tu eres la única persona
ÓYeme que a mi me hace sentir así
El hombre mas feliz del mundo
El sentimiento profundo

El que me obliga a cantarte
A llorarte, a rogarte, a implorarte
A decirte que no me dejes morirme
Me duele la soledad y si tú te vas 
Para mi la vida es nada
Siento que el mundo se acaba
De una mañana a la otra
Esas lágrimas son pocas 
Para yo llorar por ti
Y como cuenta me di
De que me iba a morir, por eso ya estoy aquí
ÓYeme por eso ya regrese
Otra vez para pedir de una vez
Perdón, y de todo corazón yo vine a decirte así

Son cosas del corazón, el destino así lo quiso
Es mucho mas fácil pedirte perdón que haberte pedido permiso
Pero no importa la vida es corta regresa pronto se acaba el tiempo
Oye como va mi ruego te vine a pedir muchacha 
Oye como va mi ruego te vine a pedir muchacha
Que no me dejes tan triste como estoy ahora
Mira que me muero a solas y tu eres la única persona

Que a mi me comprende, y mi corazón no entiende
Que no estés al lado mio
Quiéreme y tu veras como todo será diferente
Delante de tanta gente yo vine a pedir de rodillas aunque no es cosa sencilla esto
Esto de pedir perdón, te hablo de corazón, de corazón te estoy hablando
Oye lo que estoy cantando, yo te estoy hablando en serio
Vuelve y regálame el privilegio de contar con tu cariño
Estoy llorando como un niño al que le falta un juguete nuevo
Estoy de vuelta porque te quiero, porque te quiero
Me quiero quedar por eso tu amor yo vine a buscar esta noche
Por favor y de noche yo vine a pedir casi casi 
De rodillas que me trates un poquito mejor
Y esta noche al Carneguijon vine a pedir perdón",Perdoname [Album Version] [Version]

El alma why la conciencia, tambien el corazon
Con toda mi paciencia, le fui dando la vuelta
Why ella sin darse cuenta tambien se enamoro

Como un gorrion perdido, fui buscando su abrigo
Why la tuve tan cerca que oi su corazon
Latia como el mio, why era tanta su fuerza
Que mientras la abrazaba se desbordo su amor

Cosas nuevas, mi vida se lleno de cosas nuevas
Senti la sensacion del que eleva why toca su estrella
Cosas nuevas, momentos que te dejan una huella
Si pude descubrir que hay cosas bellas lo hize por ella

Como un gorrion perdido, fui buscando su abrigo
Why la tuve tan cerca que oi su corazon
Latia como el mio, why era tanta su fuerza
Que mientras la abrazaba se desbordo su amor

Cosas nuevas, mi vida se lleno de cosas nuevas
Senti la sensacion del que eleva why toca su estrella
Cosas nuevas, momentos que te dejan una huella
Si pude descubrir que hay cosas bellas lo hize por ella

Llegue buscando su amor why me llene cosas nuevas
Descubri el cielo en sus brazos why el amor
Me salio al paso cuando la conoci
Llegue buscando su amor why me llene cosas nuevas

Que me habia enamorado comprendi
Me disipo las dudas why me lleno de ternura
Llegue buscando su amor why me llene cosas nuevas
Trabajo me costo pero me enamore
Que cosa que tambien ella se enamoro

Llegue buscando su amor why me llene cosas nuevas
Se que la felicidad es cierta pero que desde
Que la tengo cerca cosa nueva para mi
Llegue buscando su amor why me llene cosas nuevas

La vuelta why de cosas nuevas me llene

Ah lalala laralalalala ah lalalala

Aunque yo viva soñando un manantial
Para regar tu sonrisa forestal
Al menos debes dejarme sostener
La estrella pura que da mi atardecer;
Si la marea te lleva a naufragar
Aquí estoy yo con mi vela a medio alzar
Si la resaca te calla en arenal
No dudes yo te pueda desenterrar

Ah lalala laralalalala ah lalalala

Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Aunque yo viva cultivando esa ilusión 
Tú no tienes que corresponderme
Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Y no lo obligues y no te esfuerces 
¿por qué? porque no es una obligación 
Y no lo es

Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Pero si decides darme amor mejor

Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Si la marea cambia tu curso 
Yo con mucho gusto seré el faro que te guía
Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Para llevarte a puerto seguro 
Y sembrarte de mi alegría
Yo seguiré sembrando para ti 
Tú no tienes que obligarte a darme amor
Tú no te obligues a quererme 
Pero a quedarte si te convenzo yo",Sembrando Para Tí
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Limpieza de las penas,
Descorcha los sentidos,
Tu amor es vino tinto
Vino tinto

Estabas todo el tiempo
Mas yo no te veía
Sino como una amiga más
Con quien me divertía

Mis tristezas y sueños
A veces compartías,
Tus frutos tan callados
Yo no los presentía

Cuando te descubrí
Abriste nuevas brechas
Tenía el alma herida
Y la ilusión estrecha

La viña de tu vida
Estaba ya madura,
Y me diste a beber
De tu cosecha

Tu amor es vino tinto
Que aturde la cordura,
Me invade posesivo
Me embriaga de ternura
Viñedo del instinto
Limpieza de las penas,
Descorcha los sentidos,
Tu amor es vino tinto
Vino tinto

Hoy tíñeme de rojo,
Derrámate en mi copa,
Eres dueña de mi mesa
Y mi bodega

Estoy ebrio de ti
Como me riegas
Y mi sangre se añeja
Con tu sepa

Que me aturde la cordura
Y me despierta el instinto
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Me abre la ventana del sentimiento
Y me hace sentir como si flotara
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Que de un solo sorbo confunde
Me aturde pero me encanta

(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Búscame tu amor y asome con vino
Igualito al vino tinto, tu amor es así
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Descorcha los sentidos,
Me hace sentir distinto,
Suelta la rienda mi alma
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)

Tú, vino de buena cepa
En mi copa te derramas
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Que no hay mejor licor para el amor que el vino
Que no hay mejor momento que el estar contigo
(Es tu amor igual al vino tinto, es dulce, embriaga)
Me embriagas de ternura, con tu cariño",Vono Tinto

Cuando el mar se ve, ya sin su color
En la oscuridad, donde nadie va

Voy hacer que en un solo suspiro me entregues la vida
Para adorarte y con fiebre en lo labios
Saciarte de besos

Y ese atardecer
En la oscuridad
Tú serás mía

Un atardecer, en el mes de abril
Cuando los capullos se quieran abrir
Prenderé tu cuerpo
Con mi fuego ardiente
Y aún que tus pupilas ya no puedan verme
Como un sueño será cuando sientas
Que ya estás rendida

Que te fuiste ella entro a mi vida, 
No te mintieron llego a la casa 
Justo en el  momento de tu despedida 

No la esperaba sin pregunta abrió la puerta  
Y entro en mi alma se aprovecho de mi tristeza, 
De mi nostagia  y hoy me acompaña, 

Si te dijeron que esta conmigo 
A cada instante a todas hora 
No te mintieron pues como sombra 
Me persigue no me deja a solas 

Te conocía sabia todo fuiste tú
Quien le contaste y al verme solo 
No dudo en aprovecharse vino a buscarme
Y se sienta en la mesa y me acompaña en el café 
Y contempla en silencio tu retrato en la pared 

Luego pregunta por ti si te deje de pensar 
Y me sigue y me lleva hasta el cuarto 
Y me dice que  tengo que olvidar 
Y se mete en la cama y siento su respiración 
Que recorre mi cuerpo siento que me hace el amor 
Luego la veo sonreír creo que se burla de mi 
Y se acerca y me dice al oído que me olvide de ti

Que pedí hoy comprendo que nunca lo tuve
Y ni puedo decir, lo perdí mio, solo mi pena

De tener encanto para mí
Ya no es posible imaginar
Que pudo haber antes que tú
En mi existir

Supe lo que era el amor
El mismo instante que sonó tu risa junto a mí
Definitiva sensación, fue descubrir
En tu mirar, un nuevo sol

Vivo idolatradamente
Y en un monólogo interior, desesperándome
Mientras la luz de nuestras vidas va apagándose
Vidas que el destino sentenció

Hoy, que no te tengo aquí
Estoy creyendo como nunca
Había creído en ti
Y en el abismo inconsolable
De mis noches sin quietud

A conversar serenamente
Echemos un vistazo desde aquí
A todo aquello que pudimos rescatar
Hagamos un balance del pasado
Como socios arruinados
Sin rencor
Hablemos sin culparnos a los dos
Porque al final salvamos lo mejor

Ha pasado solo un año
Y el adiós abrió su herida;
Un año nada mas,
Un año gris
Que en nuestro amor duro una vida
Lentamente fue creciendo
La visión de la caída
La sombra del ayer
Nos envolvió
Y no atinamos a luchar

No ves!
Estoy gritando sin querer
Porque no puedo contener,
Esta amargura que me ahoga
Perdona, no lo puedo remediar

Bájate tú de esa nube, y ven a la realidad, 
No seas tan agrio mi socio, y así tu vida cambiaras

Y lo que no le gusta te lo dice en la cara, de frente?

Por la calle caminamos juntos

Si hubiera seguido con mi vida aquella
Me hubiera perdido el estar? con ella

Ilusiones que se encierran en los corazones
Creando emociones que son bendiciones
El milagro que aniquilan los fantasmas del pasado

Sumergida aquí en mi vida en ella te colaste
Como una bandida y yo soy tu guarida

Hay que ser idiota para no adivinar
Que cualquier otra escogencia no habría estado mal
Pero nada comparado a ella
Y pensar por un minuto la vida sin ella?

Hay que ser idiota para no entender
Que ella es todo lo que busco en una mujer?
Y al mirarme ella me tiene entre sus manos
Y es por eso que la amo

Hay que ser idiota para no entender
Que ella es todo lo que busco?

Ella es así? me canso?
Me canso

Me canso?

Me llena de calma y me quieta la inquietud

Ella es ahora mi rallito de luz?

Y me arrebata su virtud

Ella es ahora mi rallito de luz? en la sombra?

Cuando le veo los ojitos?
Con sus dos luceritos

Encima mira bonito?

Como un animal furtivo
Me persigue por toda esta soledad
Cuando creo que por fin
Ya la he olvidado para siempre
Aparece de la nada su mirada
Y yo no soy nadie

Que alguien me diga
Como se olvida
Como se arranca para siempre

Que alguien me ayude
Se me hace urgente
Ando buscando entre la gente

En la puerta de una esquina vuelvo a tropezar
Con la cara de un pasado que yo había olvidado

Hola que tal
Tu perdóname si al verte
Se me olvida hablar
Hay heridas que en el tiempo cicatrizan mal
Y uno quiere hacerse el fuerte
Achacárselo a la suerte

Pero duele tu no sabes como duele
Como si tuvieras tú mil alfileres
Y no puedas enterrarlo poco a poco
En un corazón ya roto

Hola que tal
Ese nuevo amor espero no te pague mal
Que el espacio de tus días logre al fin llegar
Y no tenga un final triste la confianza que le diste

Porque duele tu no sabes como duele
Como si tuvieras tú mil alfileres
Y no puedas enterrarlo poco a poco
En un corazón ya roto

Eso ay tú no sabes como duele
Tú no sabes como duele Tú no sabes como hiere
Eso ay tú no sabes como duele
Ay como duele y molesta un desamor
Como duele querer a quien no te quiere
Eso ay tú no sabes como duele

Lleva really Los recuerdos de ti 
Lo que me hiciste sufrir también fuiste mi vida
Soy alguien que te rescata dime ni que por ley 
Del amor fuiste mi vida
Y como duele

Dime tu mamita como duele
Porque lo del pasado Que he sufrido cuando vuelves
Que suele la vida dejando corre y corre
Y ya algunos dolores cuando son del alma nunca mueren
Cuando uno quiere y no lo quiere
Y cuando uno

De su vida y Sin piedad no lo tiene
Espero que todo el Amor sea contigo como Lo hiciste conmigo
Hace tiempo que no te veía
Que no habías Los años todavía
Fue casualidad nena haberme tropezado
De todas formas rosa para ti ya te he olvidado
Uh

Camínalo

Eso ay tú no sabes como duele
Tú no sabes lo que duele ni siquiera te imaginas
Lo que da la vida porque no te conviene
Eso ay tú no sabes como duele
Ojala no te pase a ti porque así 
Vas a sentir ay como duele",...Y Eso Duele
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Amándote como lo voy a  negar
Si se me puede notar
En cada palabra que digo
En cada beso  suspiro
Que alguna noche de olvido
Extravíe por esos rumbos

Buscándote como lo voy a negar
No hay camino ni lugar
Que no haya recorrido yo
En mi afán de seguir extrañándote
Como se extraña el amor
Con lagrimas en la voz

En cada latido del cuerpo
Sigue mi mente nombrándote
De tanto pensar y pensar
Dejo dormir sin soñar
Se multiplican las letras de tu nombre
Tu me quieres borrar de tu historia

Yo me niego a partir
Tu me quieres olvidar
Pero yo voy a seguir amándote
Me duelen las manos de tanto morderlas,
Amándote me duele la vida de tanto rodar
Por ahí, nesecitándote y amándote

Los días se pasan las noches se inventan amándote
Me busco las horas sacando la cuenta
Y solo me queda el vacío de vivir sin ti
Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy a negar
Como negar que estoy enamorado
Y quiero volver a empezar

Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy anegar
No he encontrado quien me quiera como tu
Por eso es que por tus besos no me canso de esperar
Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy a negar
Con lagrimas en la voz con lastima de mí mismo
No hago mas que recordar

Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy a negar
Como he de negar que sigo amándote
Si sigo soñándote buscándote en cualquier lugar
Como se extraña el amor vivo extrañándote
Como se busca la felicidad sigo buscándote
Y aveces me parece estar ecuchándote

Mi mente es la que sigue inventándote
Y paso las noches llorándote, llamándote
Oye los latidos de mi corazón herido
Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy a negar
Tu que me quieres sacar de tu historia
Yo que me niego y no quiero marchar

Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy a negar
No hay camino ni lugar que yo no haya recorrido
Perdido en mi loco afán
Y yo sigo amándote como lo voy anegar
Amándote, llorándote, soñándote
Buscándote en mi soledad

Paso la vida soñando paso la vida pensando
Como lo voy a negar, no puedo vivir negando que ese sueño
Que tú eres no lo puedo sujetar,
Como lo voy a negar
Te me vas como agua entre las manos te me vas
Como lo voy a negar, que vivo así
Amándote como lo voy a negar",Amándote

Paso a pasito, poquito a poquito, así crece mi cariño cuando estoy enamorao
Yo no lo quiero prestao, ni dao, quiero habérmelo ganao
Que si el cariño no es de veras, si el cariño no es genuino,
Siempre termino desilusionao
Yo no lo quiero prestao, ni dao, quiero habérmelo ganao
Porque no se puede, y no, que no se puede cosechar lo que nunca se ha sembrado
Yo no lo quiero prestao, ni dao, quiero habérmelo ganao

Que yo no quiero, no quiero ni mirar pal lao
Yo no lo quiero prestao, ni dao, quiero habérmelo ganao

Regalao no lo quiero, regalao no me gusta
Cariño, cariño, cariño que se rinde rápidamente te juro que a mi me asusta
Regalao no lo quiero, regalao no me gusta
Porque como viene se va, porque como viene se va, 
Y empiezan los llantos y empiezan las dudas
Regalao no lo quiero, regalao no me gusta
Ay, amor de mentira, amor de la boca para afuera ya no está de moda, eso no se usa
Regalao no lo quiero, regalao no me gusta
Porque más me gusta el cariño que uno pelea y lo busca

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Muchas veces te dije que antes de hacerlo había que pensarlo muy bien 
Que esta unión de nosotros le hacia falta carne y deseo también 
Que no bastaba que me entendieras y que murieras por mi 
Que no bastaba que en mis fracasos yo me refugiara en ti 
Y ahora ya vez lo que ahora paso al fin nació al pasar de los años 
El tremendo cansancio que provoco yo en ti 
Y aunque es penoso lo tienes que decir 

Por mi parte esperaba que un día el tiempo se hiciera cargo del fin 
si asi no hubiera sido yo habría seguido jugando hacerte feliz 
y aunque el llanto es amargo piensa en los años que tienes para vivir 
que mi dolor no es menos y lo peor es que ya no puedo sentir 
y ahora tratar de conquistar con vano afán ese tiempo perdido 
Que nos deja vencidos sin poder conocer 

Eso que llaman amor para vivir (para vivir)

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Un corazón olvidado
Vacío y en soledad
Un barco en la arena atrapado
Después de la tempestad
Es todo lo que me queda de tu amistad

Tu voz amante ganó mi risa

Y crucé sin miedo
Yo tan de cerca te seguía
Que no leí donde decía

Ni tu frío en mi calor

Y yo sigo aquí deseando verte
Me atraviesa el alma tu recuerdo
Es como una espada que duele
El deseo de amarte se aparece
Es como la hiedra que no sede
Se va apoderando de mi cuerpo
Casí hasta dejarlo sin aliento
Siempre acabo igual
Flotando en tu recuerdo
Esperando el milagro
Que te haga regresar
Siempre acabo igual
Muriéndome de pena
Cortándome las venas
Celándote de mas
Siempre acabo igual
En medio de mi cuarto
Mirando tu retrato
Tirado en el sofá

Mis amigos dicen que te olvide
Y yo les prometo voy a hacerlo
Pero al verme solo sin tus besos
Las promesas se las lleva el viento
Siempre acabo igual
Flotando en tu recuerdo
Esperando el milagro
Que te haga regresar
Siempre acabo igual
Muriéndome de pena
Cortándome  las venas
Celándote de mas
Siempre acabo igual

Siempre acabo de la misma manera
Llorando por ti
Dando vueltas la noche entera
Sufriendo por que te perdí
Siempre acabo de la misma manera
Llorando por ti
Llorando por ti sufriendo por ti
Es tu recuerdo que llega duele y no se quiere ir

Siempre acabo de la misma manera
Llorando por ti
Pero por que negar que siempre acabo igual
Por que negar que siempre acabo así
Siempre acabo igual
Dando vueltas en la cama y con ganas de llorar
Siempre acabo así
Y tu recuerdo me persigue me atormenta y no me deja vivir
Siempre acabo igual
Hola soledad hace tiempo te esperaba
Siempre acabo así
Y aunque ya no quede nada aunque tu amor lo perdí
Siempre acabo igual

Siempre acabo así

Mas nunca volveré a caer
En esas trampas que el amor cuando quiere sorprendernos
Nos suele tender

Yo que cuide tanto mis pasos
Para no envolverme nunca en caprichos de amores

Y caigo rendido a tus pies

Yo no quería conocerte, no
Imaginaba que iba a ser así
Todo pasó tan de repente, sentí un impulso tan urgente
De ir a entregarte lo mejor de mi

Yo no quería conocerte, no
Pero en el juego de tu amor me perdí
Yo no quería conocerte, no
Y ya no se vivir sin ti

Que solía criticar
Y aquel rojo lápiz de labios que
Odiaba el día empezar

Será que me haces tanta falta

Añoro tus malos humores
Tus tardanzas al salir
Todas tus noches de ausencia
Que pasaba sin dormir

Por que será
Que todo hoy es especial
Será que me haces tanta falta

Desde que no estas
Vivir es solo caminar
En el vacío
Como barca sin destino
Sin un puerto al que llegar
Desde que tu no estas aquí

El potro va tiempo al tiempo porque le sobra la edad, 
caballo viejo no puede perder la flor que le dan, 
porque después de esta vida no hay otra oportunidad 

El caballo no quiere perder el tiempo

Cuando el amor llega así, llega así,

Cuando el amor llega así, llega así,

Caballo le dan sabana 
Porque esta viejo y cansao

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Como dos delfines jugando en las olas, siguiendo los barcos, así siempre estamos,
Como dos palomas que se ven a solas, en un campanario, así nos amamos,
Parece que fue ayer que nos unimos, pero es amor de tiempo y sigue vivo
Estamos amarrados hasta el fin

Si tu saltas yo salto, si tu vuelas yo trato
Si tu estas a mi lado no me importa nada mas
Si caminas yo ando, si tu ganas yo gano
Si tu sientes tristeza, yo también me siento igual
Somos almas gemelas

Como dos palmeras que han crecido juntas, solas en el campo así siempre estamos
Como dos estrellas que parecen una, en un cielo claro, así nos amamos
Parece que fue ayer que nos unimos, pero es amor de tiempo y sigue vivo
Estamos amarrados hasta el fin

Si tu saltas yo salto, si tu vuelas yo trato
Si tu estas a mi lado no me importa nada mas
Si caminas yo ando, si tu ganas yo gano
Si tu sientes tristeza, yo también me siento igual
Somos almas gemelas

Tu para mi, mi complemento para ser feliz, yo para ti, yo he nacido para ti
Tal para cual, no hay nada mas que buscar, sin discusión así somos, almas gemelas
Tu para mi, hecha a la medida, yo para ti, por el resto de mi vida, tal para cual
Somos el uno del otro en alegrías y penas, almas gemelas

Tu para mi, nuestras almas que se entienden, yo para ti, sin duda a la perfección, tal para cual
Somos uno solo en un solo corazón, almas gemelas
Tu para mi, nuestros destinos unidos, yo para ti, sentimientos idénticos, tal para cual
Y ese sentido de amor que nos salva y nos renueva

Tu para mi, como dos gotas de agua, yo para ti, como dos granos de arena, tal para cual
Como dos palomas, dos palmeras, almas gemelas
Tu para mi, tal parece que fue ayer que nos unimos, yo para ti, pero es amor de tiempo y sigue vivo
Es perfecto este amor, tu conmigo yo contigo, almas gemelas

Tu para mi, yo sigo por tu camino, yo para ti, tu caminas por mis huellas, tal para cual
Si estas feliz yo me rio, y lloro tu pena, almas gemelas",Almas Gemelas
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Si tu no me miras, no te mirare

Yo nunca he podido
de ningún modo olvidarte
y trato de sacarte
de mi corazón herido
mi obsesión contigo
se que debe terminar
por eso lo voy a intentar
de esta manera que digo

Intento pagarte
con la misma moneda

tras de ti un corazón
que busca en vano consolación
hasta que pueda borrarte",Ni Te Llamo Ni Te Busco

Que alguien me diga, como se olvida
Ese alguien que me quiera me comprenda 
Que me entienda y ponga luz a mi vida
Que alguien me diga, como se olvida
Como borrar ese nombre de mi pasado
Para que no me persiga
Que alguien me diga, como se olvida

Que alguien me diga
Como se arranca una pena de toditita una vida
Que alguien me diga
Como se sana un dolor como se borra una herida
Que alguien me diga

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Te enviare un ramo de besos que hice con mi corazón
Y en el cielo dormiremos entre nubes de algodón
Gritare a los cuatro vientos
Que eres tu la ilusión que llevaba dentro
Y veras como es posible nuestro amor

Si los hombres han llegado hasta la luna
Si desde Sevilla, puedo hablar con alguien
Que esta en Nueva York
Si la medicina cura
Lo que antes era una muerte segura
Dime porque no es posible nuestro amor

Si la bella con un beso convirtió a la bestia en un galán
Si las flores se marchitan y mas tarde vuelven a brotar
Si hay abuelos que se quieren
Y su amor es todo lo que tienen
Dime por que no lo vamos a intentar

Te enviare un ramo de besos que hice con mi corazón
Y en el cielo dormiremos entre nubes de algodón
Gritare a los cuatro vientos
Que eres tu la ilusión que llevaba dentro
Y veras como es posible nuestro amor

Si hay poemas que se escriben con el alma
Y miradas que se empañan cuando suena una canción
Si los ojos son sinceros, cuando alguien te mira
Y se escapa un te quiero
Dime por que no es posible nuestro amor

Si en la caracola se oyen los rumores de la mar
Si la gente ya se encienden y después se vuelven a apagar
Si amanece cada día, si hay momentos
Que valen toda una vida
Dime por que no lo vamos a intentar

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Si no me ven llorando

Si no me ven llorando

Si no me ven llorando fue porque ya
Me olvide,sino me ven llorando fue
Porque ya me libere de aquel amor
Que nunca me supo entender
Tarde o temprano yo sabia que
Me iba a suceder

Me he dado cuenta que la vida tiene
Otro sentir,y si un amor se va,
Hay que saber vivir que lo importante
Es levantarse y poder continuar
Un amor llega siempre cuando el
Otro va saliendo

Quieres lograr

Y para poder conseguirlo tienes
Que tratar en este ritmo que
Es muy fácil te quiero decir
Es un reto para ti, lo tienes que
Tratar

Tu forma de sentir y si lo
Cantas gozaras de felicidad

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Que me digas que ahora el amor sabe mal
Que me digas que el sol va dejar de alumbrar
Es querer renunciar 
A los sueños de ayer
Es mirar la montaña y decir,no podre
Superar esta prueba
Que puede matar
Cuando estas justo ahí
De poderla alcanzar

Yo si creo que mal
Nos podría caer
Olvidarnos que aun este amor puede ser

Mentira
Que el amor se nos fue de la piel
Es mentira
Que los besos no saben a miel
Es mentira
Que que mi cuerpo te enfría
Que la magia termina
Me sabe a mentira

Mentira
Que lo bueno algún día se acaba
Es mentira
Que el adiós es volver a nacer 
Es mentira
Que tus ojos se olvidan
Que la fe es como un barco
Tirado en la orilla 
Juro que es, mentira

Que me digas que ahora es cuestión de olvidar
Y que por una vez lo podemos pensar
Es querer renunciar 
A los sueños de ayer

Es abrir en el alma una herida sin fin
Es caer a un abismo
Mirarte partir es nadar contra el mar
Esta vida sin ti

Yo si creo que mal
Nos podría caer
Olvidarnos que aun este amor puede ser

que tu amor no esta a mi alcance
que haré mucho que perdí
Ríen cuando digo convencido
que vas a volver conmigo
y que voy a ser feliz

Juran que ya rayo en la locura 
y es que me han visto por ahí hablando solo

Pueden decir lo que quieran de mi amor por ti
encerrarme para siempre entre cuatro paredes y un techo
Pueden jurar que en tu nueva vida no hay lugar
para el hombre que te supo dar los momentos mas bellos
Pueden hacer lo que quieran con mi corazón
arrancarlo de mi pecho y no, nunca voy a negarte
Pueden pasar cuatro siglos y una eternidad 
y yo seguiré en mi soledad cada día esperándote
Pueden hacer lo que quieran conmigo

que estoy medio loco, que he perdido la razón

Se puede Se puede

No te digo que es fácil no te voy a engañar
Se pasan largas horas de inmensa soledad
La vida se te escapa sin poderlo evitar
Y sientes que tu pena no termina jamás

Cuando sientas deseos de volver a llamar
Tu veras que se puede

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Si no lo digo ahora
Reviento, no paso otro minuto sin hablar
Si no descargo lo que llevo dentro
Tal vez otra ocacion no volvera

Tengo el pecho apretado de ansiedad
Tengo las manos frias
Tengo que hablarte amiga
Me tienes q escuchar
Contigo mi rutina se alteró
Why me fuiste robando el corazón

Si no fueras mi amiga
Para mi seria mejor
No sabes cuantas veces te besé
No sabes que me amaste tu también
Si nunca te enteraste
Fue porque me lo soñé

No se de donde saco este valor
Para contarte
Pero no aguanto mas
No aguanto mas

Si no lo digo ahora
Reviento, no se como lo vayas a tomar
Tal vez tu lo sabias hare tiempo
O ahora es q te acabas de enterar

Tengo el pecho apretado de ansiedad
Tengo las manos frias
Tengo que hablarte amiga
Me tienes q escuchar
Contigo mi rutina se alteró
Why me fuiste robando el corazón

Si no fueras mi amiga
Para mi seria mejor
No sabes cuantas veces te besé
No sabes que me amaste tu también
Si nunca te enteraste
Fue porque me lo soñé

No se de donde saco este valor
Para contarte
Pero no aguanto mas
No aguanto mas

Te como las manos te miro a los ojos
Para confesarte ésto que yo siento
Quizas tu te acabas de enteras
Quizas lo sabias de hare tiempo

Eres mas que amiga mia
Entraste en mis sentimientos
Why quiero q seas tu
El destino de mis besos

Esperaba esta ocacion de abrirme de corazon
Why explicartelo
Why confesartelo
Why contartelo

Poquitito a poco sin planearlo
Me fuiste atrayendo
Me fuiste llevando
Me fuiste acercando a tu corazon

Me imaginaba que tu lo sabias
Pues en mi mirada un brillo habia
Why algo de amor te decia

Me fuiste atrayendo como iman
Tienes una fuerza que me hare estar cerca
Why si no lo digo voy a reventar
",Si No Lo Digo Ahora
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Entre tus ojos y los míos ardiente y fuerte
Escalofrío estoy temblando igual que haces
Tu entre tus manos y mis manos indicios de
Eventual te amo dos corazones a punto de
Estallar apunto de alcanzar el cielo estoy
A distancia de un te quiero para tocarte el
Alma con el primer beso estoy a la distancia
De un te quiero para sentir lo que
Tanto soñé sentir

Estoy a la distancia de un te quiero
Para adorarte tanto ,tanto y sin remedio
Estoy a la distancia de un te quiero
Y ya no puedo,me desespero y casi
Me muero por llegar a ti entre tus labios
Y mis labios no existiría el mundo a
Nuestro lado la luna llena brillara
Sobre los dos nos sorprendería el,
Sol amándonos estoy a la distancia",A  La Distancia de un Te Quiero
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Yo no se porque razón cantarle a ella
Si debí aborrecerla con las fuerzas de mi corazón,
Todavía no la borro totalmente
Ella siempre esta presente como ahora en esta canción

Incontable son las veces que he tratado
De borrarla y no he logrado
Arrancarla ni un segundo de mi mente,
Porque ella sabe todo mi pasado,
Me conoce demasiado y es posible que por eso se aproveche

Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas,
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme,
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha,
Unas veces me desprecia
Y otra veces lo hace para entretenerse y es así

Aun recuerdo la canción que le hice un día,
Que en el fondo no sabia que eso era malo para mi,
Poco a poco fui cayendo en un abismo,
Siempre me paso lo mismo nadie sabe lo que yo sufrí

Una victima total de sus antojos
Pero un día abrí los ojos
Y con rabia la arranque de mi memoria,
Poco a poco fui saliendo hacia delante
En los brazos de otra amante,
Pude terminar al fin con esta historia

Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas,
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme,
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha,
Unas veces me desprecia
Y otra veces lo hace para entretenerse y es así Um

Yo era capaz de subir al cielo
Para bajarle un montón de estrellas

Todo fue así, así mismo fue, todo fue por ella
Yo la quería yo la adoraba cuando debía de aborrecerla
Todo fue así, así mismo fue, todo fue por ella
Oye bien yo que le entregaba el alma
Y el corazón y por esa razón jugo conmigo sin penas

Todo fue así, te digo que así mismo fue, todo fue por ella
Ya me lo habían advertido mi amigo
Pero el amor te aloca y te ciega

Y Todo fue así, como digo yo que fue, todo fue por ella
Y de ahora en adelante ya yo lo se
Y no pasare lo mismo por lo que yo pase

Míralo
Todo fue así, mi corazón le ofrecí,
Todo fue por ella pues la encontraba tan bella,
Todo fue así, se fue y no dejo una huella,
Todo fue por ella, y al abismo me caí,
Todo fue así y como siempre sigo así,
Todo fue por ella, un idiota en el amor,
Todo fue así, me destruí en el dolor,
Todo fue por ella, por ella fue que estuve así",Un Montón de Estrellas
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Pensé que estaba curado de amor
Que estaba recuperado
Que había logrado cerrar con candado
Las puertas de mi alma después de un fracaso

Pero parece que el corazón
Se me quedo un poco abierto
Y al gusto de un beso nació un sentimiento
Que ya conocía y daba por muerto

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Yo me jure no entregarme al amor
Como lo hice algún día
Jure que seria conmigo egoísta
Pero no conté con tu cara tan linda

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Y desearte como a nadie igual
Sin miedo de expresar mis sentimientos
Quiero tener conmigo siempre al despertar
El cielo en cada beso y en ti todos mis sueños

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase
No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",Un Amor Para la Historia [Bolero/Balada]

Descubro el fuego de tu arrojo y me pregunto
Por qué no te tuve siempre si es
En tus ojos donde llego nuevamente a comprender
Que puedo amar eternamente

Cómo he podido estar sin ti
Cómo se puede respirar en el vacío
Cómo se vive con el alma en el
Abismo sin el calor inagotable de tu abrigo

Cómo he podido estar sin ti
Cómo se puede navegar sin tu
Cariño si no habrá nada más
Allá de estar contigo preferiría
Naufragar en el olvido

Me robo un beso de tu boca y me perfuma el dulce
Olor de tu inocencia te has convertido en la
Razón de mi existencia nunca sabré
Cómo vivir sin tu presencia

Cómo he podido estar sin ti
Cómo se puede respirar en el vacío
Cómo se vive con el alma en el
Abismo sin el calor inagotable de tu abrigo

Cómo he podido estar sin ti
Cómo se puede navegar sin tu
Cariño si no habrá nada más
Allá de estar contigo 
Preferiría naufragar en el olvido",Como He Podido Estar en Ti [Balada]
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Pensé que estaba curado de amor
Que estaba recuperado
Que había logrado cerrar con candado
Las puertas de mi alma después de un fracaso

Pero parece que el corazón
Se me quedo un poco abierto
Y al gusto de un beso nació un sentimiento
Que ya conocía y daba por muerto

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Yo me jure no entregarme al amor
Como lo hice algún día
Jure que seria conmigo egoísta
Pero no conté con tu cara tan linda

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Y desearte como a nadie igual
Sin miedo de expresar mis sentimientos
Quiero tener conmigo siempre al despertar
El cielo en cada beso y en ti todos mis sueños

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase
No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Tú, con la inocencia conquistaste
De mi vida cada parte,
Contigo volví a nacer
Yo, te regalaba cada ansia,
Y tejía en la distancia el momento de volver

Todo fue cayendo en el vacío
Y sentí que el amor mío
De tus manos se escapó
Y se fue volviendo pesadilla
Todo aquello que algún día
Le dio vida al corazón

Será que tú te enamoraste de otras manos,
Será que el viento ya no sopla a mi favor
Será que todo lo que era fantasía
Se te ha olvidado cuando hacemos el amor

Será que yo de la costumbre de tenerte
Deje pasar las emociones, la pasión
Será que nada volverá a ser como antes
Por qué dejamos escapar tanta ilusión?",Sera [Balada]
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Vaya Colombia, esto es pa' ti 
Me he es difícil mirarte, tan segura te vez
Y no imaginas que busco tu perdón
Por buscar calor, sin valor de confesar bien sabes, 
Cobijado en otro amor
Me he es difícil odiarte o imponerte un adiós 
Que te haga enjuiciarme con desmán
Necesito tu amistad, tus consejos, tu emoción, 
Pero se también que quiero un poco más
 
No me mires a los ojos que las fuerzas se me escapan
Tus pupilas se dilatan y no puedo alzar mi voz
No, no me mires a los ojos que disuades mis sentidos de explicarte 
Que he escondido mis verdades con razón

Ay mama 

Si tú mirada matara, ahora estaría en el cielo hay que miedo, 
Si tú mirada matara
Si tú mirada me mata, me arrebata

No me mires a los ojos que yo te espero solamente a ti

Acércate un poquito que te quiero para mi
Oye no me mires así, que me vuelvo loco
No me mires, hay mami no me mires
Anoche aprendí y no quiero andar por ahí
Necesito que me hables

No me mates con los celos traicioneros

Con ráfagas de besos y de pasión
Fue tan fuerte el impacto me estremeció
No estaba preparado mi corazón para seducción

Sólo quedan los recuerdos de destrucción
Y aunque parezca absurda la conclusión
Quisiera que sobrara mi corazón en otra ocasión

Oye no fue un huracán ni un ciclón tampoco me volvió loco y me devastó
(Lo que arrasó lo que arrasó)
Pasó a 100 millas por hora esa tormenta de amor

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Lo que me inspira a hacer esta canción
Es una sensación que yo no imaginaba
Que como un rayo penetra en mi interior
La fuerza de un amor que me atraviesa el alma

Una pasión que llega al corazón
Enamorándolo como yo no esperaba
Y creo que se despertó otra vez el rincón de mis ansias

Apareció de pronto una mujer
Dulce como la miel suave como la espuma
Que con un beso lleno de pasión
Revivió la ilusión donde no había ninguna
No pude más y en el momento aquél
Me pelizqué la piel para ver si soñaba
Y era verdad estaba frente a mí mientras que la besaba

Le pregunté al corazón y él me contestó que está loco por ella
Y yo que no puedo aguantar ni un momento no más el deseo de verla
Ya se me metió en la piel y esa linda mujer desde la noche aquélla
No pude más y en el momento aquél me pellizqué 
La piel para ver si soñaba
Y era verdad estaba frente a mí mientras que me besaba

(Mi corazón hace tilín tilín hace tilín tilán)
Tan pronto digo su nombre mi corazón me responde y enseguida cede sí
(Mi corazón hace tilín tilín hace tilín tilán)
Si de su carita me acuerdo ya rapidito pierdo la calma en el lado izquierdo
(Mi corazón hace tilín tilín hace tilín tilán)
Tilín tilín tilín tilín esto es un amor sin fin
Tilín tilán mis pensamientos con ella se van

Cada vez que llega un nuevo amanecer
Me levanto triste sin saber por que
Siento una agonia que me da alegria
Why dolor depuees

Si al menos supiera que fuera que fuera por ti
O fuera por alguien que me haga sentir
Este sentimiento why ese amor inmenso
Que antes no vivi

Esa sombra loca que llegua a mi cama
Siento que me toca, siento que me llama
Why al tratar de verla, se pierde en la puerta
Why no aparece maas

Pienso en tus caricias, pienso en tu mirada
Why ese amor inmenso que antes tu me dabas
Why me siento alegre por tener tu cuerpo
Pero ya no estaaas

Laralaralala, laralalara, laralalaraaa

Ando por las calles como un loco mas
Buscando un detalle para recordar
Para hablar con alguien
Why esperar que pase otro dia igual

Al volver a casa why al pensar en ti
No se que me pasa que vuelvo a sufrir
Why no tengo duda que esa cara tuya
Me hare muuy feliz

Esa sombra loca que llegua a mi cama
Siento que me toca, siento que me llama
Why al tratar de verla, se pierde en la puerta
Why no aparece maas

Esa sombra loca sigue alli en la cama
Siento que me toca siento que me llama
Why al tratar de verla se pierde en la puerta

Esa sombra muerta que me quita el sueñooo

Es la misma sombra que a mi se me esconde
Tiene tu silueta, why lleva tu nombre

(Esa sombra loca que llega a mi cama)
(Siento que me toca, siento que me llama)
Why se me aparece al lado de la cama
Why desvanece, me roba la calma

(Esa sombra loca que llega a mi cama)

Siiiento que esta presente por toda la casa
Se me aparece como un fantasma

Why tus caricias tu mirada

La sombra de tu cariño, esta en todos los rincones
De esta casa, why no se puede borrar, ni olvidar

(La sombra de tu amor)

Tu me hare falta el recuerdome asalta
Mi trsiteza es tanta, why no te puedo encontraar

(La sombra de tu amor)

Todas las noches tu recuerdo me quita el sueño
Me llaga puntuaal

Tu imagen que me persigue
Why no me deja vivir en paz

Teengo miedo de volver a casa
A pasar otro dia igual

Y en tus playas el mar agita sus olas
El firmamento brinda su mejor estrella
Para darle la luz a tu preciosa arena

Por la mañana siempre sale el sol primero
Y se llena de luz el paraíso mío
Y en la verde montaña el Jibarito canta
Un “lelolay” que es signo en el mundo entero

Que inspirado en ti se murió soñando
Por tu cielo azul y tus verdes campos
Tierra del Edén, Isla del Encanto

Eres un encanto y por eso te quiero yo tanto!

Mi Puerto Rico, a ti yo te estoy cantando
Porque eres linda mi tierra,
A lo largo y a lo ancho
Desde San Juan hasta Ponce,
De Mayagüez a Fajardo
Esos cien por treinta y cinco
Tienen magia, tienen algo
Como me gustan tus playas,
Y me fascinan tus campos
Preciosa te llaman las olas del mar,
Dijo Rafael en su canto
El morro que te protege
Y el yunque te sigue adornando
En tu suelo vi la luz del cielo y en ti me sigo inspirando
Yo soy borícua de pura cepa por eso mismo te canto
Míralo!

De ahí vengo yo,
Yo soy de ahí

Yo vengo de Puerto Rico
Oigan! De la isla del Coki
Un sitio que es muy bonito
Sabroso para vivir
Los que dicen “ay bendito”, esos son de mi país

Amor de locos locura de amor
Lo tuyo y lo mio es

Si pudiera pasar junto a ti una noche completa
Por ejemplo sentados los dos a la orilla del mar
Y entregarnos con loca pasíón sin que nadie lo sepa
Que no pueda haber mas testigos que la oscuridad
Para darnos besito a besito el amor que nos quepa
Como locos perdidos en la noche hasta que salga el sol
Contemplar el amanecer con el alma repleta
Si pudiéramos tener esa noche solitos los dos

Seria vivir lo lindo y lo bello
Seria sentir lo dulce de un beso
Seriacomo alcanzar el cielo
Seria alimentar lo nuestro

Y así eternamente feliz
Tu para mi y yo para ti en el mas dulce momento

Seria vivir lo lindo y lo bello
Seria sentir lo dulce de un beso
Seria como alcanzar el cielo
Seria alimentar lo nuestro

Corazón, 
Como pudo pasarme esto a mi
Yo que tanto cuide tu debilidad
Yo que tanto esquive tu trampa mortal
Mírame, nada mas
En la cosa que me convertí
Yo que tenia el control de mis asuntos
Yo solo de mirarla quedo mudo

Y es la primera vez
Que me acorrala un cuerpo de mujer
Yo nunca pude ver, como llegaba hasta mi piel
Y no comprendo por que 
Vine a caer en esa red de su querer
Y ya ves como me encuentro bajo sus pies

Yo que vivía saboreando el triunfo
Del amor, venciendo el reto siempre certero
Como una especie de Picasso ante su lienzo
Como una letra invicto hasta el momento
Siempre atento, al sexo opuesto
Rompiendo todos los corazones y dejándolos desechos
Como un eterno casanova con su vida sola
Como una Supernova en el cielo

Y llegaste y cambiaste mi vida en una y dos
Con esas cosas raras del amor
Y estoy a la deriva en una relación, 
De sufrimiento y quisiera encontrar aquel hombre que era yo
Pero tu me acorralas con tu voz
Estoy que solo a veces hallo la razón
Pero la pierdo

La sonrisa y que mas puedo hacer yo
Si no te tengo

Cogía pa la disco y era todo un zar

Por que hoy  
No estoy para ti  
Has de cuenta que hoy  
Yo no estoy aquí
 
Pensamiento no mortifiques mas  
No estoy para ti  
 
Sabes bien que la amo sin razón  
Que a su lado me sentiría mejor  
Pensamiento no mortifiques mas  
Mejor hablemos mañana  
 
Por que hoy  
No estoy para ti  
No estoy para ti  
Has de cuenta que hoy  
Yo no estoy aquí
 
Pensamiento no mortifiques mas  
No estoy para ti  
 
Sabes que por ella muero  
Que sin sus ojos me pierdo  
Entonces dame un día para así 
Reflexionar  
No te molestes si te pido  
Un respiro nada mas  
 
Por que hoy  
No estoy para ti  
Has de cuenta que hoy  
Yo no estoy aquí
 
Déjame en paz pensamiento  
Sabes que te lo advertí  
Que hoy no voy a llorarla  
No voy a pensarla  
Voy a olvidar y a vivir  
 
Por que hoy  
Por que hoy  
No estoy para ti  
Que yo no estoy para ti  
Has de cuenta que hoy  
Yo no estoy aquí
 
Al menos el día de hoy  
Voy a reír y a borrar mi amargura  
A vivir una aventura  
A cometer una locura  
Voy a salir por ahí 
 
Aunque sea por hoy  
No voy a pensar en ella  
 
No voy a pensar en nada  
Voy a borrarme esta pena  
 
Aunque sea por hoy  
Solo por hoy  
No voy a pensar en ella  
 
Voy a olvidarme de esta pena que me lastima  
Aunque mañana vuelva a la rutina de quererla  
 
Aunque sea por hoy  
Solo por hoy  
No voy a pensar en ella  
 
Salir de estas cuatro paredes  
Quitarme las redes  
Que me amarran y que me enferman  
 
Aunque sea por hoy  
El día de hoy  
No voy a pensar en ella  
 
Solo 24 horas para no quererla  
No voy a pensar en ella  
Pensamiento no me presiones  
No me colmes la paciencia  
No voy a pensar en ella  
Voy a ver si se me quita  
Este dolor y esta urgencia  
No voy a pensar en ella  
No voy a pensarla  
No voy a llorarla  
No voy a cagarla  
 
No voy a pensar",No Estoy Para Ti
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Lyrics to No Te Vayas :
Quien fue el tonto de la idea
Quien te dijo que al amor
Hay que dejarlo ir
Para que vuelva
Te aseguro esa persona
Nunca a estado enamorado
Como yo lo estoy de ti
Ahora
Imaginate si esto
De perderte es un desastre
Que aun no te has ido why ya estoy
Con el alma hecha pedazos
Aferrandome a la vida
Entre tus brazos

No te vayas
Si tu cruzas esa puerta
Me vas a matar de pena mira
No lo hagas
Espera
Solo espera un poco mas
No te vayas
Te lo pido de rodiilas
En nombre de este amor mi vida
No lo hagas
Aguarda una vez mas

Quien fue el tonto de la idea
Quien te dijo que aun amor tu
Lo puedes cambiar
Asi por otro
Te aseguro que ese idiota
No conoce para nada la palabra amar
Como nosotros
Saca ya de tu cabeza
Esa absurda why tonta idea
Que lo nuestro a llegado a su fin
Por favor recapacita
Por dios apiadate de mi

No te vayas
Si tu cruzas esa puerta
Me vas a matar de pena mira
No lo hagas
Espera
Solo espera un poco mas
No te vayas
Te lo pido de rodiilas
En nombre de este amor mi vida
No lo hagas
Aguarda una vez mas
Aquel pacto entre los dos
Lo que tanto nos costo
Si cruzas esa puerta

Quien fue el tonto de la idea
Quien te dijo que al amor
Hay que dejarlo ir
Para que vuelva
",No Te Vayas
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Nos hace bien que nos quedemos hoy en casa
Solo en silencio mirándonos a la cara
Nos hace bien que nos besemos esta noche
Como sino fuera haber más

Nos hace bien que nos digamos mil te amos
Por esas veces al amor amordazamos	
Nos hace bien que nos cerremos las heridas
Y nos abramos al amor

Nos hace bien que le digamos hoy al miedo no te quiero ver jamás
Nos hace bien que construyamos un castillo
Y que seamos como niños sin tener miedo a jugar
Nos hace bien que nos salgamos de esta ropa
Y seamos solo piel

Nos hace bien que nos bien que nos tomemos esta noche
Para amarnos más que ayer

Nos hace bien que jugando a las escondidas
Al fin perdamos la duda que nos vacila
Nos hace bien que nos vallamos a la cama como la  primera vez
Nos hace bien que nos miremos como amantes
Y así desees estar conmigo como antes	
Nos hace bien que apaguemos ya las luces y enfundamos nuestra fe

Nos hace bien que le digamos hoy al miedo no te quiero ver jamás
Nos hace bien que construyamos un castillo
Y seamos como niños sin tener miedo a jugar
Nos hace bien que nos salgamos de esta ropa
Y seamos solo piel

Nos hace bien que nos bien que nos tomemos esta noche
Para amarnos más que ayer
Para amarnos más que ayer
Y amarnos más que ayer

Nos hace bien",Nos Hace Bien
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Pienso en ti en el auto estoy llegando
Recordando aquella luna en el fondo de tus ojos
Las señales de la carretera se me acercan y se alejan
Como este amor de nosotros...
Pienso en ti sintiendo tu perfume
Y me pierdo en una nube una luz me da en la cara
Para despejarme prendo el radio
Me sorprende estan tocando
La cancion que te cantaba

Pensando en ti pensando en ti
Volviendo a ver nuestra pelicula completa
Reviviendo cada escena
Pensando en ti pensando en ti
Con la pregunta que tortura mi cabeza
Y que no tiene respuesta
Por que cuesta tanto ser feliz
Ojala que cuando llegue estes ahi

No se ve muy bien esta lloviendo
Rayas blancas pavimento
Sigue la monotonia
Justo aqui a mi lado va tu asiento
Es un testigo el silencio contemplando mi agonia
Cuantas noches bellas cuantos besos
Cuantos sentimientos nuevos
Compartimos y estrenamos
Marco tu telefono por ratos
Sigue igual desconectado
Y me voy desesperando

Pensando en ti pensando en ti
Volviendo a ver nuestra pelicula completa
Reviviendo cada escena
Pensando en ti  pensando en ti
Con la pregunta que tortura mi cabeza
Y que no tiene respuesta
Por que cuesta tanto ser feliz
Ojala que cuando llegue estes ahi

Como llegamos a esto
En que perdemos el tiempo
En herirnos y en sufrir
Siempre es mas fuerte el impulso
Tu me culpas yo te culpo
Para luego estar asi

Pensando en ti
Volviendo a ver nuestra pelicula completa
Reviviendo cada escena
Por que cuesta tanto ser feliz
Ojala que cuando llegue estes ahi",Pensando en Ti
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Hey, ven acá dime ya  
Donde rayos te has metido  
Donde estas  
Ven, Belén, Belén, verén, ven, ven, ven  
Se que no fui lo mejor que ha pasado por tu vida  
Pero al menos reconozco hice el intento  
Hey, ven acá dime ya  
Que se hizo aquel momento tan feliz  
Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu  
Cuando juramos pasar  
El resto e la vida juntos tu y yo  
Hay que nos paso  
Dime que haz hecho con el si  
Los besos que te di  
Con tantas veces que te ame  
Con loco frenesí 
Y que hay de las copas de vino y tequila  
Que tu derramaste en mi cuerpo perdida  
Dime que haz hecho con mi amor  
Es ciego este dolor el que estoy sintiendo por ti  
Por que no estas aquí 
Si sabes que muero que sufro  
Y que lloro si no estas conmigo  
Si no estas conmigo  
 
Hey, ven acá dime ya  
Por que escondes en silencio ese dolor  
Hay que dolor que dolor que pena  
Ve mas haya de tu voz  
Y recoge los pedazos y los sueños  
Que dejaste en mi regazo  
Dime que haz hecho con el si  
Los besos que te di  
Con tantas veces que te ame  
Con loco frenesí 
Y que hay de las copas de vino y tequila  
Que tu derramaste en mi cuerpo perdida  
Dime que haz hecho con mi amor

Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Yo que te busco y no te consigo  
En donde estas donde te haz metido  
Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Vuelve que tu me haces tanta falta  
Como al pan le hace falta el trigo  
Hey, ven acá no te tardes ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Fueron tantas noches de tequila y vino tinto  
Que te embriagaste de olvido  
Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Yo te di lo mejor de mi  
Tu no estas aquí 
Me tienes perdido  
 
Vuelve Camínalo  
 
Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
 
Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Hey, ven acá me he cansado de buscar  
No te puedo encontrar donde te haz escondido  
Hey, ven acá necesito estar contigo  
Tu no estas conmigo  
Yo me quedo intranquilo  
Necesito estar contigo  
Que tu hiciste con el si  
Que me habías prometido  
Necesito estar contigo  
Por que mi vida sin ti  
Oye no tiene sentido  
Necesito estar contigo  
Vuelve vuelve que parece  
Que se te olvido el camino  
Necesito estar contigo  
Yo muriéndome por dentro  
Sabes que te necesito  
Necesito estar contigo  
Hey, ven acá que paso  
Yo no se  
Necesito estar contigo",Reproche
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Tocan a la puerta 
Alguien me interrumpe 
Voy a ver 
Quien llama 
No resisto a nadie 
Hoy estoy contigo 
Metida en el alma 
Tarde he comprendido 
Que el error fue mio 
Y en el mismo instante que mas 
Te adoraba 
Tocan a la puerta 
Voy de mala gana 
Abro la puerta y estas tu 
Y quedo inmóvil ante ti 
Sin decir nada 
Tiendes los brazos hacia mi 
Y ni me puedo sonreír 
Estoy helado 
Por dentro soy como un volcán 
Temblando de felicidad 
Enamorado 
Te veo mas firme mas sensual 
Y veo en tus ojos la ansiedad 
Que yo esperaba 
Abro la puerta y entras tu 
Y me aprisionas junto a ti 
Cara con cara 
Y todo gira sin cesar 
Pienso que voy a desmayar 
Tanto te ansiaba 
No hay una frase de dolor 
En tu silencio esta el perdón 
Que yo soñaba 
Me voy del brazo junto a ti 
Hacia la cuna de mi amor 
Enamorado 

Por dentro soy como un volcán 
Temblando de felicidad 
Enamorado 
Te veo mas firme mas sensual 
Y veo en tus ojos la ansiedad 
Que yo esperaba 
Abro la puerta y entras tu 
Y me aprisionas junto a ti 
Cara con cara 
Y todo gira sin cesar 
Pienso que voy a desmayar 
Tanto te ansiaba 
No hay una frase de dolor 
Y en tu silencio esta el perdón 
Que yo soñaba 
Me voy del brazo junto a ti 
Hacia la cuna de mi amor

Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo
Se llevo la tristeza que había en mi corazón 

Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo
Y me trajo cosas nuevas que valen un  millón 

Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo
Eso si no me dejo el premio la lotería 

Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo
Pero me trajo eso por montón 

Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo
Ahora que se esta acabando
Lo que me dejo lo que se llevo

Y en lo malo que me regalo 


Que pena me da que se vaya el año , que cosas vendrán con el año nuevo ya casi comienza el año nuevo que cosa traerá ya lo veremos
Que pena me da que se vaya el año ,que cosas vendrán con el año nuevo que traiga la paz sin que traiga el amor deje la guerra bien lejos

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"La fiesta va a comenzar 
Y tengo una orden severa 
De quien venga como quiera no dejarlo entrar 
Póngase un saquito para que pueda gozar 

Yo voy a pasar 
Pero que yo voy a pasar 
Y es que yo voy a pasar 

Un momento caballero 
Por favor no pase usted 
Que tengo una nueva orden 
Que aquí mismo cumpliré 

Pero señor si yo vengo con corbata 
Saco puesto bien portado 
Por que me va a dejar aquí en la puerta parado

Contra todos los pronósticos
Aunque tú no me creas
Aunque no te suene lógico

Aunque el mundo se oponga
Aunque acechen las sombras
Yo estaré aquí
Y siempre al lado tuyo  por qué no?


Si yo te amo con mayúscula
Si para mi tú eres única
Si eres mi norte, 
Eres mi brújula


Aunque llueva, aunque truene o ventee
Aunque la tierra sacuda y caigan mil paredes
Aunque llueva, aunque truene o ventee
Aunque el cielo se nos nuble
Aunque azoten mil tormentas por tu amor
Yo aguanto lo que venga


Para hacer de nuestro amor lo nunca visto
Soy capaz de atravesar fronteras
Para amarte la vida entera
Yo podría derribar barreas
Desafiar la tempestad

Aunque llueva, aunque truene o ventee
Aunque la tierra sacuda y caigan mil paredes

Aunque el cielo se nos nuble
Aunque azoten mil tormentas por tu amor

No temas no lo tienes que dudar
Aunque se acabe el mundo
Porque pase lo que pase tu y yo seguiremos juntos
Por tu amor soy capaz de luchar
Tiempo bueno, tiempo malo ya veremos qué vendrá
Aunque se acabe el mundo
Caigan truenos, rayos, centellas o la tierra tiemble

Que lo nuestro es una alianza y va a durar para siempre

Venga lo que venga, aunque los tiempos sean crueles

Aunque la marea suba, se que no voy a perderte","Aunque Llueva [Llueva, Truene o Ventee]"
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Escurre el velo del silencio
En una silaba te llevas mis angustias
Suave caricia que me eleva que me gusta
No te conozco y ya de amor me estoy muriendo

Escurre el fuego de tu arrojo y me pregunto
Porque no te tuve siempre si es en tus ojos
Donde llego nuevamente a comprender que
Puedo amar eternamente

Como he podido estar sin ti
Como se puede respirar en el vacío como se
Vive con el alma en el abismo sin el calor
Inagotable de tu abrigo
Como he podido estar sin ti
Como se puede navegar sin tu cariño si no habrá
Nada mas allá de estar contigo
Preferiría naufragar en el olvido

Me robo un beso de tu boca y me perfuma
El dulce olor de tu inocencia me has
Convertido en la razón de mi existencia
Nunca sabre como vivir sin tu presencia

Como he podido estar sin ti
Como se puede respirar en el vacío como se
Vive con el alma en el abismo sin el calor
Inagotable de tu abrigo
Como he podido estar sin ti
Como se puede navegar sin tu cariño si no habrá
Nada mas allá de estar contigo
Preferiría naufragar en el olvido

Como se puede respirar en el vacío como se

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Volví a pensar en ti como si hubiera sido ayer que nos separamos
Me regresó el sabor la mente me llevó a sentir tus labios
Qué extraño yo pensé haberte olvidado pero algo tuyo se niega a morir

Una cosa me llevó a la otra, un recuerdo trajo otro recuerdo
Y me vi de nuevo comiéndote a besos
Me quemaba el alma una pregunta, la llamo ahora o no la llamo nunca
Acabé colgando, terminé llorando
No se pueden revivir amores del pasado

Volví a pensar en ti cuando sin querer doblé aquella esquina
Me vi frente al lugar que fue nuestro lugar de amor y fantasía
Qué extraño yo pensé haberte olvidado pero algo tuyo se niega a morir

Una cosa me llevó a la otra un recuerdo trajo otro recuerdo
Y me vi de nuevo comiéndote a besos
Me quemaba el alma una pregunta
La llamo ahora o no la llamo nunca, acabé colgando, termine llorando
No se pueden revivir amores del pasado

No sé si sueña conmigo
En las noches como yo
Si alguna vez ha sentido mi voz en su corazón

Una cosa me llevó a la otra, un recuerdo trajo otro recuerdo
Y me vi de nuevo comiéndote a besos

La llamo ahora o no la llamo nunca, acabé colgando, terminé llorando

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Yo no vi cuando el amor me llenaba a través de tu mirada
Yo tenía cerrada el alma y por eso no lo vi
No lo vi cuando se estaba entregando
Cuando me estaba quemando la pasión entre 
tus brazos y por eso te perdí
Y ahora no sé no sé qué hacer sin ti

Mírame ahora hablando solo en este cuarto con una foto
Prisionero de un error que cometí
Mírame aquí lamentándome sin ti
Mírame ahora triste y perdido decepcionado conmigo mismo
Soportando como puedo este dolor que no se va
Viviendo a medio corazón arrepentido

Yo no vi lo mucho que tú me amabas 
Porque mi vida agitada sin querer nos alejaba y al final yo no lo vi
No lo vi porque el amor me asustaba y aunque no sé qué buscaba
Cuando vine a darme cuenta que era tarde para mi
Y ahora no sé no sé qué hacer sin ti

Mírame ahora hablando solo en este cuarto con una foto
Prisionero de un error que cometí
Mírame aquí lamentándome sin ti
Mírame ahora triste y perdido decepcionado conmigo mismo
Soportando como puedo este dolor que no se va
Viviendo a medio corazón arrepentido

Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
A medianoche el recuerdo a media luz la habitación
Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
Fue muy tarde y te perdí cuando cuenta 
yo me di de que eras mi salvación
Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
Hablando solo, peleando conmigo por estar metido en esta situación

Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
Mírame ahora soñando contigo perdido en mi confusión
Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
Viviendo de mi vida la mitad que se me va por esta equivocación
Mírame hablando solo a medio corazón
Quise a estas cuatro paredes hablar y 
contarle lo que yo les digo en mi conversación

Mírame ahora triste y perdido decepcionado conmigo mismo
Soportando como puedo este dolor que no se va
Viviendo a medio corazón arrepentido, arrepentido, arrepentido",A  Medio Corazón
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Te quise a tiempo te quise tarde te quise dentro de lo que cabe
Con toda la fuerza del que sabe hacer un cuento con la realidad
En la única pasión de mi carne llamé hasta la incredulidad
Te di la puerta te di la llave te di todas las ganas de amar

Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer

Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Cuando todo acabe

Sentir alivio perder el miedo beber de un sorbo los manantiales
Bajar la calle de los deseos pisar el freno nunca me gustó
Subir hasta tu boca y dejar que se fundan el beso y la intención
Como se funde la gloria de amarte, castigo y pena, verdad y razón

Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer

Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer

No te equivoques que yo no soy la roca
Domina más tu lengua controla más tu boca
Que las palabras suelen hacer más daño
Se clavan en el alma como si fueran clavos

Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer así como yo quién te va a querer
Cuando todo acabe

Así como yo quién, quién te va a querer
Quién te va a querer quién te va a querer de esta manera 
con esta pasión y esta entrega que te di mi ser
Así como yo quién, quién te va a querer
Cuando se acaben los caminos cuando te cambie 
tu destino y pierdas el último tren

Así como yo quién, quién te va a querer
Aquí yo estaré esperando sin rencor 
ni reprochando pa’ quererte como ayer

Camínalo otra vez
Te quise tanto que no me lo vas a creer
Quién, quién te va a querer

Busca busca por el mundo porque no va a aparecer
Quién, quién te va a querer
Aunque tu alma tu cariño me arriesgue yo aposté y no gané
Quién, quién te va a querer
Y quién te va a querer quién te va a querer

Que me sirva mi experiencia para la próxima vez
Quién, quién te va a querer
Te quise sin frenos sin pausa pero fallé

Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Si te vas te vas pero no regreses
Que es mejor a veces sufrir al final
Que llorar llorar una vida entera

Pues la soledad durará muy poco
Tu y yo solo somos agua y sal
No le des más vueltas al reloj de arena
Rompe las cadenas y a orar

No me debes nada llévatelo todo
Que a ti te hará falta para comenzar
No me debes nada cada uno por su lado sin mirar atrás
Y que la suerte te acompañe pero si te vas te vas

Llévate mis caricias mis besos 
Y también nuestras noches de excesos
Y la puerta que lleva los sueños que te regalé
Llévate en el baúl de tu ropa tus promesas y esta derrota
Pues la lástima es enemiga de la felicidad

No me debes nada llévatelo todo
Que a ti te hará falta para comenzar
No me debes nada cada uno por su lado sin mirar atrás
Y que la suerte te acompañe pero si te vas te vas

Si tú te vas te vas te vas te vas te vas te vas y yo me quedo solo
Ahora que me quedo solo que me dices que te vas

Si tú te vas te vas te vas te vas te vas te vas y yo me quedo solo
Te vas te vas te vas te vas te vas pero yo me quedo aquí

Que no puede encontrarte defectos porque no tienes
Si yo fuera tú le haría caso a un tipo como yo
Que te va a dedicar alma y cuerpo para siempre

Ese que vemos sólo en las novelas pero que un día de repente llega
Si yo fuera tú definitivamente me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Porque nadie más te a va a cuidar y amar como mereces

Si yo fuera tú no perdería un segundo me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Porque dolería un día darme cuenta que fue duro tenerte y perderte para siempre
Si yo fuera tú le daba un chance a un hombre como yo
No quisiera llorar un error eternamente

Porque dolería un día darme cuenta que fue duro tenerte y perderte para siempre
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Me enamoraba que me diera la paz que yo anhelo vivito y entero el calor del amor
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Me enamoraba me enamoraba no lo pensaba

No perdería la oportunidad de disfrutar la felicidad por nada
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Aprovecharía el momento que la vida me dio
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Y no perdería el tiempo diciendo que no

Si yo fuera tú
No me perdería este chance
Si yo fuera tú
Porque pudiera ser único
Si yo fuera tú
Y viviría este romance
Si yo fuera tú
Igual que si fuera el último

Pa qué complicarse pa qué equivocarse
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Si conviene la primera no espero a la dos
Si yo fuera tú
Ahora que tengo de frente
Si yo fuera tú

Esto que me da la vida
Si yo fuera tú
Y le doy alegremente
Si yo fuera tú
Al amor la bienvenida
Que si yo fuera tú
Si yo fuera tú
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo

Que no lo pienses más tu sabes qué soy yo
Si yo fuera tú me enamoraba de alguien como yo
Que el tiempo pasa de prisa y lo que se perdió se perdió
Si yo fuera tú
Juégatela y ven conmigo
Si yo fuera tú
No tengo mas que decirte
Si yo fuera tú
Y una vez que esté contigo
Tú no vas a arrepentirte no",Si Yo Fuera Tú
Gilberto Santa Rosa,"Anda bien despacio hasta mi cuerpo
Rózame los labios con tu piel
Suelta ese vestido por el suelo
Olvida la prisa y despójate de miedos

Antes que te vayas para siempre quiero que bailemos otra vez
No podrás negarme lo que sientes serás mía hasta el amanecer

Baila corazón no mires las horas del reloj
Porque pasa el tiempo y pasa todo y la noche acabará sin duda
Baila corazón dile que me muero sin su amor
Dile que sin ella no soy nada
Que se quede aquí en mi alma por favor
Porque esta noche bailaremos tal vez el último bolero ella y yo

Déjate llevar por tus deseos
Calma las locuras de tu ser
Llora el desencanto aquí en mi pecho
Dile que me amas aunque sé que estarás lejos

Y antes de marcharte para siempre baila este bolero una vez más
No podrás negarme lo que sientes no querrás que llegue a su final

Baila corazón no mires las horas del reloj
Porque pasa el tiempo y pasa todo y la noche acabará sin duda
Baila corazón dile que me muero sin su amor
Dile que sin ella no soy nada
Que se quede aquí en mi alma por favor
Porque esta noche bailaremos tal vez el último bolero ella y yo

Y baila bien por si acaso este dolor que 
encierras ya no te deja bailar conmigo baila

Baila corazón dile que me muero sin su amor
Dile que sin ella no soy nada

No es preciso decir
Que me muero por ti
Que no vives sin mi

Tu cabello tu olor
Se me va la razón

Somos dos cuerpos en un corazón

Que en las madrugadas
Arden de pasión
Somos tequila y canción
Lluvia de estrellas de noches de amor
Como el mar y el cielo

I begged give a dying man his last drink 
He handed me a glass with just the worm and he laughed 
I pulled a switchblade from my boot and shoved it in his throat

When you look across the meadow 
Then you’ll be mine only in rhymes
That I’ll sing for you and you’ll never know 

Dreams we have shared and dreams that have dared
To come true are worth a lifetime 
Happy I’ve been, just to have seen
The dream of your lips wet with mine 

Why should we cry at the end of the day when sunrise brings light from above? 
We’ve always known everything must end – if life and death are one so are we 
Shouldn’t we love, love 

Sometimes I wish to take you along
On my selfish journey love song
I could be led to stay in your bed
Dream on in my mind
Make love in my mind
Tomorrow will find
I’ll be gone

And the world we know deceives us 
Hold me tonight, stay in the light

With those graveyard eyes and those lies I heard you say, Desiree

Desiree after all these years you got me falling off my feet
So please tell me now, what's got you so afraid Desiree

Underneath your burnin' sheets to face a blind mans doom
Had the trouble in yours eyes, makes it hard for me to say, Desiree

With a belly full of bourbon and a heart full of pain
Looking for somebody that maybe can
But in vain Lord, I can't run more anywhere
It's two in the morning in this American town
And true love can't be found

Loneliness in the middle of nowhere
Nobody cares who you are
Happiness can't even go there
Passed out at the end of the bar

Give me my heart, she sold me her lies
While blowing right through me with her hurricane eyes
Mathematicians have a problems, just don't get along
Now everything is broken, everything's gone wrong
I should have left it in Paris but could not refuse
One more chance to lose

Loneliness in the middle of nowhere
Nobody cares who you are
Happiness can't even go there
Can't kill by a fallin' star

Strange world, with a stranger everyday
While only yesterday I heard a stranger say
My heart's been broken and mended so many times
It looks like Frankenstein

She's only got these words on a stone

We cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why",Annabelle
Gillian Welch,"Oh the night came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
The smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls
And they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls 

Well she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind 
And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
But eave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls 

Oh the barroom girls go by your side
Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
And all of the colors go 'round in a swirl
When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls 

Now she rolls to her feet when she can't sleep no more
And looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls",Barroom Girls
Gillian Welch,"When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my savior
By the mark where the nails have been

By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior when I come to him
By the mark where the nails have been 

A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the king of heaven 
Can be told from the prince of fools

Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for

Gillian Welch,"A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me

So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I'd come home forever

[Chorus]
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home

No work said the boss at the bunkhouse door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances

[Chorus]

A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me

Gillian Welch,"There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky
And twice as many tear drops
there to wash it down 
Every one's another lullaby 

But there's only one and only 
Who could go and leave me lonely 

There's a world of trouble
Trying to take its turn 
I can hear it shaking underground 
And half a dozen lessons
I might never learn 
Not until them troubles come around 

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely 

There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize 
Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind 
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes

Who could go and leave me lonely

You're the only one and only 
Why'd you go and leave me lonely",Only One and Only

But the ties of kinship I have not known them
I know no mother no father

But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother my father

But you made me feel that they were heaven sent
Paper wings, not real at all

But they took me high enough to really fall
Your paper kisses faded too soon
Just like a paper rose beneath a paper moon
Paper wings, paper wings

Oh how could I expect to fly with only paper wings
Angels were singing, didn't you hear
If only I'd listened close when they whispered in my ear

Oh tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace of the hiding place
Where I made that evil stuff

For all my time and money no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me
When I was a child way back in the hills
I laughed at the men who tended those stills
But that old mountain shine, it caught me somehow

For all my time and money no profit did I see

Gillian Welch,"Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
He made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time

Late one evening in back of my house,
Caleb came around
He called my name 'til I came out
With no one else around

[Chorus]
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains.
But when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your husband gone?
Did he go down off the mountain side
And leave you all alone?

Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
To do some business there.
Then Caleb threw that bottle down 
And grabbed me by my hair.

[Chorus]

He threw me on the needle bed,
And on my dress he lay
He held my hands above my head
And I commenced to pray.

I cried My God, I am your child
Send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips,
The bottle neck I found

I pulled that glass across his neck
As fine as any blade,
And I felt his blood run fast and hot
Around me where I laid.

On the road from Lexington

One rider, one rider beatin' the breeze
Down on his saddle, low to his knees
Comin' through my willow trees

Now closer, the terrible work of the gun
Was stiffened and black where his blood all had run

Came to my door unable to rest
Even in the arms of death",One Morning

Gonna guide me on to greet her

Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler,

Like you never seen

Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
How he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
He shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake

Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
He shook it and he shine like gold
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul

Gillian Welch,"When the iceberg hit,
Oh they must have known,
God moves on the water
Like Casey Jones.

So I walked downtown
On my telephone,
And took a lazy turn
Through the redeye zone.

It was a five-band bill,
A two-dollar show.
I saw the van out in front
From Idaho,

And the girl passed out
In the backseat trash.
There were no way they'd make
Even a half a tank of gas.

They looked sick and stoned
And strangely dressed.
No one showed
From the local press.

But I watched them walk
Through the bottom land,
And I wished that I played
In a rock & roll band.

Hey, hey,
It was the fourteenth day of April.

Well they closed it down,
With the sails in rags.
And I swept up the fags
And the local mags.

I threw the plastic cups
In the plastic bags,
And the cooks cleaned the kitchen
With the staggers and the jags.

Ruination day,
And the sky was red.
I went back to work,
And back to bed.

And the iceberg broke,
And the Okies fled,
And the Great Emancipator
Took a bullet in the back of the head",Elvis Presley Blues

Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call

Where did last years lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow

And walkin' on the narrow way

I know that if I can not meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity

Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long

And it's no one else, no fault but my own
And I've been in the low lands too long

What is this weight in my mind
And what is this new sense of time
It's the open fields and the friends that are gone
And I've been in the lowlands too long

I can do nothing all the day long
But I can't so right and I know I'm wrong

Gillian Welch,"Look out boys, 'cause I'm a rollin' stone
That's what I was when I first left home
I took every secret that I'd ever known
And headed for the wall
Like a wrecking ball

Started down on the road to sin
Playin' bass under a pseudonym
The days were rough, and it's all quite dim
But my mind cuts through it all
Like a wrecking ball

Oh, just a little deadhead
Who is watching, who is watching
I's just a little deadhead

I won a dollar on a scholarship
Well, I got tired and let my average slip
Then I's a farmer in the pogonip
Of a weed that I recall
Was like a wrecking ball

Met a lovesick daughter of the San Joaquin
She showed me colors I'd never seen
Drank the bottom out of my canteen
Then left me in the fall
Like a wrecking ball

Standin' there, in the morning mist
A Jack & Coke at the end my wrist
I remember when first we kissed
'Though it was nothing at all
Like a wrecking ball

Hey boys, a little deadhead
Who's watching, who's watching
I's just a little deadhead

With too much trouble for me to shake
Oh, the weather and the blindin' ache
Was ridin' high until the '89 quake
Hit the Santa Cruz Garden Mall

Don't ever treat me unkind

Now I see the bones in the river
And I feel the wind through the pine
And I hear the shadows a-calling
To a girl with a dark turn of mind

But oh ain't the nighttime so lovely to see?
Don't all the night birds sing sweetly?
You'll never know how happy I'll be
When the sun's going down

And leave me if I'm feeling too lonely
Full as the fruit on the vine

And some have a dark turn of mind

And some girls are blessed with a dark turn of mind",Dark Turn of Mind

Down along the Dixie Line
Banjos are strumming
Horseflies are humming
Ripe melons on the vine
The gold and the grey weeds
Sing look away
Way down along the Dixie Line

I spent my childhood walking the wildwood
Down along the Dixie Line
Freight trains are squalling 
Eyeballs are bawling
Four engines at a time
I was so happy with Momma and Pappy
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear those drivers way?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball man
Leave that North Land far behind

A river of whiskey flows down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
They pulled up the tracks now
I can't go back now
Can't hardly keep from cryin'
Oh do they miss me way down in Dixie

Gillian Welch,"There was a camp town man, used to plow and sing
And he loved that mule and the mule loved him
When the day got long as it does about now
I'd hear him singing to his muley-cow
Calling, ""Come on my sweet old girl, and I'd bet the whole damn world
That we're gonna make it yet to the end of the row""

Singing ""hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more""

Said it's a mean old world, heavy in need.
That big machine is just picking up speed
They were supping on tears, they were supping on wine
We all get to heaven in our own sweet time
So come all you Asheville boys and turn up your old-time noise
And kick 'til the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor

Singing, hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, brother
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more

But the camp town man, he doesn't plow no more
I seen him walking down to the cigarette store
Guess he lost that knack and he forgot that song
Woke up one morning and the mule was gone
So come on, you ragtime kings, and come on, you dogs, and sing
And pick up the dusty old horn and give it a blow

Playing, hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, honey
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, sugar
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more",Hard Times

Never been there before
Well you slept on a feather bed

I don't mind a little town
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I spent some time in New Orleans
And ?
A Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been

You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like holly on a mountainside

Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door

So fare you well, my own true love

I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town

The sun comes up, babe, but it's hard to get my fill
Your blue serape, it fits my mood
I'm through with Bibles and I'm through with food
Somebody's calling, trying to track me down
And if I don't answer, I'd hang around
I slide past lovers lost in the dark
I look for high ground for to build an ark

I can't remember when I felt so free
Maybe September, the year you believed in me
In 1900 and 99
When I found the angels a-drinking wine
Seems every castle is made of sand

Maybe I could meet her
He thought I was a trader

Her eyes were black her hair was raven

Eighteen years she looked a woman
I thought she'd been around

She'd never met a jailbird
I knew that she was lonely
She offered me her body

Back in Galveston beneath the Georgia moon

I was countin' change for a cab ride back to bed
She looked to me through the cold night air
And thoughts of you kicked off inside my head

To make me feel just like a woman should

Did you love me?  Only in my head.
Things you said and did to me
Seemed to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

I found out about you

Rumours follow everywhere you go
And when you left I was last to know

In all the places you hang out
They know your name and know what you're about

It's rollin' around the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine
Since I don't know when

Well, I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
That train keeps rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My mama told me, ""Son
Always be good boy
Don't you ever play with guns""

But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that lonesome whistle
I hang my head and cry

Well, I bet there's rich folks eating
From a fancy dinin' car
I bet they're taking mushrooms
And smokin' big cigars

Well, I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
Those people keep movin'
And that's what tortures me

If they free me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
You bet I'd move it on
A little farther down the line

Yeah, far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to be
But those people keep movin'
Goddammit, that's what tortures me

I figured all this time by now we'd grown
Can you wake up suddenly feeling pleased
Been walking all this time while down on your knees

I can smell those brackish waters
I swear I've had this feeling here before
Come on hard at night I pine for you and no other
I promise I won't hurt you anymore

And thinking all this time I'm right and I'm not
I cannot help myself and I know it's not your fault

Mix me up with secret chemistry

To hell with her 
It's not hers to forestall

Undermining it all

The night moves close to me 

If you're gonna leave on your own 
And take the whole world down alone 

Life -- it's always just out of reach 
Was it there at my parents' house 
Maybe just down that street 
But your mind 
However lacking it feels 
Still I'd trade you away today 
For some feeling that's real

It?s yours to take on alone 
If you're gonna leave on your own

When you're bored 
So sick of your song 
When whole worlds just disappear 
Swallowed up and gone 

When you're down 
Down how far can you go 
Raise the future in a wasted past 
Everything unknown

Means nothing to me 

If you're gonna leave on your own

You swim in the pourin' rain, and I'm holding on in vain

The more I try, the more that I just feel so far away

So the story goes and I'm not over you

Burnin' bright, but sadly faded

But I'm sorry that we made such a mess
Out of Love
I don't understand the pressure
Could this day get any better?
A long way from hard times I Win you again
The dark roads and hard snows
How could I know?
We just make it all up as we go

So give me something real
That I can lay my head on
No fairy tales or Dreams
I'm sick of make believing
I made a promise long ago
It all fell apart I don't wanna let go
C'mon give me something real

I don't know any better
But I know that I've made some mistakes with your love
I can't help but think
It matters
The illusion finally shatters

A long time gone now to win
You again time slows hearts
Froze how could I know?
I just make it all up as I go

Gin Blossoms,"Can you take a lot of pain
And make a little game
Of the hell that you find
All the space you never gave
For a secret never safe
Get it out of your mind

The past beyond my sight
Ahead in blinding light
That reflects in your eye
The choices that you make
All the memories and mistakes
I only think about it sometimes

[Chorus]
This is the last time I'll ever Say
I love you
This is the last night
I fall among these graves
The and last time that I'll
Cry and walk beneath a dark
Lonely sky and wave bye
Bye, bye bye

I could take
The bitter
Cold
And wrap
Around your soul
In the light of your lie
All the things we'll never be
They were right in front of me
I can ever deny

A piece You never sold
You only feel a little cold
And slightly undone
The harder part of facing doubt
Standing up and climbing out
The deepest hole you've
Ever dug

[Chorus]

A piece You never sold
You only feel a little cold
And grown so tired
To want and never grow
In delusion of control
The hardest part is
Getting old

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?

Where my baby used to lay?

Two drinks of gin.

Who I trusted whom, I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had
I've always been so glad

Together we were strong

Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down

A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears

Befriend the glorious end of the line

Ginger Rogers,"There may be trouble ahead

Before they ask us to pay the bill

Nought be all else to me
Save that thou art

Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light

Ginny Owens,"Turnin' molehills into mountains,
Makin' big deals out of small ones,
Bearing gifts as if they're burdens,
This is how it's been.
Afraid of coming out of my shell,
Too many things I can't do too well,
Afraid I'll try real hard, and I'll fail
This is how it's been.
Till the day You pounded on my heart's door,
And You shouted joyfully,
""You're not a slave anymore!""

""You're free to dance-
Forget about your two left feet
And you're free to sing-even joyful noise is music to Me
You're free to love,
'Cause I've given you My love(repepte after bridge),
And it's made you free
After Bridge(I have set you free!"")
 
My mind finds hard to believe
That You became humanity and changed the course of history,
Because You loved me so.
And my heart cannot understand
Why You'd accept me as I am,
But You say You've always had a plan,
And that's all I need to know.
So when I am consumed by what the world will say,
It's Then You're singing to me, as You remove my chains-
 
Free from worry, free from envy and denial
Free to live, free to give, free to smile",Free
Ginny Owens,"I could travel over oceans, cross the deserts, climb the mountains
Just to share your story, bring you glory, and win souls for you.
I could sing like an angel, songs so humble and so thankful
Full of drama and emotion, so the world would know your truth.
I could give away my money and my clothes and my food
To restore those people who are poor, lost, and down-and-out.
Oh, I could succeed at all these things,
Find favor with peasants and kings,
But if I do not love, I am nothing.

I could live a flawless life,
Never cheat or steal or lie,
And always speak so kindly, smile warmly, and go about doing good.
I could dedicate myself to do what everyone else wants me to-
Listen to them, compliment them, say the things I should.
I could show up every Sunday, lead the choir and bible study
And they all might come to know me as a leader and a friend.
Oh, I could achieve success on earth, but success cannot define my worth
And all these actions, all these words, will not matter in the end-

Songs will fade to silence,
Stories, they will cease.
The dust will settle, covering all my selfless deeds.
So as I strive to serve you,
Won't you make it clear to me,
If I do not love, I am nothing.

If I cannot live my life loving my brother,
Then how can I love the one who lived his life for me?

Sent to earth from heaven,
Humble servant, holy king,
Come to share a story, get no glory, and save my searching soul,
You knew that I'd deny you, crucify you, but nothing could stop you from
Living for me, dying for me, so that I would know-

Songs will fade to silence,
Stories will cease,
The dust will settle covering these selfless deeds.
But your life here has made it clear enough for me to see
That if I do not love, I am nothing",I Am Nothing
Ginny Owens,"There's a young Mother with three children
Got a stable income and a faithful husband, too.
She's searchin' for her life's meanin',
So she says to her shrink, ""I'm leavin' home soon!""
Just decided that she couldn't take it anymore,
Didn't look back, she just snuck out the back door-

We applaud this behavior
Admire how she breaks away-
Oh, it's so clearly cloudy, in the land of the grey.

There's a young Senator,
Gifted politician,
So consumed by pursuing his career.
Use to care about what the people wanted,
But now he's learned how to say what they want to hear.
A million lies and scandals bear his name,
But you'll never see him hide his face in shame-

[Chorus:]
What is wrong with this picture?
We applaud this behavior
He's a hero if he makes mistakes-
Oh, it's so clearly cloudy in the land of the grey.

What's wrong? What's right? Absolute confusion.
What's black? What's white? Everything looks hazy.
Such scenarios bring me to only one conclusion-
Maybe we've all gone crazy.

Three little kids are prayin' Mama comes home,
And a little town feels violated and betrayed.

A thirsty pilgrim with no water to drink.
And this barren place is making me crazy,

Down at the inner-city mission

For every victory there's a failure

He'll say, ""I know where I'd be if Christ had given up on me-""

Beneath the symbol of a lost cause
Is where I take my stand.
Beneath the emblem of a Roman cross
of a Sacrificial Lamb.
Cause love never claims the victory
Till it finally gives it's all.
And that's why the grave is empty
Beneath the symbol of a lost cause.
I've been a slave to popular opinions,
And I've memorized the Gospel of success,
I've had a taste of the politics of power
And the glamour that commands the world's respect.
But when my eyes are turned to Jesus,
Nailed on a Cross to die for me,
I hear a cock crow in the distance
And it shatters my illusions and drives me to my knees-

Ginny Owens,"You find this situation just a bit uncomfortable;
You'd rather stay far away from reality.
For you to understand would be clearly impossible;
So you shut your eyes and swear you can see.
Claiming there is a God, but does that mean anything?
So condescending to those that you don't understand;
Just too easy to make them your enemies.
Like an ostrich, you bury your head in the sand,
And then shout about all the things you believe.
But if there is a God, don't you think He can see
What you really mean? What you're doing?

[Chorus:]
You can't find the answers
Till you learn to question;
You won't appear stupid
Just ask for direction.
You're insecure and it clouds your perception
So stop and listen
And learn a lesson in love without condition.
So place all the souls that you know
in their own little box;
Quite convenient to handle them that way;
You're the only one you know who carries a cross
You don't care what they care about anyway.
And You talk to your God,
Prayin' for those who sin,
For their eyes to be opened.

Let Your words be mine
Let them see that Your love
Is the reason I'm inspired

May they recognize Your voice
Let them hear You through me, O Lord

But we won't tell him, we just stop to block his way with stones
I watched a woman, overtaken by disease
We fell upon her suffering, instead of offering the cure she needs

How quickly we forget what we've been rescued from

If not for the hand that leads us
We too would roam in the darkness
If not for the hand that heals us
We would live in pain

Our hands have power, they can harm and they can heal
We raise them in praise and honor
We use them to stone and steal
With his two hands, one that rescued history
Said he came for the sick and sightless
He said that was you and me

If not for the hand that leads us
We too would roam in the darkness
If not for the hand that heals us
We would live in pain

But still we keep our distance
Caught up in our false pretenses
Only by the hand have we been changed
Compelled by the gracious hand that chose to change this life for us
Won't we choose to use our hands to give the world his love?

If not for the hand that leads us

To lead them out of Egypt when they've been there so long?
And anyway, they won't believe You ever spoke to me.

And through you I will show them, I Am.

Too small for battle gear with a giant to destroy.
What on earth can he do with five stones and a sling?

The storms of disenchantment crashed
And my ambitions were scattered by winds of doubt
And it wasn't long 'til I learned ot see

So when the winds of change try to blow me over
And the shadows of confusion hide the truth
I will hope in the One who is forever
I will run to You

Ever since the moment life began 
Humankind has tried to solve its mysteries
So many things we cannot comprehend
So we draw conclusions that we can believe
Well, I know that Your hands have placed the earth upon the seas
And pitched a tent in the Heavens for the sun
The author of the universe is the father who loves me
So, only one conclusion can be drawn...

When I face the questions that seem to have no answers

The way it used to be
When your love was new to me
I just want to love you, simply love you
To hear what you say and live every day
Like you asked me to
I just want to simply love you
Many times you spoke of us as children
Childhood seems to me so long ago
You say I can trust you like I did then
If I give you my hand then you'll lead me home

Joy that came because you sacrificed
Since you gave yourself just to spend forever with me
Surely I can trust you'll lead me through my darkest times
When I ask why....(Chorus)
From here I can not see
Why you'd choose this path for me

Some say You are the only truth,
And some say You're a fraud,
Some think we invented You
Some call you God
Some say You were a noble man,
Very kind and good,
Some think You were a prophet just misunderstood
But I'm content to always be,
A witness to your mystery
And even though I've never seen Your face,
I have heard You calling out my name
",I Know Who You Are
Ginny Owens,"I love poetry with brilliant rhymes,
And songs that draw me in
With clever opening lines
I love rainy Sunday afternoons
Being kissed by sun,
And dreaming under the moon
The way the ocean feels at high tide,
The gentle stillness of midnight, Oh I-
I love the way You are so good to me,
I love the way You're so inspiring,
I don't know why You love me like You do,
But I love You.
I love all the signs of city life,
And marvel at the way
The world just hurries by
I love breathing in the mountain air,
Climbing to the top,
And finding that You're there
Catching glimpses of Your mysteries,
I find Your fingerprints on everything
What I mean
I hear Your music everywhere,
So gentle, yet so strong,
Your melody floats on the air,
And every time I hear You there,
I've got to sing along",I Love the Way
Ginny Owens,"I've been grazing in the lush green pastures,
Watching time pass me by,
And I've been wading in the shallow waters,
Where everything is all right-
But today I know that something's different,
Something's disturbing my peace,
Oh, I can feel the changes in the distance,
And hear them calling to me-
The day is here, the time has come
To sing a new song,
It's very clear, I must move on,
And sing a new song,
It will define who I become,
This new song,
So show me how to sing along
To this new song-
I've been looking in the strangest places,
To find the source of my strength,
And even though the outcome never changes,
Still I search endlessly,
But no more wandering around in circles,
It's time that I cross the see,
Now I'm trading in my cozy corner
For the bigger mystery
Going there means leaving here,
Saying yes means saying no,
Moving on means letting go of what is sure,
For more",New Song
Ginny Owens,"I've lived a lot of life,
Seen so many things,
And I like to think,
Nothing surprises me,
So I try
To take it all in stride,
No matter what tomorrow brings
But Your plans for me
Aren't predictable,
And I find Your dreams
So incredible.
Never commonplace,
And in so many ways,
Always wild and wonderful
Oh, You keep me guessing,
Holding on tight
For the ride of my life
With You, all I can say,
There's no such thing as an ordinary day.
Since You write the script,
I must confess,
I don't always know
What will happen next,
Takes my breath away,
Takes a lot of faith,
'cause I don't know what to expect
Every time a new adventure unfolds,
I realize that I'm not the one in control",Ordinary Day
Ginny Owens,"I'm knocking on Your door,
Won't you answer?
I'm waiting for a word,
Or just a whisper;
But if You can't answer me this time,
I can handle everything just fine
Cause somehow I seem to think I have power,
And I know best how to make things better,
I try to carry everything alone,
But now the time has come to let go
To trust You with my life,
To believe You all the time,
And to leave my doubt behind,
Oh to trust You with my life.
Will I ever learn to stop and listen,
To keep knocking on Your door until it opens,
Teach me what it means to believe,
That You are strong enough to carry me
Oh, to trust You with my life,
To believe You all the time,
And to leave my doubt behind,
Oh, to trust You with my life.
And to give You everything,
All the deepest parts of me,
And to know You're always right,
To trust You with my life.
Broken here before You on my knees,
Is my only hope of finding peace",To Trust You
Ginny Owens,"This is your life
And yet somehow
They decide
What you're about
You learn your lines
And take your cues
But who are you listening to?

You change your clothes
And how you speak
You place your hope
In what they think
Before you know
There's no more you
Who are you listening to
Have you noticed how much you fear
All the voices you choose to hear?

Who are you listening to?
Who tells you what to do?
Who rules your thoughts at night?
Whose rules define your life?
Oh, you know it's up to you
So, who are you listening to?

This is your life
You have no choice
You will rely
On someone's voice
And it's all right
To question who
Who are you listening to?
Do the words that you believe
Set your soul and spirit free?

There's a quiet voice
Whispering in your heart
It's been there all along
It believes in you
It will tell the truth
Can't you hear it call?",Who Are You Listening To
Ginny Owens,"I've been feeling a little bit overwhelmed,
I've been a little too wrapped up in myself,
So many things to cloud my mind,
I need to leave them all behind,
And think about a place and time
Beyond this life
Won't that be fine,
Oh when the sun always shines,
Nothin but love all the time,
Oh won't that be fine.
I love to get caught up in this daydream,
I smile to think about all that I'll see,
And any need I've ever had,
Any question that I want to ask,
Won't even matter
Gone with the past
Oh won't that be fine,
Oh when the sun always shines,
And there is love all the time,
Oh won't that be fine,
And won't that be fine,
When everything wrong will be right,
And when we will walk in the light,
Won't that be fine",Won't That Be Fine
Ginny Owens,"You can't change who I am
Or the way that i think
I won't change how you live
Or the words that you speak
But neither of us is a stranger to joy or pain
No matter how we're different 
We're very much the same

Chorus:
Fellow traveler let me take you to a place where Ive found rest
Fellow seeker let me show you where I've found true happiness
Fellow beggar I have good news, I know where there is bread
(I'll show you where there's bread)

I don't know where you've come from 
Or where you've been along your way
But I can tell you what I've lived through
And how I made it here today
Let me share with you the story of hope I've come to know
A love that's always for me
And a peace that frees my soul

So if you are hungry come to the table with me
And you won't go hungry ever again

Ginny Owens,"Trying to think, 
Save it for another day
Nana send me to an early grave

To a song on the radio
'Bout a heart that was broken
By a love gone wrong
Then I turn my attention
To the news on tv
Tells a mortal affliction

Such an urgency
That we need each other
So desperately oh can't you see

It's a long way home 
It's a long way home
Lets walk together 
Instead of alone
On this long way home

Of a lot of magazines
Full of angry looking rock stars
And airbrushed beauty queens
And next to each picture
Is a caption that read
Oh your life will be better
If you have what we have
And the message grows louder
As we fall further from grace 
So lets speak to each other 
Of a better place

Oh 'cause its a
Long way home
It's a long long way home
Lets walk together
Instead of alone
On this long way home

And ought to be restored before it dies

Staring out my window

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

Stellina scendeva vicina, vicina

Gino Paoli,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

The issue is not really if it's right or wrong
But as long as it's clean .... right

Were only synthesized in the delusion of a flower child scene
There's a new star in an old space
So it's time you open your soul and set yourself free
Sing a new song of totality
Get a new fix for seventy six
So we thought we were cool and free
But then our heros blew their minds

Look out for the evil eye

Who was that damsel with that wicked stare?
Get off my case and take your sins elsewhere

You love and learn, you cross that bridge
You want to pacify
The tables turn and you've dug your ditch
Look out for the evil eye

Oh look out!
Oh look out!
I said look out!
I said look out!

You live and learn, you make mistakes
You wonder how and why
The fire burns for heaven's sake
Look out for the evil eye

Oh look out!
Oh look out!

'Cause she a dark angel riding dark horses
Sitting pretty in her dim lit covers... I say

She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps
For all those phantom lovers in her dreams
She smokes them french cigarettes
In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress
She cuts a perfect silhouette

A fading beauty as the night time passes... I say

We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again

And it hurts to be in love

I'm always worried you think I'm pushing too hard
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me I'm going to far

Every moment that she holds me tight
I know just where I stand
As I am the other man

She leaves my room like a criminal
To beat the morning light
Rehearsing ever little alibi
To get it water tight

There's a note on the dresser top
It's the same old classic line
She says she's leaving him
It's just a question of time
It's a no win situation

His life hanging by a thread

Too many echoes in my head
Too many fires left burning
In this bed
Too many thoughts of desperation
So much pain deep down below
So mych a slave to my senses
I can't let go

From moment to moment
I live and I die
This can't go on anymore
Another day, another lie
From moment to moment
I stand and I fall
This can't go on anymore
Unless we both give it all

I ask you how can a man keep his distance
How can he reason with his heart
How can you hold me so near
Yet keep me so far

From moment to moment
I live and I die
This can't go on anymore
Another day, another lie
From moment to moment
I stand and I fall
This can't go on anymore
Unless we both give it all

Sometimes I'd like to break you down
To see if there's a trace of woman in you that could be found
But I just keep prayin' you'll come around
And live from moment to moment
I live from moment to moment
I live from moment to moment

So much a slave to my senses
I can't let go

From moment to moment
I live and I die
This can't go on anymore
Another day, another lie
From moment to moment
I stand and I fall
This can't go on anymore
Unless we both give it all

You know I want to give it all
I live from moment to moment
Everyday of my life
I live from moment to moment

Rich man poor man and a desert in between
Crystal chandeliers hangin' by a thread

And I hear gabriel blowing his saxophone
Through a great big hole in the ozone
Who cares it the sun don't rise
When I look in to your ultraviolet eyes

This is my blood
This is my people
The black drums leaking in their graves
The tin cans rocking on the arctic waves

The curse that rushes through her tiny veins
For every rose that wilts away

The rockets standing 'neath the western plains
This is my greed
This is my glory

The crimes of hate our young sons glorify
For every mouth that yearns for bread
The heart of stone proclaiming
God is dead
For every soul that lost its way

Invader of my heart
Look at me, behaving like a fool possessed

Undress her - do I dare
Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast
Ah, the sun best come up soon
There's no telling with the moon over madness
And when I see her face
The tuft of hair beneath the lace
I feel the fire of mortal men
As she draws a languorous breath
So full of life, so close to death
I'm filled with wild revenge
Shall I tear into her skin
Let the beast inside me win
I'm so uncertain
Or shall I fight my heart no more
Ease my lover to the floor
And loose my burden
What I'd give to know just what I am
A monster or a man
An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh

Shall I tear into her skin
Let the beast inside me win

Or shall I end this lonely war

Gino Vannelli,"Hail to the shaman and his cardboard drum and the riffraff
Dancing in the sun
I sing for thee
Praise to the ugly and the dispossessed and the genius born of
The viper's nest
You have set me free
Hey, you cranks and you clowns with your heads hanging down
I bring good tidings to you
For all the talent that he has Jehovah don't play jazz like the devil do
See the rose sprung from the heap of dung
The shafthorse hot and heavy hung shamelessly
Check the star dust oozing in the mud on it pilgrimage to flesh and blood
Now ain't that you and me
Hey, you Shakespeares in rags little heretics and hags
To thine own self be true
Well, he may be beautiful and king but Jehovah he don't swing like the devil
Birdman, Birdman, what's the word, man
Into the night we go
Billie, Billie, knock me silly
Sing to me soft and low
Save me from losing my soul to a heaven as cold as ice
I'd sooner be a free man in hell than a prisoner in paradise
So I toot my toot for the man with roots
Hey, fifer on the E-flat flute play on, play on
All you sinners and you infidels you you artful madmen bound for hell
Come sing along
Come on, you potty-trained saints spouting' isms and ain'ts
Dig the poetry my man
Well all deference to his throne
Gabriel he don't play no saxophone like Coltrane can
Now, save me from losing my soul to a heaven as cold as ice
I'd sooner be a free man in hell than a prisoner in paradise
I'd sooner catch fire than kill my desire
Hail to the shaman and his cardboard drum and the riffraff
Dancing in the sun
I sing for you
For all the talent he has Jehovah don't play jazz like the devil do
Yeah, the devil do
Must admit he do
Ah, da devil do
Birdman, Birdman, what's the word, man
Into the night we go
Billie, Billie, knock me silly
Sing to me soft and low
Foll all the talent that he has Jehovah don't play no jazz ....",Jehovah and All That Jazz [Live][#]

Speaking about my problems, speaking about what's on my mind
Never had a true reason
Whether I'm gonna be here or leaving
Never had an address
My life's been nothing but an ugly mess
Talking to a whole lot of people
Telling me that my life was not going to be created equal
But my manager R.R. he had a bunch of plans
Ran into J.D. he engineered the plan
Then what Michael Caplan
Hooked us up with Polly and she signed the ""G"" man
Hey back to the basics
L. West had to live my legal statements
She's means so much to me
She hooked us with Ron Sweeny

Trying to make advantage and complete our dreams

I was there for you
Undeniably
Time over and time again
You shut me out
I thought I was your man
I kept it real with you
But you was fake with me

I start thinking things
Is this love real love
And all that it brings
When I close my eyes
Only you I see
With another man
This is killing me

I am your man
But only when you're lonely
If I was to bounce
That's when you'd want me
I am your man
But only when you're lonely
You say its not the same
But I love you only

My heart got broken
When my heart got opened
Repeatedly. You said you needed me
You cheated me
I'm tired of being all alone
Since you won't call me on the phone
I've got it together now I'm gone
Lone gone, listen

I start thinking things

Only you I see

Hard to plead the case like son not fly,
Hoping that I fall off and don't come back,
But I married the game when I made one stack,
So you can get used to my face cos I ain't leaving
I ain't going nowhere tonight, stop breathin'

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Ginuwine,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

She's out of my life, She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life

It's out of my hands, It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
And the way that it stands
She's of of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I learned, Love won't wait
Now I've learned, that love needs expression
But I've learned too late
And she's

Out of my life, She's out of my life
Damned in decision
And cursed in pride
I kept my love for her, locked deep inside
And the way that it stands

In my Range Rover
Rollin down the ave pumpin out my new hits
I think to myself it's cool, so I keep reading 
And it's you sayin that she saw me cheatin
Now I'm all confused baby
Then I get a grip it's just a little thing that I'm dealin with
Why she hatin on me? I don't really know what this is all about 
But I'm finding out
Then my mind wanders 
Start thinking back at the party 
When she was all up in my face
And up on me
And grabbing on my arm and telling me things like how she was the bomb
Now for me it's clearer, that instead of you 
You don't see the truth but she
wants me near her

Now don't believe a thing your girl say
She wants to have what you have all
it is is jealousy baby put your trust in me

you're the one I'm living with
Giving all my stuff and shit
So why you want to doubt our love
Don't let her break our world
Before you question me you need to check your girl
She done dished out more then she can take 
And her ass can't handle it
But you're my woman and we're one 
And I'm not having it
But it's alright, yes it's ok
I'm sure you believe in me and I'm sure you can see the truth in me baby

How deep is your love girl let's get serious 
How deep is your love girl I'm so curious 
How deep is your love girl can I fall in it 
How deep is your love girl can I get close to it 

we've kicked it for a little while you know 
I think it's time for us to start to move ahead 
We both been patient and that's cool and all 
But I'm in need of you and you don't seem to even care 
we've been in slow mo 
Never swung an episode 
So what's man to do 
Stay or go cheat on you 
Tell me baby what are you so scared of 
I'll be real gentle when I'm making love to you 

[Chorus]

There ain't a thing you can't get from me 
Whether it's ice, money come what may 
I did everything you asked of me 
But you must simply do not feel the same way 
How longer do you need 
can't you easily see that I'm the one for you 
Tell me what I should do 
Whoever hurt you made it rough for me 
But you are you, I am me, he was he 

[Chorus]

This love can't go unspoken 
You got me wishing, hoping 
You must let your judge lout 
we've been through it all before now 
This time we make that move now

Let's not play, not yo games

People gonna say what they want to say
But they don't really know me babe,
Hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're

If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
Me put your fears to rest

I quit it 
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to 
You and only, I'm your man

I can understand why you're insecure, doing 
All I can just to reassure
Seeing all these women at my stage door, screaming

Hard to believe 
But they don't mean a thing to me, I am

And it's too much to bare, and I'm so awfully scared

I need someone who loves me

You're insinuations are screaming to me
That you're really hurt (so hurt)

You seem so awfully scared

And I'm all alone, I'm so all alone

Didn't want to go on without you daddy (Still at night I cry)
I still can't understand why did you have to leave me
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain, now I blame myself
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, cause when your parents
Are gone it's hard to believe
That is part of life, that you must go on 
They would want you to still be strong

Momma when you left, felt like my soul had gone
I still remember the day, had no words to say my heart was gone
(Still at night I cry)
You were the reason I lived, you gave me life that was pure
Always kept me so sure of everything, I miss you so

Why did you take your love away

I've been single, been lonely, and hating every second of it baby
I can't sleep right, one mo' night, cause I miss the lovin' from my lady
I would give up almost anything to get you back into my life

What's the problem, can we talk baby, I thought our love was real and true
You can tell me, I'm all ears girl, There's nothing we can't get through
Whatever the problem is we'll work it out, don't break up a happy home
Life is nothing without love to share and I don't want to be alone

And we're both from the hood
Your playing hard to get now
That's probably why your by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by
And you persist to try to entertain
All of them things that you probably just heard
None of its true and that's my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear now
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go
Tell me why

[Chorus:]

I'd like to think I'm a good guy so tell me why not me
Can't blame you though if all your ex-boyfriends did you shady
But don't take that out on me girl
Oops I got to take it back its your world
Baby I'm just that guy ill show you why
If you just give me one try
I'm telling you I don't get down like that
Can't play the role
Or play myself
I just got to get in that's for sure
Got a little money
I spit game to the honeys
But you're all a nigga needs
I won't give you chicken feed

[Chorus:]

You should tell me something something
Can't imagine me just wanting
Put your cards out on the table
Baby I'm willing and able
Picture that me dippin' on ya
What the use if I'm up on ya
I'm the one you searched so long for
Give me one chance and you'll want no more

Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

[Chorus: x2]

[Ginuwine]
You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
'cause I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover want to beg to earn, oh baby

[Chorus: x2]

[Ginuwine]
I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two
Days and I'm open to, the point that I propose to you
Must think I'm some kind of fool, don't you
You can call it what you're thinkin'
But I'm thinkin' we gon' jump that broom

[Method Man]
Back-seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Her neck and wrist all froze, I'm trynna catch a cold
Clippin' the trey, we sippin' away
On that 'Ze, innovations, slowin' slippin' away
Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention 'cause they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, y'all understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine

I Was ready to change the game
You forfeited my love and still livin' the same
I felt like I was just wanted for the fame
It's a bit silly to think I would look again
'cause you have lost this nigga and a damn good friend
I thought you stick around but you couldn't stay
I was looking forward to those better things
I guess it's just the problems that the chedda brings
Just the problems that chedda brings

Thought I finally found my soul sista
Convinced I had it all, fell in love quicker
Been going through it all this time
And now I'm so sick of, your games
I'm so sick of your games
Girl, you're fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Must be out your mind or on some strong liquor
How could I stay with ya you right after neighborhood's been with ya I can't
You've already had your chance spending, all my Benjamin's

[Chorus]

She was a San Francisco gold digga
And she knew how to put a hole in a nigga pocket for the cold figgas
Chain you up and whip you take your Polaroid pictures
Oops, blackmail when she get annoyed with ya
Oh, she the type to do her thing
Type to lock you down, for half of the estate
From around the way
So fellas beware of the fuckin' game
She'll ruin your name and empty all the savings just the same

[Chorus]

[Jose]
Jose had this biddy testing her game
Usin' her black gold
That's what I guess she gets out my pockets
Chains like a lasso
It's past dough she's after my G's
Plus my reality
I max though payin her rent and now she mad at me
Is that so
Sayin' well Jose you bout to blow
Doin' songs wit Ginuwine, Sole, and little mo
I'm' like
What you talkin'
I don't know G and he don't know me
And you been talkin' sideways a little often
That's why when my thing softens
I start to loose interest
A gold digga with a fetish for riches
So bear witness
She the difference 'tween women and chickens skeazas and sistas
'cause the chedda brings change in the game

Now I'm in the cell,
sitting by my self,
wondering what the hell has happened,
My freedom has been taking from me,
now I'm liars, shysters and killers rapist, and robbers even drug dealers,
I don't want my life ending here,
I got 5 minutes on the phone with my girl and I'm lonely,
and niggas already screaming phone check homie,

I want to go home, I ain't down with this,
I can't start to tell you all the things I will miss.

Ginuwine,"You saw me sittin' all alone, at the bar with my hat tipped low
Drinkin' a glass of gin with no ice
And even though I sipped it slow, it would burn like a volcano
That's when you came sat down and said hi
And you didn't even recognize who I was but I didn't mind,
Cause I didn't feel like signing autographs
You saw me as a normal guy and you treated me oh so nice
You just wanted to know why I looked sad 
That's when I said

[Chorus]
I'm sad cause I hurt a soul tie
And when she left my soul died
Thought we'd be together for life 
(thought we'd be together for life)
I lost her because of my damn pride, 
I'm a man that can't cry, but look at me now, 
With my face in the ground and a glaze in my eye.

I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff 
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought cause now I got a glaze in my eye.

And it's harder to hide, my runny nose and my throat is dry
But I'm still tryin' not to let it show
I'll just blame it on the alcohol, cause it makes me think I'm strong, 
But that's some bull and we both know (we both know)
I can't believe I told some waitress, all of my personal business
And I ain't really believe you'd understand, but you did understand
You said everyone has issues, then you passed me a tissue
And told me that cryin' is what shows that I'm a real man

[Chorus]

I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff 
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought, cause now I got a glaze in my eye.

I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff 
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought, cause now I got a glaze in my eye.",Glaze in My Eye
Ginuwine,"As the day goes by I'm always thinking of your face
Your hair, your eyes, your sweet lips, and the way they taste
You got me going on a high that I have never felt
A beautiful thing (Not like the same thing)
This thing we've got it so amazing what I love the most
It's how we can talk and how we laugh and the fact we're so close
It's illusion but it's magic 
No tricks involved 
With you I got it all (With you I got it all)

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
Do you hear me?
Was so scared
Not prepared 
But it just hit me
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
And it's a good thing
Many miss out on things
Real lovers bring
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love

In my mind I'm in a world alone just you and I
You're my Eve and I'm your Adam so let's start new life
It's the way you make me feel like a new beginning girl
In all different ways (So many different ways)
You was still strong and had my back now the foundations laid
And I wanna spend the rest of my life just fulfilling you
With everything you want everything you need

[Chorus]

It's one of those things and
It's real hard to explain but
It's real and fills your heart
And hearts just don't lie no
You will know real love
Cause nothing feels like it and
It touches things inside
It's a real experience

Girl I know your pain and it hurts so deep
Ive been there before (ive been there before)
But baby you will see
That we've all been hurt (all been hurt baby)

Better to have loved
Then not have love at all

Know where you gon' be by the end of the night

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Running over the same old ground
And how we found

(I'm gonna do it) If this is my last chance, yea

The things I said, I can't believe it
But I swear to God, I didn't mean it
But it takes a lot from me, to admit I'm wrong
But I'll do whatever to save my home, cause
I keep going back, back, and forth
In and out, out the door
Don't want to fuss and fight no more
Don't give a damn about the score, cause I, I'm a different kind of man

Hating that I lost what I had in you,
If I could turn back time

I would make a change and
Never do the things that I done to you
I see you're doing good
Shawty your career is taking off like mine
And what we could have done together what a shame
I'm 'bout to lose my mind

Only what could've been, yeah

That special thing we had
I should have worked it out, oh

But seeing you with him,
I know his name's on it now

And I been through all the change
It's roaming now a days

In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

que me quieras de nuevo

Y si quiero salir, tú te quieres quedar

Appena entri l'accoglienza è tipo questa qua
Ale ale oh oh, ale ale oh oh.

Wow, andiamo nella suite,
Con cinque stelle addosso, baby, come J&J.
Sei troppo zozza bitch, sei la più zozza bitch,
Sei cosa zozza che ti fotto vestito da Ris.
Vuoi fare cin-cin? Sennò, facciamo il bis,
Ti fai toccare quando voglio touchscreen.
Hai curve tipo drift, trema il palazzo.
Ma quale miss? Al massimo, mi succhi il cazzo.
Schiaffoni forti a mano aperta, sul sedere,
Che per due settimane non ti riuscirai a sedere.
La musica di fondo e il rumore delle cerniere,
Sono come Zalando urli di piacere.
Non mi capisci? Do you speak English?
Ti faccio un fist-in così forte che il braccio sparisce.
Sii ragionevole, ti vengo addosso,

Non dir minchiate, non sei una modella,
Sei brava a scopare. Hai fatto la bidella?
Finita l'ora, suona la campanella.
Sei rosa con le macchie bianche mortadella.
Infilo la mia testa nel tuo big boot, zia.
Ci rimango dentro per almento due minuti, zia.
Tu muovilo, muovilo, muovilo finché non sudi, zia.
Sono tipo una sarta, ti riempio tutti I buchi, zia.
Ti insegno come toccare le palle come un mister,
Facciam più posizioni di quando si gioca a Twister.
Fammi un chinotto, non mi piace il ginger.
Il mio punto debole è la figa tallone da sgrille.
Ti chiamano Gesù, perché riesci,
A moltiplicare senza trucchi tanti pesci.
E se c'è il tipo, me ne fotto.
Io ti ho sottovalutata, tu mi hai valutato sotto.

A dire il vero non lo so,
Se io qua sto bene
Assieme a sti problemi,
Oppure un giorno me ne andrò.
E ora mi chiedi come sto,
Scusami se ti ho deluso un po',
Capisco se vai via
È solo colpa mia
E di questi momenti no.

Come sto? Sto come sempre
Perchè non vedo
Il futuro dentro
Una palla di vetro,
Ho deluso me stesso
Prima di te
Dici che non so amare perchè
Sono troppo concreto,
Se mi guardi negli occhi
Vedi un vicolo cieco
Dono forma e dubbi di amleto,
Io non sono facile,
Tu nemmeno,
Ma se lo fossimo ci annoieremmo.
Se vai via capisco le tue ragioni,
Sono le conseguenze delle mie azioni,
E non sempre c'è il tempo per rimediare,
E non è una lezione,
Ti ripeto per imparare.
Ho avuto tanto dalla sorte
Ed ho gettato tutto via,
La mia vita è un'emorragia,
Vorrei che fossi tu a fermarla,
A salvarmi, a cambiarmi, a calmarmi.

E ora mi chiedi come sto
A dire il vero non lo so,

Assieme a sti problemi,

Come stai? la solita domanda a casa mia,
io sto bene, la solita bugia.
Come vuoi che sia cresciuto,
A casa tu chiedevi aiuto ai tuoi,
Io lo chiedevo a Google.
Tu non sai quanto fa male
Quando dalla finestra vedi I mei vicini
Che stannno cenando,
Loro a tavola, in quattro,
Con un sorriso a testa,
Mentre io sono da solo
A guardarli dalla finestra.
E quando faccio il letto
Trovo sempre I suoi capelli rossi,
Sparsi qua la tra le lenzuola,
Vorrei poterli unire,
Sentire ancora dire,
Se li preferisco lisci, ricci o mossi.
Ma dopo ci ho pensato,
E ora quando penso al mio passato
Chiudo gli occhi e una voce mi dice
Che il peggio è passato.
Ora guardo avanti,
Ma stavolta io non cambio pagina,
Cambio proprio libro,
Punto e a capo.

E ora mi chiedi come sto
A dire il vero non lo so,
Se io qua sto bene
Assieme a sti problemi,
Oppure un giorno me ne andrò.

Non mi guardavo allo specchio,
Per capire se in fondo questo,
Ero proprio io.
E solo adesso so che,
Dovrei pensare più spesso,
A stare più con me stesso.

Gionata non è quello che pensi,
Gionata tu non lo hai conosciuto ed è meglio per certi versi.
Gionata non è quello che vedi ai concerti,
Gionata non è quello che ascolti nei pezzi.
Sono cambiato perchè m'han cambiato sappilo, sappiatelo,
Anche il diavolo prima era un angelo,
Me ne sbatto ho sempre avuto un motivo valido,
Fare lo stronzo con chi è stronzo ha un suo fascino.
Gionata rivuole gli anni dove non sorrideva se usciva con una nuova,
Ma se usciva il sole, ma oggi piove,
E lui si gode il temporale,
Tanto anche se è bel tempo i ricordi fan male uguale.
Gionata è contento soltanto per GionnyScandal ma,
A Gionata in fondo cosa gli cambia,
Avere pieno il conto in banca,
Se dentro resti vuoto,
Come se ci fosse sempre qualcosa che manca.

Non mi guardavo allo specchio,

Ero proprio io.
E solo adesso so che,
Dovrei pensare più spesso,
A stare più con me stesso.

Io non lo faccio apposta ad esser sempre giù, sai anche tu,
Che le carezze sui graffi si sentono di più.
Quante volte ho chiesto scusa dalla rabbia,
E all'esame di coscienza avevo i bigliettini in tasca.
Ti rendi conto che ti manca vivere,
Quando attacchi i post-it sul frigo per ricordati di sorridere,
Perché la vita in fondo è come il mare,
Non gliene frega se non sai nuotare!

Gionata darebbe il suo successo,
Anche adesso,
Per riavere indietro tutto ciò che ha perso.
Firmerebbe assegni,
Non importa il prezzo,
Oltre al buongiorno dai suoi fans vorrebbe quello del suo vecchio,
Papà mi chiedo spesso,
Se sai qualche mio pezzo,
Chissà se in paradiso c'è il wifi,
Ma presto,
Verrò li in paradiso a fare un live, promesso.
Ti voglio in prima fila insieme a mamma, vi aspetto!

Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare
Ma forse è normale
Perché hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Chissà se mi starai ascoltando
Chissà dove sei
Chissà se lui ti ama davvero
Io non direi
Dimmi dov'è il nostro futuro
Se il giorno prima era un ti amo
E il giorno dopo un altro vaffanculo
Non ti chiedevo tanto
Non dovevi fare altro che ascoltarmi
E fidarti l'ultima volta soltato
Ma non l'hai fatto
E sai che penso da un paio di sere?
Che avremmo fatto invidia al mondo noi due insieme
Vorrei scriverti un messaggio di due parole
Ma se le scrivo il mio iphone mi da un errore
Non dare colpa al mio iphone ma al mio dolore
Perché a volte il dolore cambia le persone
E dopotutto ti volevo ringraziare
Perché è solo grazie a te se adesso non so più amare
E la vuoi sapere un'altra cosa?
Amare e soffrire sono la stessa cosa

Eppure fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare
Ma forse è normale
Perchè hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Eppure quanto fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare
Ma forse è normale
Perchè hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Soffro di philofobia per colpa tua
E il dottore dice che non c'è una cura
E che non devo aver paura
Se le relazioni fossero così importanti
Anche Dio ne avrebbe una
E se vuoi proviamo a uscire
Poi vediamo se va meglio
Ma I tuoi baci fanno troppo male
Lasciano uno sfregio
Sai mantenerlo un segreto?
L'amore è una malattia baby e senza si sta meglio
Se ora vieni e mi baci
È chiaro che non sorrido
Se ora dici che cambi io è chiaro che non mi fido
Ci ho messo anni e mesi e alla fine l'ho capito
Il verbo restare non è sempre un verbo all'infinito
E si capisce troppo bene che sei finta
Tutte le tue bugie le hai nascoste dietro al tuo fondo tinta
E se era amore a prima vista
Ci tocca prendere appuntamento da un oculista

Eppure fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare

Non devo aver paura di ricominciare
Vado avanti e non ci penso più
Ho ancora tanto tempo per incontrare
Quella che volevo fossi tu
È solo la paura di soffrire che mi spacca il cuore
Ma tutto passa prima o poi

Che mi faccio il culo
Che vi faccio il culo
Fra grazie a nessuno
Grazie a me e a mia madre
Fin quando c'è potuta stare
Grazie a mio padre
Per gli schiaffi che mi è riuscito a dare
Sono cresciuto solo
Fra dentro un oratorio
Assieme a un gameboy color
Con su Pokemon Oro
Ora sti ragazzini fra in giro
Son tutti loro
Che se eravate miei figli
A calci in culo fino al matrimonio
Mai avuto il vostro aiuto
Mai avuto qualche mano
Né dai miei parenti
Né da quelli che io consolavo
Il capobranco di me stesso
Come um husky siberano
Non avevo il piatto pronto
A 12 anni cucinavo
A quelli che sanno chi sono
Va un grazie sincero
E per quelli che parlan per niente ho trovato un rimedio
Mi tatuo il simbolo dell'infinito sopra il dito medio
Così vi mando a fan-culo per sempre e mi tolgo il pensiero!

È stato meglio,da un lato
Perchè se provi a dirmi addio io sono abituato
E a tutti quelli che mi hanno ferito un miliardo di volte
grazie perchè ora sono più forte
Avrei dovuto andare a scuola
Ma saltavo le lezioni
Mamma voleva che studiassi
E non pensassi alle canzoni
Scusa se non ti ho ascoltata spero un giorno mi perdoni
Oltre alla musica nessuno mi ha dato soddisfazioni
La mia ex ragazza in giro di me chissà che racconta
Certe stanno zitte solo se le metti il cash in borsa
Certe stanno zitte solo
Se le metti con te in mostra
Certe stanno zitte solo
Se le metti il cazzo in bocca
E forse l'unico difetto mio che non sopporto è solo
Che soffro da sempre di sindrome d'abbandono
Ora non piango più da un pezzo
E se mi mancherai sappi che troverò un motivo per sorridere lo stesso!

solo con un abbraccio forte, non con le botte

accadere la stessa cosa con tua figlia

In 'sto periodo rifletto su una cosa
sembra che amare davvero una donna ormai sia fuori moda
Non posso cambiare lui perché è nato già bastardo
Ma posso cambiare te e darti forza per farlo
Oltre a darti qualche abbraccio, coraggio
il segreto è tornare quella che eri prima di incontrarlo
Per lui eri sola a mezzanotte, adesso non ti ha più

Vorrei scrivere il mio nome sulla luna perchè,
Ogni notte prima di dormire guarderesti me
E se ancora tu mi piaci
È colpa dei tuoi baci
Siamo bravi a litigare e a lasciarci non siam capaci
Qua passano le ore,
Non abbiamo più l'amore
Scopiamo solamente per non sentirci soli
E anche se lo so che ogni cosa ha una sua fine
Vivo insieme alla paura che questo potrà finire
Tanto troverai di meglio di come lo riesci a dire
A far passare tutto questo non bastano due aspirine.
E' troppo tempo che ci siamo persi ormai
Non ho più neanche il coraggio di chiederti come stai
Quindi se vorrai
Il mio numero ce l'hai
Aspetto un tuo messaggio anche se so che non lo manderai

E chi se ne frega se litigo con te
Ogni due per tre
Chi se ne frega

Io non ho niente
E vorrei darti tutto quanto
Sono bravo solo a far canzoni
Eppure Dio dice che ho ragione
Eppure Dio dice che ho ragione
Quando dico come te una su un milione

Forse in matematica non ero molto bravo
Ma con te ho imparato che il doppio di sei è siamo
Quando mi hai detto se ci tieni inizia a dimostrarlo
Io ti ho chiesto scusa,ho pianto e non ho risolto un cazzo
Come fai a darmi la colpa
Se ogni volta
Mentre cerco di chiarire tu esci e sbatti la porta
Le chiavi del mio cuore le avevo già date via
Ma per fortuna in casa mia ho tenuto quelle di scorta

E adesso non sorrido più nemmeno quando sto con gli altri
Quando mi chiedon come sto rispondo che mi manchi
Gli amici mi ripetono di non pensarci e basta
Che ne troverò un'altra e tutto passa ma è una frase fatta
Vorrei sposarti sulla luna mentre splende
E farti partorire tra le stelle più belle
E quando mi chiedevi hai tutto cosa vuoi di più
Se ti ricordi io ti ho sempre risposto soltanto tu

Il cuore mi fa un male atroce
Dimmi qualcosa fai veloce
La mia canzone preferita è la tua voce
E questo amore quanto nuoce

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with the shape of you",My Yiddishe Mamme/Donna Donna
Giora Feidman,"Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, ""strike up the band""

Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To the martial swing, strike up the band

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
You son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike up the band!

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
Come on, son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Come on, let's go
Hey, Mr. Leader, 
Hey, Mr. Leader,
Please strike up the band!",Mode Ani
Giordi Orreggio,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Giordi Orreggio,"I'm sayin' all the things that I know you'll like
Making good conversation I gotta handle you just right, you know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant, then to a suggestive movie
There's nothing left to talk about 'less it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

I've been patient, I've been good, try'n to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back, you know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view, we know each other mentally
You've gotta know that you're bringin' out the animal in me

Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Oh let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get animal, animal, I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, let me hear your body talk",Physical
Giorgia,"Polvere
Cielo che verrà di notte
Polvere
Infinito è
Nelle mani nascerà
Aria volerà
E ali di alba avrà
Polvere
Vento bianco che colora
Polvere
Luminoso è
Nelle mani nascerà
Acqua danzerà
E viso di alba avrà
Respirerà la via
Sereno profumo resterà",Alba
Giorgia,"Vabbè vabbè
Vabbè vabbè

Che mattina fredda sarà giugno
Ma alle 7 meno un quarto io c'ho freddo
Gli esami non li fanno mai di sera
Che caffè schifoso sarà buono
Ma alle 7 meno 5 io c'ho sonno
Potevo andare a letto un poco prima

Esco piano piano non ti sveglio
Gira a tutti male la mattina
Guarda già che traffico ho trovato

Ma è il momento tocca proprio a me
(M'hanno bocciato)
Oh mamma mia, non mi succede proprio mai
(M'hanno bocciato)
Potevo mettere la minigonna capirai
(M'hanno bocciato)
Come la racconto, come mi defendo se
(M'hanno bocciato)

Vabbè vabbè vabbè

Che figura nera che vergogna
Gli ho trovati tutti lì erano brutti
Gli esami è brutti e brutto è chi li fa, tiè
Giacca e la cravatta tutti scuri
Già alle 8 meno 5 erano veri
Sembrava un sogno eppure era realtà

Esco piano piano non li guardo, no
Giran tutti male sta mattina
Io che non so più dove guardare

È meglio correre scappare via
(M'hanno bocciato)
Oh mamma mia, non mi succede proprio mai
(M'hanno bocciato)
Potevo mettere la minigonna capirai
(M'hanno bocciato)
Come la racconto, come mi defendo se

Oh mamma mia, non mi succede proprio mai

Potevo mettere la minigonna capirai

Come la racconto, come mi defendo se
(M'hanno bocciato)
Deve un pò studiare che le manca musicalità
(M'hanno bocciato)
Forse è l'emozione signorina però qui non va
(M'hanno bocciato)
Certo se riesco a uscire qui non ci ritorno più
(M'hanno bocciato)
Non ci ritorno più
Come la racconto dove mi nascondo se
(M'hanno bocciato)
Oh mamma mia, non mi succede proprio mai
(M'hanno bocciato)
Potevo mettere la minigonna capirai
(M'hanno bocciato)
(M'hanno bocciato)

M'hanno bocciato a me, m'hanno bocciato
Cha andavo così bene a scuola
Alla maturità io 60 ho preso, 60
E m'hanno bocciato maledetti quant'erano brutti
Eppure io sapevo tutto, m'hanno bocciato
M'hanno bocciato
Vabbè, e non va bene mica tanto
No no",M'Hanno Bocciato
