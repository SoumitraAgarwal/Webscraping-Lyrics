Amado Batista,"A solidão que dormiu comigo
Não conseguiu o meu corpo aquecer
De madrugada gritei seu nome, chorando sem perceber

Mais a saudade mentiu pra mim
Ela não trouxe você

'Tá faltando a flor, 'tá sobrando espinhos
Machucando meu coração
Morrendo de amor, tô aqui sozinho
Nas garras da solidão

'Tá doendo, que sufoco
Meu amor 'tá com raiva de mim
'To sofrendo, feito um louco
Vida minha não faz assim",Ta Com Raiva de Mim
Amado Batista,"Que saudade daqueles tempos
Tempos que não voltam mais
Eu era um garotinho, seu namoradinho
Amigo de seus pais

E hoje já estou crescido
Sou o seu marido, és minha mulher
Acabou-se a alegria
Brigar todo dia é o que você quer

Se trabalho até mais tarde
E chego cansado em casa
Você diz que estou te traindo
E que por mim não põe a sua mão na brasa

Neste dia certamente
Não como na mesa e olhe lá
Conhecendo sua natureza
Com toda certeza durmo no sofá

Quando chega o fim de semana
Fico em casa para descansar
Uma lista de um metro ou mais
Você traz para me mostrar

E me diz que está faltando o gás, o arroz e o café
O açúcar e o feijão
Sal, pimenta malagueta
Tomate, pepino e também pimentão
Farinha, óleo, sabonete
Bombril, rabanete, jiló e sabão
Banana, abacate, laranja, ovos de granja e até limão
Desodorante e pasta de dente
Uma borracha pra panela de pressão
Um tênis pra Mariazinha
Uma botininha para o Sebastião
Os livros da Antonieta
E uma chupeta para o caçulão
E assim vai seguindo a lista
E o bolso do artista sem nem um tostão",Lista de Compras
Amado Batista,"Esses olhos verdes
Que olham pra mim
Enfeitam seu rosto
E me deixam assim

Mas esses olhos verdes
Que olham pra mim
Amanhã tão distante
Tão longe de mim

Mas esses olhos verdes
Que tanto me atraem
Me sinto contigo
Criança de novo
Menino de mais

Esse olhar tão verde
Que tanto seduz
Não sei se esse olhar
É minha liberdade
Ou a minha cruz

Esses olhos verdes
Que olham pra mim
Enfeitam seu rosto
E me deixam assim

Mas esses olhos verdes
Que olham pra mim
Amanhã tão distante
E tão longe de mim

Mas esses olhos verdes
Que tanto me atraem
Me sinto contigo
Criança de novo
Menino de mais

Esse olhar tão verde
Que tanto seduz
Não sei se esse olhar

Amado Batista,"Triste, sentado aqui nesse jardim
Olho assustado em volta de mim
Só borboletas, borboletas

São borboletas que beijam as flores
Formando nuvens de asas multicores
Sobre minha cabeça

Borboletas, borboletas
Borboletas sobre minha cabeça

Elas aumentam a minha ilusão
E tomam parte em minha solidão
A todo instante

Também me trazem lembrança de alguém
Da borboleta que era meu bem
E que está tão distante

Borboletas, borboletas
Borboletas ela está tão distante

Oh borboletas, parei de voar
Porque agora resolvi contar
Porque sou triste assim

É que alguém que eu tanto queria
Voou pra longe e eu nem mesmo sabia
Que era uma borboleta

Borboletas, borboletas
Borboletas era uma borboleta",Borboletas
Amado Batista,"Eu sou louco por você
Nem preciso lhe falar
Eu te quero mais que tudo
Basta ver no meu olhar
Quero você
O seu beijo me enlouquece
E me faz estremecer
O seu corpo junto ao meu
Me leva nas nuvens de prazer
Amo você

Por isso eu vou voar, voar, voar
Até ao infinito só pra te amar, amar, amar, amar Refrão
Fazer desse amor meu mundo e sonhar, sonhar, amar, amar
Fazer desse amor meu mundo e sonhar
O seu beijo me enlouquece
E me faz estremecer
O seu corpo junto ao meu
Me leva nas nuvens de prazer
Amo você","Amar, Amar"
Amado Batista,"Mais um dia que passa
E o telefone não tocou
Passeiam pela sala
Às marcas desse grande amor
Procuro na lembrança
Qual foi o mal que eu te fiz
Te dei a minha vida
Nem isso te fez feliz

Pra que tentar fugir de mim?
Se eu sempre vou seguir
Na tua direção
Pra que tentar me esquecer?
Pra mim só tem você
E o resto é solidão
Pra quê

Mais um dia que passa
E nada de você voltar
A vida não tem graça
Eu vou morrer de te esperar
Não há lugar no mundo
Onde eu não possa te encontrar
E mesmo nos teus sonhos
Você vai me ouvir gritar

Pra que tentar fugir de mim?
Se eu sempre vou seguir
Na tua direção
Pra que tentar me esquecer?
Pra mim só tem você
E o resto é solidão
Pra quê

(Pra que tentar fugir de mim? Me diz, pra quê! Tentar fugir
Pra que tentar fugir de mim? Olha eu sempre vou te seguir, sempre
Não tente fugir de mim
Me diz pra que tentar fugir
Pra que tentar me esquecer se pra mim só tem você. O resto?
O resto é solidão
Pra que tentar fugir de mim?
Me diz pra que tentar fugir de mim! Me diz pra que!
Se pra mim só tem você
Me diz pra que tentar fugir!
Pra que tentar fugir de mim se mesmo nos teus sonhos você vai me ouvir",Pra Que Fugir de Mim
Amado Batista,"Quando ela passa na rua
É um reboliço geral
Um grita, outro assobia
Ela balança o astral
Eu tenho a felicidade
De ser o dono da flor
Morro de ciúme dela, oh, oh, oh

Um diz oh que gatinha 
Outro diz que amor
Mas sei que ela é só minha, oh, oh, oh

Ela é a minha garota
Voa prá lá gavião
É um troféu que eu ganhei
Nas lutas do coração
Eu tenho a felicidade
De ser o dono da flor
Morro de ciúme dela, oh, oh, oh",Morro de Ciume Dela
Amado Batista,"Me uni a alguém que eu não queria
Forçado pelas leis e a família
Me arrependo tanto, tanto do que fiz
Se houvesse outra vida eu queria

Pra poder viver de novo consciente
Ter a vida um pouco livre, independente
Escolher tudo, tudo o que eu quis
Ser um homem, ser maduro e ser feliz

Este casamento imundo
E sujo
Que acabou de vez
Este sentimento inútil
Não quero
Pra nenhum de vocês

Estou livre, a liberdade chegou
E aquele tempo de tortura terminou
E o sorriso amarelo que eu tinha
Ficou bonito e hoje está de outra cor

E lembrando aquela vida desgraçada
É que prefiro ficar mesmo assim sem nada
Eu não arrisco outra vida de casado
Melhor sozinho do que mal acompanhado

Este casamento imundo
E sujo
Que acabou de vez
Este sentimento inútil
Não quero
Pra nenhum de vocês",Casamento Forçado
Amado Batista,"Só de te ver acho que vale a pena
Ai de você se eu te puser as mãos
Este teu corpo de pele morena
Me envenena de excitação

Eu tô que tô e ninguém me segura
Tô muito louco, tô de alto astral
Você é minha vitamina e cura
Minha mistura de bem e de mal

Meu coração bate mais excitado
Meu corpo vibra de tanto querer
O teu pedaço de amor e pecado
É o bocado que eu quero comer",Vitamina e Cura
Amadou & Mariam,"C'est le salut de l'enfant prodige, celui des Kounta :
Wessou Kounta, celui qui nous a bien reçu.
Le fils de Sidi Yaya et de Bintou.
Celui qui est l'espoir des Maliens,
Lui qui est toujours attaché au Coran, au chapelet et aux hadis.
C'est un homme d'honneur,
C'est ce qui le diffère des autres.",Barika (Tribute)
Amadou & Mariam,"Ne me jugez pas de ce que les mauvaises bouchent vous racontent,
L'amour n'est pas une blague.
Je serai à tes côtés nuits et jours pour te dire de jolis mots,
Des belles phrases d'amour, des conversations confidentielles,
J'irai te chercher pour aller dans les boîtes de nuits, aux concerts, et au cinéma.
Tout ce que tu veux, je veux ça.",Baroni (Chatting)
Amadou & Mariam,"Depuis le matin du bonheur, jusqu'au coucher du soleil,
Tu es là toute la nuit jusqu'au lever du soleil.

Mes amis je vous salue tous, vive les chauffeurs,
Mes amis je vous salue tous, vive les routiers.

Avec vous c'est la joie de vivre, c'est le grand voyage,
De pays en pays, de cité en cité.
La vie et l'envie, vive les routiers.

Mes amis je vous salue tous, vive les chauffeurs,
Mes amis je vous salue tous, vive les routiers.

Depuis le matin du bonheur, jusqu'au coucher du soleil,
La route du Mali est longue, celle de la Guinée, de Lomé, et de la Côte d'Ivoire aussi, mais les chauffeurs parcourent.
Nous saluons les chauffeurs, sans oublier les apprentis chauffeurs.
On ne peut pas conduire un Sotrama,
Une remorque ou un camion sans un apprenti.

Vive les chauffeurs, vive les routiers.
Vive les chauffeurs, vive les routiers.
Vive les chauffeurs, vive les routiers.",Chauffeurs
Amadou & Mariam,"1ère partie
Ne frappez pas l'enfant du chef du village,
N'injuriez pas l'enfant du chef,
Si vous le faites vous aurez des problèmes.
2ème partie
Même si tu te tues pour certains
Ils ne te seront jamais reconnaissants.
J'ai fait des bonnes choses pour eux,
J'ai fait de la viande grasse et du poisson gras pour eux.
En dépit de mes bonnes oeuvres, de mes cadeaux,
Ils ne me sont pas reconnaissants.",Dougou Massa (The Head of the Village)
Amadou & Mariam,"Ne dis pas ton secret au rapporteur.
Le rapporteur n'est pas une bonne personne ; il brise les foyers ; il sépare les amoureux.
Méfiez vous du rapporteur ; les frères et soeurs, les parents, les bons amis.
Il est la cause, de la rupture des bonnes relations,
Il a fermé les bureaux, les entreprises, il a semé la terreur dans le pays.",Fana (The Telltale)
Amadou & Mariam,"Les Maures sont des êtres uniques dans leur genre.
Ils sont différents des autres parce qu'ils sont des hommes de confiance, des hommes d'honneur.

Amadou & Mariam,"Où sont les vrais croyants, les érudits, les pèlerins,

Des enfants déshérités et de tous les Maliens.",Lahilala (There Are No Gods Other Than God)
Amadou & Mariam,"Nous saluons toute la patrie malienne,
Il y a des hommes de parole au Mali.
Il y a des hommes de confiance, des hommes de culture.
Des bons policiers, des bons gendarmes, de bons douaniers,
Il y a de bons soldats au Mali.
Si tu vas à l'étranger et que tu ne rencontres pas de Maliens,
tu ne seras pas heureux.
Si tu viens en France et que tu ne vois pas Fatou Soucko.
C'est que tu ne seras pas heureux. Je salue tous les Maliens.",Mali Denou (Children of Mali)
Amadou & Mariam,"Où sont les Peuls, les hommes et les femmes Peuls,
Ceux qui viennent de Massina, de Konaré, de Mopti, de Ceno et de Fouta.
Les Peuls sont des braves guerriers, ils sont honnêtes.
Ce sont des grands religieux, et des riches éleveurs.
Ils sont les descendants des quatre frères :
Diallo, Diakité, Sidibé, et Sangaré.
Quand ils acceptent une chose,
Ils la font parce qu'ils sont des gens de parole.",Poulo (The Peul People)

Amadou & Mariam,"Dans le village sous les arbres, tous les hommes se rencontraient,
Ils se parlaient, ils discutaient des problèmes de la cité,
Dans le village au clair de la lune, les jeunes filles se rencontraient.
Elles se parlaient et elles chantaient, elles dansaient toute la nuit.

Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les valeurs ont disparu.
Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les coutumes ont disparu.
Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les traditions ont disparu.

Dans le village, sur la grande place, les jeunes gens se rencontraient.
Ils se parlaient, ils discutaient des problèmes de la jeunesse.
Dans les familles on retrouvait le papa et la maman,
Le grand-père, la grand-mère, les grandes sœurs et les petites sœurs,
Les grands frères, les petits frères, les enfants et leurs épouses.

Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les valeurs ont disparu.
Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les coutumes ont disparu.
Les temps ont changé, la vie a changé,
Les traditions ont disparu.

Il est minuit à Tokyo
Il est cinq heures au Mali
Quelle heure est-il au Paradis ?

Nous qui quittons nos pays
Il ne faut pas que les enfants du pays nous oublient
Nous qui sommes dans cette chose
Chose là aucun de nous ne saurait la nommer
Nous qui sommes dans des pays lointains
Il ne faut pas que les enfants du pays nous oublient

C’est au Manhattan fast-food Dakar Sénégal, la grand-mère à l’hôpital
Grand-père tout va bien, moi ici, toi là-bas, le visa au consulat
Numéro 39, j’attends
A l’état civil déjà l’an 2000, déjà 2000 ans au Manhattan fast-food Dakar Sénégal cinéma le Paris,

[Refrain]

Dakar, Bamako, Rio de Janeiro
Où est le problème ? Où est la frontière ? Entre les murs se faufiler dans ascenseur pour le ghetto
Au Manhattan fast-food Dakar Sénégal cinéma le Paris,

Nous qui quittons nos pays
Il ne faut pas que les enfants du pays nous oublient
Nous qui sommes dans cette chose
Chose là aucun de nous ne saurait la nommer
Nous qui sommes dans des pays lointains
Il ne faut pas que les enfants du pays nous oublient

It’s just a jealousy
Everything for you and me

You ready? Here we go

I got my feet, I’m jumping high off the wall
I got my heart, I ain't afraid of the fall
I got my duffel bag that daddy packed for me
I got my ear so I hear when you call
I don’t need eyes just to see you look good
You always did, but they misunderstood

I’m goin’ up and down
And baby round and round
I wanna touch you down the river below
And then I’ll kiss you from your head to your toe
You take me so high up, and then you let me down

Amaia Montero,"Sube la marea en esta habitacion
Pienso en el minuto en que todo cambio
Fue lo mas eterno de la colecion
De todas las fotos que mirando voy

Recordando esta vida junto a ti
Toda la energia que herede de ti
Tu eres mi hero, mi respiracion
Tu que no te rindes nunca, escucha esta cancion

El puerto se durmio esperando a que tu volvieras
Los barcos de papel rompieron a llorar de pena
El mar se revelo why te confio toda su fuerza
Por verte regresar aqui por verte sonreir

Confundida why fragil empece a sentir
Que a esta vida loca le gusta medir
Lazos que se unen para resistir
Golpes bajos que no esperan, tienes que segir

El puerto se durmio esperando a que tu volvieras
Los barcos de papel rompieron a llorar de pena
El mar se revelo why te confio toda su fuerza
Que yo te espero aqui, te doy mi vida por que vuelvas

El puerto se durmio esperando a que tu volvieras
Los barcos de papel volvieron a llorar de pena
El mar se revelo why te confio toda su fuerza
Por verte regresar aqui por verte sonreir

Amaia Montero,"Hoy, repasas las imagenes que van
Del cielo al suelo intentas subrayar
Lo verdaderamente importante

Hoy, intentas que te traiga sin cuidado
Lo que una vez pensaron los demás
Planiando una huida hacía adelante

Tú, la reina de una fiesta bajo el sol
Necesidad abunda en el amor
La única qe baila por los dos

Una canción, qe va directamente al corazón
Qe te hare olvidar qe un día murió
La edad de la inocencia ya anunció
Tus labios oscuros del dolor

Tu espiritu, tu estanqe en una

Caminos qe abrirás, para poder llegar siempre
A lo más valioso qe tendrás a tu libertad

De mirar en tu reflejo why enfrentarte

Armas de doble filo que se creen
Que todo gira entorno a sus mentiras

Que la esperanza puede ser también
La que otra vez me enseñe la salida

Recuerdo el día que te conocí
Quería tu sonrisa para mi

Ya no pretendes por mi
Solo quiero olvidar que un dia de conoci
Pero que hay dias que toda la noche
La paso llorando por ti

Que vivo a plazos por sobrevivir
Algunas veces me cuento
Que necesito un final feliz

Se recogen las cenizas

Que unio el destino de cinco caminos
Why un viejo pintor holandes
Mezcla perfecta de magia secreta

De tardes de lluvia why café
Notas de música hicieron el resto
Vivimos un sueño, ya ves

¿Como olvidarme de tantos momentos
De tantas palabras de amor?
Muertos de risa, vivimos la vida
Why yo ahora canto esta cancion

Que siempre os echaré de menos
Que lo demás son solo cuentos
Siempre sereis mis cuatro ángeles
Que mientras viva, lo recordaré

Que siempre os echaré de menos
Que lo demás son solo cuentos
Siempre sereis mis cuatro ángeles
Que mientras viva, lo recordaré

Durante once años mas
De ese shalalalaralala
Nos acompaño, a recorrer de la mano
Lugares del mapa mundial

Luces, conciertos, vida en aeropuertos
Miradas de complicidad
Pero el hechizo hubo de romperse
El resto la historia dirá

De tantas palabras de amor?
Muertos de risa, vivimos la vida

Mas logo os teus olhos disseram que não

Vi depois, numa rocha, uma cruz
E o teu barco negro dançava na luz
Vi teu braço acenando, entre as velas já soltas
Dizem as velhas da praia, que não voltas

São louca

Eu sei, meu amor

Pois tudo, em meu redor
Me diz qu'estás sempre comigo

Dentro do meu peito, estás sempre comigo

Amália Rodrigues,"Perguntaste-me outro dia
Se eu sabia o que era o fado
Disse-te que não sabia
Tu ficaste admirado
Sem saber o que dizia
Eu menti naquela hora
Disse-te que não sabia
Mas vou-te dizer agora

Almas vencidas
Noites perdidas
Sombras bizarras
Na Mouraria
Canta um rufia
Choram guitarras
Amor ciúme
Cinzas e lume
Dor e pecado
Tudo isto existe
Tudo isto é triste
Tudo isto é fado

Se queres ser o meu senhor
E teres-me sempre a teu lado
Não me fales só de amor
Fala-me também do fado
E o fado é o meu castigo
Só nasceu pra me perder
O fado é tudo o que digo
Mais o que eu não sei dizer",Tudo Isto É Fado [That's the Fado]

Amália Rodrigues,"Foi no domingo passado que passei
À casa onde vivia a Mariquinhas
Mas está tudo tão mudado
Que não vi em nenhum lado
As tais janelas que tinham tabuinhas

Do rés-do-chão ao telhado
Não vi nada, nada, nada
Que pudesse recordar-me a Mariquinhas
E há um vidro pregado e azulado
Onde havia as tabuinhas

Entrei e onde era a sala agora está
À secretária um sujeito que é lingrinhas
Mas não vi colchas com barra
Nem viola, nem guitarra
Nem espreitadelas furtivas das vizinhas

O tempo cravou a garra
Na alma daquela casa
Onde as vezes petiscávamos sardinhas
Quando em noites de guitarra e de farra
Estava alegre a Mariquinhas

As janelas tão garridas que ficavam
Com cortinados de chita às pintinhas
Perderam de todo a graça
Porque é hoje uma vidraça
Com cercadura de lata às voltinhas

E lá pra dentro quem passa
Hoje é pra ir aos penhores
Entregar ao usurário umas coisinhas
Pois chega a esta desgraça toda a graça
Da casa da Mariquinhas

Pra terem feito da casa o que fizeram
Melhor fora que a mandassem pras alminhas
Pois ser casa de penhores
O que foi viveiro d'amores
É ideia que não cabe cá nas minhas

Recordações do calor
E das saudades o gosto
Que eu vou procurar esquecer
Numas ginginhas
Pois dar de beber à dor é o melhor
Já dizia a Mariquinhas
Pois dar de beber à dor é o melhor
Já dizia a Mariquinhas",Vou Dar de Beber a Dor

Do silêncio faço um grito
O corpo todo me dói
Deixai-me chorar um pouco.

De sombra a sombra
Há um Céu, tão recolhido,
De sombra a sombra
Já lhe perdi o sentido.

Ao céu!
Aqui me falta a luz
Aqui me falta uma estrela
Chora-se mais 
Quando se vive atrás dela.

E eu,
A quem o sol esqueceu
Sou a que o mundo perdeu 
Só choro agora 
Que quem morre já não chora.

Solidão!
Que nem mesmo essa é inteira,
Há sempre uma companheira
Uma profunda amargura.

Ai, solidão
Quem fora escorpião
Ai! solidão
E se mordera a cabeça!

Adeus
Já fui para além da vida
Do que já fui tenho sede

Encostada a uma parede.

É que faz ganhar o céu?

Foi Deus, que deu luz aos olhos
Perfumou as rosas, deu ouro ao sol e prata ao luar
Foi Deus que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar
E pôs as estrelas no céu
E fez o espaço sem fim
Deu luto as andorinhas
Ai deu-me esta voz a mim

Se canto, não sei porque canto
Misto de ternura, saudade, ventura e talvez de amor
Mas sei que cantando
Sinto o mesmo quando, se tem um desgosto
E o pranto no rosto nos deixa melhor
Foi Deus, que deu voz ao vento
Luz ao firmamento
E deu o azul nas ondas do mar
Ai foi Deus, que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar

Warum mach' ich das? Warum surf' ich nicht?
Warum sitz' ich hier und schwitze bis in jede Ritze?

Okay, ich klapp' den Laptop zu
Ich mach' Feierabend jetzt kommst du!

Ich bin kein Maler, doch ich mach' blau

Komm, sei doch ehrlich!
Du bist wie ich, du hast auch keinen Bock
Also lass gehen!
Mach Stopp!

Hey! Guck, der Himmel ist blau
Komm, das machen wir auch
Mann, dein Laptop ist grau
Klapp ihn zu! Mach ihn aus!
Guck, der Himmel ist blau

Amanda,"Es ist gut, es zu klären nach Ewigkeiten Hirngeficke
Nur wir beide an 'nem Tisch bis das hingekriegt ist
Nehmen uns 'n bisschen Zeit, ist doch eh wie früher
Sitzen gegenüber und reden drüber
Ich hab' alles gut geplant, ich hab'n Manuskript
Sprenge alle Ketten ab, die's noch an uns gibt
Schnauze voll von Gedanke, die mich anfassen
Sie sollen mich kalt lassen, die Altlasten
Du gewinnst 'n bisschen Zeit mit Begrüßungsfloskeln
Laberst über dies und das, was keine Mühe kostet
Ich hör' dir solang zu bis du deinen letzten Scherz machst
Und ich mir' Herz fass', dann werden wir ernsthaft
Ich räusper' Richtung Uhr, aber langsam geht die Zeit rum
Dann versuch' ich was zu sagen, doch ich bleib' stumm
Taste mit meinen Fingern panisch mitten im Gesicht
Ich hab's nicht mitgekriegt, man ich find' meine Lippen nicht

Und ich weiß es ist erst vorbei
Wenn alles ausgesprochen, ausgebrochen
Ausgeknockt und frei ist
Ich weiß es ist erst vorbei
Wenn's vorbei ist

Der erste Schock vergeht, ich stell fest, ich bin mundlos
Blanke Haut, wo mal Lippen waren, ich bin mundtot
Zieh' den Atem durch die Nase, mir wird zu klar
Alles zu da, wo mal 'n Mund war
Ich guck' zu dir rüber, seh' dass du entsetzt bist
Mit Tränen in den Augen sagst du „Gott, ist das schrecklich
Was ist los mit dir? Ich glaub', du musst ins Krankenhaus!“
Doch ich halt' es aus und ich halt' dich auf
Ich such' 'nen andern Weg, muss doch geh'n, egal wie
Schau' dich lang an, versuch' Telepathie
Ich gebe alles, was ich hab', versuch' es redlich
Doch vergeblich, du verstehst nicht
Mein letzter Ausweg, Hand und Fuß, Zeichensprache
Keine Regung in den Gliedern, sie sind eingeschlafen
So sitz' ich hilflos auf'm Stuhl wie festgenäht
Weil's echt nicht geht, lass' ich dich am besten gehen

Und ich weiß es ist erst vorbei
Wenn alles ausgesprochen, ausgebrochen
Ausgeknockt und frei ist
Ich weiß es ist erst vorbei
Wenn's vorbei ist

(There's a message for you)
(There's a message for you)
(There's a message for you)

Nachdem du weg bist, alles gut, beinah' normal
Mund, Arme, Beine, alles da, mit einem Mal
Alles was ich plante, könnt' ich wieder sagen
Mit Worten erschlagen, die vielen Fragen
Doch meine Stimme bringt nix ohne deine Ohren
Die grauen Wolken ziehen nicht weg eingefroren
Es führt nur eine Tür raus und die ist fast schon zu
Ich muss nur wissen, der Schlüssel, das bist du

Und ich weiß es ist erst vorbei
Wenn alles ausgesprochen, ausgebrochen
Ausgeknockt und frei ist
Ich weiß es ist erst vorbei, wenn's vorbei ist
Und ich weiß es ist erst vorbei

In the summer time
Would I choose you
Or the friends of mine

I had seen you
Looking at me on our way
To school and 
I watched you too
You were looking kinda cute
With your bangles
And your eyes
I just couldn't help myself
I walked up to you
You said hey girl, what's up
We went dating
You took me to the movies
And you held my hand
On our way home 
You gave me a kiss & a beeper
Then you smiled
You said now I can be sure
That I'll reach my girl
Cause you rock my world

Amanda Blank,"DJ, play that song a little louder
I gotta, gotta get him outta my head
Gotta dance the pain away
Can't go to sleep just yet

My baby, he left me high and dry
Can't be the man for me
Said he can't tell me why
He told me that he loves me
But he's gotta be alone
He doesn't need me anymore
Wants to do it on his own
He said he doesn't wanna run
But we hold each other back
I love him so hard, 
I would fall off track

DJ, play that song a little louder
I gotta, gotta get him outta my head
Gotta dance the pain away
Can't go to sleep just yet
DJ, can't you play a little harder?
I gotta, gotta get farther outta the zone
I need the beat for release
I can't get it on my own

How could he say that
He loves me unconditionally, 
But still put so many rules
And restrictions on me?
He told me, ""No one's gonna love you
As much as I do, 
But I can't be the man
That you need me to.""
He just couldn't hold my hand, 
But he couldn't let me go
Was afraid that I found someone
That loves me more
So he keeps me in his trap
While he walks out the gate
He knows he's gonna come back, 
He knows that it's too late

Save me, save me, 
This boy is trying to break me
I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
I need someone to take me

Amanda Blank,"When I'm alone in my room
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And at the back of my mind I hear my conscious call
Telling me I need a boy who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games that I had played with many hearts
And I'm not sayin' no names.
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself when am I gonna learn?
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playin' make believe, pretending that I'm true, 
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you.

Saying no more, kissing you on the ear, 
Whispering 'I love you and I'll always be here, 
Although I always reminisce, I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around inside my soul
Because my soul is cold, one half of me deserves to be this way
Until I'm old, but the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love, I need love
I'm a lady
I need love, I need love
I'm a lady

I had a dream that you and I were both 16
Holding hands after school, 
We didn't care who would see

You'd tell me that I was pretty and that you'd love me for life
Take care of me forever 'cause you'd make me a wife
When the girls call me up and try to mess with my head
Tell 'em all that if I left you, you'd be better off dead
'Cause you'll never love another, they just don't understand
That your life would be over if I found another mate, 
You call me up on the phone, we were talking til we fell asleep, 
Without you I'd rather be in hell
Life just wouldn't be as fun, it wouldn't be the same, 
I wanna stay with you forever and even take your last name
'Cause there's no one in my life that makes me feel as good as you
The way we cuddle on the couch and share the secrets that we do
With all the little jokes that no one else could ever know and the part of me
That you can see 'cause you're the one I show
I know we gotta make it work, 'cause baby you're the man for me
Without you by my side my world would be incomplete
And if you ever leave me lonely, boy my heart would be crushed
Right now I know that boy

I need love, I need love
I'm a lady
I need love, I need love
I'm a lady
I need love, I'm a lady",A  Love Song
Amanda Blank,"[Chorus]
My ladies who got their own cash
Know how to swing their hips fast

The girl in the back swallows the daily thrill 
She wraps her ache twice & hopes the world stands still 


And oh, this heavy load 
You can lay down with me 
And oh, this heavy load 
You can lay down with me 

Strange and strange and stranger still 
She prays and stays and grabs for one more year 
White smoke for the new pope says there's nothing to fear 


Cold and cold and colder still 
She looks out the window, straight to Beacon Hill 
And she will lie to purify this fear she can't distill 

And oh, this heavy load 
You can lay down with me

Speak the words that I can't read 
You're making my heart bleed 


Oh, I remember well 
As far as I can tell 
I buried it with that penny jar 
In the backyard sand 


And now it's gone the perfect plan 
To win back her heart again
Now she's in another band 
But so am I

Speak the words that I can't read 
You're making my heart bleed 


Shovel's not my favorite word 
But I'm not afraid to get down in the dirt 
Dig deeper and deeper over and over again 
She fly's like a wedding dove 
She pushes, but never shoves 
I'd do it, she did it 
I do it out of love

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind

His wife remembers well the man she knew.
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue,
She's wasted years. 
No time for tears
 
'cause there's another chance, and someday soon
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
It's three a.m. and Virgil's passed out on the sofa,
a fifth of Jim Beam on the floor.
She's packed a bag.  
She slips the keys out of his pocket.
She's careful not to slam the door. 
And as she drives, she rubs her rosary.
She's never been so all alone. She's never felt so free.
She got miles to go, blind faith and hope
 
'cause there's an other chance, and someday soon 
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
As the rain falls down upon the interstate,
any doubts she had are all but washed away.

Amanda Marshall,"We've done our cold time, you and I 
Fought off the raging of this northern sky 
And heaven knows I want to compare the ocean to your eyes

Doin' hard time, day to day 
Huddled beneath this winter sun all frozen grey 
You lose your freedom while you watch the season slip away 
But not today 

Livin' in the darkness, baby 
Comin' all undone 
Been a cruel December, now we're prayin' for the sun 
By the time the storm rolls in, we could be long gone 
Baby, let's get lost til the days get long 
Just you and I 
Frost on the outside brings a chill within 
Seems like we hide our hearts away when the days get dim

Voices in your head say stay 
I can hear them too 
But those doubts'll fade away 
In our room with a view 
There's a sweet breeze blowin' somewhere, baby 
All you gotta do 
Is tell me that it's time to go 
And I'll be there with you

So many heartaches wide
And I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side
I've got to be honest
I've got my doubts
These tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love?
Baby, I'll tell you something
To help us through this long, dark night

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
But trust me, baby...this is love.
Love isn't easy
I'm torn, I confess
When a heart is uncertain
It's bound to second guess
This love won't forsake us
So dry your tears I promise you

I'm here for you baby
There's nothing I want more
Our day is coming
And we'll reach that peaceful shore

But now I know you're never coming back

I wish I could stop

Must have been waiting for some one, baby 
Now I can see, I was waiting for you

I'd give up my sight just to see you
I'd beg I would borrow and steal
I'd cut off my hands just to touch you
And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel

There's nothing I wouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't want to be me

Once in a lifetime
Destiny finds you and blows you away
Spins you in circles

Just to lay your heart open wide
If you want to get to heaven
Then you gotta take the ride

Wherever you are
Convince me
I'm safe in your arms

Teach me to fly
And don't let me fall

Somebody told me
Love makes you stupid
Makes you go crazy
Makes you go blind
Comes uninvited
And leaves when it wants to
Calls you at midnight and ties up your line
But it's oh so sweet when it's right (There's nothin' better)
And you swear you won't but you might (You're gonna try)
Gotta fumble in the dark if you want to see the light

And when it's all said and done
It's just the same for everyone

Flying out of your hands

And it's oh so hard to explain (We don't know nothin')
And your heart gets hold of your brain (But still we try)
Better batten down the hatches baby
Here we go again

Wherever you are

He lives down in old Albuquerque
We used to watch the sun coming up together
But he was hungry then
And he got restless
I heard he took a wife

With the Santa Fe horizon
Calling out my name

But the thought of catching up
With a ghost I left behind

But I know I've got to try
'Cause we said a lot of things baby
But we never said goodbye

I drove a thousand miles
Chasing a memory
But all the pieces of what used to be have scattered
And all the little things
That used to mean so much
I look around me now and see that they don't matter

And every day I swear that I'll be strong
But there's a bond between us that I can't deny

But still I know 

And in your eyes I see the reason 
In your smile I see the road that takes me home 
In my heart I know the answer 
That all the things I looked so hard to find 
Were right here all along...right here all along

I used to know that the world was round
I relied on the speed of sound
Gravity used to hold me down
But now, what can I believe in?
You were the constant one true thing
You made me sure of everything
I can't believe this is happening
You and your brand new beau ( I think it's time to go)

I was under the distinct impression
That we were swinging in the same direction
But you've got a predilection
This truth is stranger than fiction
The way you touched me, I had no suspicions
But evidently, you've no inhibitions
Your body took you on a covert mission
Why am I the last to know?

I walked in it was just around midnight
It was snowing, so they canceled my flight
Two empty glasses in the dim candlelight
I heard you mention my name
And then I heard another voice that shocked me
He was saying ""is the front door locked?""
He saw my face and you tried to block me

Amanda Marshall,"Let me tell you about Colleen
My best friend since I was three
She always had a taste for dangerous things
Her scandalous tongue was extreme
I was always the one left holding the bag
Smiling and covering her tracks
Best friends, they always do that

She was the first to smoke a cigarette
She once let me watch her make love
It was the kind of balance made by kings
She took it all, but left me some
I guess I always thought she'd have my back
But it didn't work out like that
The moment I laid eyes on Jack

[Chorus]
It was my time, it was my space
It was the bright red he brought to my face
Every underdog has their day
Sorry it hurts
But Colleen I saw him first

It all happened on a Thursday
He backed his car right into mine (crash, boom, bang!)
""There are no accidents"", my mother told me once
My heart agreed with her this time
Colleen jumped out of the car, screaming
""What have you done?!""
Jack offered apologies
I just got weak in the knees

[Chorus]

The minute that your in it
You know there's no turning back
Like me and my Jack
A funny thing
To feel the weight of the pendulum swing
When it starts to swing

Colleen armed with charm and body
Still couldn't take away my man
Last I heard, She was in rehab
I guess that scale got outta hand
Covered from head to toe in colored tattoos
Searching for higher views
Hungry for I love you's

Amanda Marshall,"I like salsa with my pancakes, baby
I like to vacuum when I'm in the nude
I'll watch the weather channel for no reason
I like it, baby, just like I like you
Sometimes the love you get is free from logic
Sometimes it happens when it least expect it
Sometimes I wonder why the world's gone crazy
But I like never knowing what comes next
Cause I found you 
Without out even trying
Or lifting a finger
And then you were here

[Chorus]
Such a strange thing 
We think we are in control
We always know
Until we don't
Funny how the world can spin so fast
And we don't crash
We just get dizzy

If I could, Maybe I'd build a rocket
So you and I could make love on the moon
And get perspective on a world gone crazy 
Get understanding about you and me
I used to pully my hair out and worry baby,
That I would die before I found true love
But then the moment that my heart stopped searching
A spirit brought you here and the universe
Called my bluff
The best things happen
When you don't try
Or wish on an eyelash
Just open your heart
To a strange thing

[Chorus]

Fasten your seat belt, it's always a bumpy ride
Check out the scenery
Don't sweat the details
Don't choke on your pride
Don't fight the changing tide

We're all just flying blind

Though who I am to you is not a lie
I don't have to volunteer and say
That I was born a particular way
I got no uniform
I'm camouflaged in any light
Obviously you can't tell
I'm a double agent on my mama's side

And what do you hear when you hear me?
I hear you crank up Jay-Z, it's your favorite jam
And you talk with your hands like an MC
Betcha never get stopped by the police
You never ask me about me (no no no)
About how I feel when you call all your white friends
""Homeboy"" and ""nigga"" and ""homie""
Oh, please
It hurts me
And you don't see

What you don't know about me is

I am invisible (I am)
Am I responsible (I am)
I'm in between it all

I am part of no plan
My honesty is contraband
My blood is thicker than any mans

What do you like when you like me? (Don't you like me?)
I am ingredients far beyond flour and molecules
Calluses, family jewels
I'm no fool
We went to the same school
Some of your best friends are just like me
But when they're not around you make jokes and conspire
The fire gets higher and I feel the heat
Rising underneath

Now, now who drinks a cherry coke
Maybe you notice
I see that bead of sweat dancing on your cheek
Your words are like a cheap champagne,
I get the point, but it's much too sweet

I'm so tired of the dance,
This carousel of superficial conversation
Gets me nowhere

Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,

Or the taxi driver who just dropped you off,
Or the, or the classmate that you ignore.

Don't assume everything on the surface is what you see,
'Cause that classmate just lost her mother,
And that taxi driver's got a Ph-d.

Cause some things, you just don't wanna know
So don't try to read my palm, or predict what we'll become
Cause the real thing just needs space to grow
I do believe in us, but
But you can't fast forward through
The kinda deep only time can prove
What's the rush, baby, trust what faith can do

[Chorus]
Let's not play the game of love with scared money,
Let's not say what we'll become
Let's just roll the dice and throw away the cards
You don't have to push so hard
Cause the gypsy in me needs to roam your heart
(I need to roam ya, I need to roam ya, I need to roam, your heart)

You know I would live my life
Out a suitcase every night
Before I'd let you tie me down
So just lean back and relax
Feel your bare feet in the grass
And let love run on open ground

I do believe in you, but
You can't tell a bird not to fly
You can't tell the sun when to shine
What's the rush, baby, we can take out time

For each thread to support the bigger picture and the larger purpose

Hold my hand
Storm clouds are circling
Hungry for barren land
It's eerie
Yeah, it's much too still
Can you feel my body spin?
Feel it, yeah, I know you will
Drama makes me comfortable
Chaos calms me down
Everything is clear when you're inside the tornado
Everything is quiet in the eye of the storm
I will give you wings if you hang onto my halo
Nothing is stable
Inside the tornado

This wind is blowing madness
But there's a method to this
This is the cure for sadness
Force is centrifugal
It keeps you in
It's dark and rain is falling
Longing to touch your skin
Close your eyes and feel the power
This is so sublime

Everything is quiet in the eye of the storm

Amanda Marshall,"I've been thinking about us
I've been turning round and round
Even buried my head in the sand of the holy land
That claims my name
And I'm not a liar
When I say that I love you
I just take one look in those ruby eyes
And I see the light

So I raise my hand
Love is my witness
And I am guilty for a lot of things I've done
But if I'm the holy daughter, your the holy son
And my heart says
Love is my witness

Don't run away
Don't let 'em plant that seed in ya
Emotions are deeper than the empty stares
That disapprove
Life is a diamond
At first surrounded by the coal
It take more than words
More than words to make us whole

And watch the parade
Take funny pictures, eat jambalaya, and drink lemonade
And when the day is finally over
And we stumble home
Before we sleep
Baby, marry me

I want to drive
Until we get lost
Lie in a field staring up at the sky
While you point out the Southern Cross
Somehow I know
Without asking why
That you love me more in a minute
Than anyone could in a lifetime
Dancing in the parking lot
While the band plays inside
Sweep me off my feet

Readin' from the Good Book
And I don't want no fancy dress
Ain't no ceremony for the vows that I took
From the moment I met you
I have been blessed

So let's make a toast
And drink up the wine
Here's to you lying here next to me
Until the end of time
Wherever you are
I want to be
And anything that means anything to ya
Means everything to me

What planet do you come from?
Is their TV, email, or a telephone line?
Do you have friends?
Or family to warn you when there's trouble?
Cause up to now you're deaf, dumb and blind

This is my line in the sand
This is my last open hand

Can't you read?
Cause it's written all over my face
That I love you

Says ""I love you""
It's in red magic marker

But it won't go away

Are you gay?
That's cool, just tell me
It's okay, I'll feel stupid but then we can hang out
But if you're straight
Then what the fuck's the matter?
Cause my deepest intuition tells me there is no doubt

This is my line in the sand
This is where I take a stand

I try to wash it off
But it won't go away
Won't go away, no

He's in her row two seats behind
Ten years old, the torture never ends
One day at recess she pulls him aside
She's taking his hand, She looks in his eyes
She's steppin' in close, So no one can hear
Then she whispers in his ear
She says

Tell me all your secrets 
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars

Time flies to graduation
They leave the party
Take a drive
She keeps asking where they're going
He laughs and looks away, it's a surprise
Out on the playground, right where they stood
Down on one knee he asks if she would
He gives her the ring, She starts to cry
It's the first night of the rest of their lives

Tell me all your secrets 
And I won't tell anybody

It kills him to let her go 
But she wants to fly
So he gives her the wings
And tells her goodbye

Track 11 on the Philadelphia line
He was early now he's waiting
And the people rush the doors
Some are laughing 
Some are crying
Up on the platform
He scans the crowd
He doesn't see her
He looks all around
But damned disappointment hangs like a shroud 
Suddenly a voice rings out
Says

And I won't tell anybody

I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips

To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.

Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""

Some say, ""Love, it is a a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love, it is a flower
And you it's only seed""

It's the heart that fears breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Far beneath the bitter snows
Life's the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

En la ventana un cartel de neón
Cae la lluvia sobre Nueva York, fría

Que alucinante es volverte a encontrar
Luego de un año el mismo lugar
Y de repente me alegro de estar, viva

No sé por qué será
Tal vez cuestión de piel o la lluvia
Que como un mar de cristal
Cae en el parque central

No fuiste tú ni yo quien lo planeó
Fue Nueva York o el destino
Lo decidió así y nos unió otra vez

Sobre la alfombra quedó mi café, frio

Parece ayer, tu piel, mi piel
La misma sed y la lluvia
Que ha comenzado a tocar
Música el ventanal

No fuiste tú ni yo quien lo planeó
Fue Nueva York o el destino
Lo decidió así y nos unió otra vez

",Lluvia en Nueva York
Amanda Miguel,"Cuando pienso
Que este mundo a mi alrededor
Existí una vez
Solo en tu imaginación

Cada vez que levanto los ojos al cielo azul
Entre tantas estrellas bañándome con su luz
Que pequeña soy

Cuando entiendo
Que vivimos en la eternidad
Porque ne realidad
No hay principio ni final

Esas cosas que todos deseamos
Alguna vez
Esos sueños de gloria riquezas y de poder
Que pequeño soy

Y regreso a ti
Porque veo por fin
Que no hay otro camino

Tu eres la vida
La semilla el fruto y la flor
La chispa divina
Que encendí en las tinieblas al sol
El espíritu de la creación
El rostro del amor

Cuantas veces nos asesinamos sin razón
Por la pequeñez
De una idea o de un color
Cuanta sangre inocente costa nuestra estupidez
Cuantas lagrimas hemos llorado hasta entender
Cual es la lección

Y volvemos por fin 
Porque llevan a ti todos nuestros caminos

Tu eres la vida
Manantial
Que no se agota jamas
La luz encendida 
Que nos guía en el camino a la paz
La esperanza de un futuro mejor
El rostro del amor

Tu eres la vida
La semilla el fruto y la flor
La chispa divina
Que encendí en las tinieblas al sol
El espíritu de la creación

Amanda Miguel,"Yo se que a tus amigos vas diciendo 
Que ya no te importa más de mi
Que al tiempo al lado mio 
Es un capitulo concluido sin final feliz
Yo se que a esa mujer a quien le das 
Lo que jamas quisiste darme a mi
Se atreve a comentar que yo no tengo dignidad 
Que me tiene piedad
Ah ah ah ah

Tal vez yo deba resignarme why no llamarte más
Tal vez yo deba respetar why no rogarte más
Tal vez deba dejar con toda dignidad
Que vivas un romance más

No se si te das cuenta con la estupida que estás
Yo se que no podrá quererte como yo
Asi no te amará jamás",Asi No Te Amara Jamas
Amanda Miguel,"Hubo una vez un pais de miel
Con tejados color bermelln
Donde yo era reina y el era el rey
En un reino de cuentos de amor

Mi magico castillo en el aire
Brillaba transparente bajo el sol

Hubo luego aquella tormenta cruel
Y el castillo del aire cay
A la luz de un rayo se abri a mis pies
El abismo de su corazn

Entonces pude verlo tal cual era
Y lo que descubr me destroz

Mi rey era un mounstro de piedra
Con el corazn de piedra
Pag por mi amor con piedras
Rompi mi ilusin con piedras

Yo fui una vez esa ingenua fiel
Que este cuento crey realidad
Y pague tan caro mi estupidz
Que no quiero atreverme a soar

No quiero mas castillos en el aire
Ni reyes que lastiman sin piedad

Con el corazn de piedra
Su amor siempre fue mentira

Yo voy a raptarte voy a seducirte

Amanda Miguel,"Se paró, mi mundo de repente se paró
Se paró, como un reloj sin cuerda la pasión
Cuando yo sentí que no sentías

Al hacernos el amor
Y a tus labios asomaba una mentira
Todo allí se paró

Se paró la música que hacíamos tú y yo
(Tan nuestra)
Y murió la fe que yo tenía en el amor
(Eterno)

Se paró, helado de dolor, mi corazón oh uh
Se paró y yo no sé qué hacer con este amor
Mi mundo de repente se paró

Se paró el diálogo que había entre los dos
Todos nuestros sueños se murieron
Sin ninguna explicación y a pesar que pese
A todo yo te quiero, todo en mí se terminó

Se paró la música que hacíamos tú y yo, tan nuestra
Se calló, le puso una mordaza tu traición infame
Se paró como un reloj sin cuerda la pasión
Se paró y yo no sé qué hacer con este amor

Ahora que mi vida se paró

Yo me tomaba un café en el mostrador
Vi que dejo una moneda y su mano temblaba
Pero a pesar del murmullo mi voz escuche
Luego encendí un cigarrillo para que me viera
Ella seguía escuchando en el disco mi voz
Quise acercarme a su lado para sonreirle
Vi que lloraba bajito por esa canción

Por que llorar el amor es así como viene se marcha
No hay solución solo queda el recuerdo y alguna canción
Por que llorar el amor es así como se viene se marcha
Pronto veras que lo que te a pasado se habrá de olvidar

Pero al volverse de pronto me reconoció
Y fui acercándome lento por entre la gente
Vi que sus ojos hablaban de la soledad
Y con dulzura le dije que a todos nos pasa

No la compuse para que llorara una niña

Tanto que esperó el momento de decírselo,

Amanda Palmer,"I walk down my street at night
The city lights are strange and violent
I am comforted by the approaching sounds of trucks and sirens 
Even though the world's so bad
These men rush out to help the dying
And though I am no use to them
I do my part by simply smiling

The ghetto boys are catcalling me
As I pull my keys from my pocket
I wonder if this method of courtship
Has ever been effective
Has any girl in history said
Sure, you seem so nice, let's get it on
Still, I always shock them when I answer
Hi my name's Amanda
And I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand 
And even if I went with you I'm not the girl you think I am
And I'm not gonna match you
'Cause I'll lose my voice completely yeah
I'm just gonna watch you
'Cause I'm not the one that's crazy
Yeah

I have wasted years of my life
Agonizing up at the fires
It started when I thought that to be strong you must be flame retardant
And now to dress the wounds cause into question
How authentic they are
There is always someone criticizing me 
She just likes paying hospital
Lying in my bed
I remember what you said
There's no such thing as accidents

But you've got the headstone all ready
All craved up and pretty
Your sick satisfaction
Those his and hers matching
The daisies all push up'n
Pairs to the horizons
Your hands full of ketchup
It's nice that you're trying
The headstone's all ready
All carved up and pretty
Your sick satisfaction 
Those his and hers matching
The daises all push up'n
Pairs to the horizons
Your eyes full of ketchup
It's nice that you're trying

And I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand

Cause I'm not the one that's crazy
Yeah 
I'm not the one that's crazy
Yeah…

As I wake up to a cough 
The blaze consumed the block
But poetically stopped at my apartment
And my housemates are all sleeping soundly
And nobody deserves to die
But you were awful adamant
That if I didn't love you
Then you have just one alternative 

And I may be romantic
And I may risk my life for it
But I ain't gonna die for you
You know I ain't no Juliet
And I'm not gonna watch you wanna burn yourself out baby
No I'm not gonna stop you
'Cause I'm not the one that's crazy, yeah 
I'm not the one that's crazy, yeah
I'm not the one that's crazy…",Ampersand
Amanda Palmer,"Blake says no one ever really loved him 
They just faked it to get money from the government 
And Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust 
He shakes his pretty head 
But darling, trust me, trust me 
He's no valentine 
Though he said he would be mine 
His heart is in Alaska all the time 

Blake stays underwater for the most part 
He collects loose change for All Tomorrow's Parties 
And when Blake dates girls with tattoos of the pyramids 
He breaks their hearts 
By saying it's not permanent 
But in his velvet mind 
He believes with all his might 
We'll all go to Alaska when we die 

Blake makes friends but only for a minute 
He prefers the things he orders from the internet 
And Blake's been having trouble with his head again 
He takes his pills 
But never takes his medicine 
Like Candy in his prime 
He likes his shirts to shine 
And when it's two o'clock it feels like nine 

Blake says he is sorry he got through to me 
If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine 
Blake says it looks like acid rain today 
He takes the fish inside 
He's very kind that way 
But just like Caroline 
He doesn't seem to mind

And I must've been thirsty
'Cause I drank it so quickly

There was somebody waiting
And it isn't my fault
That the barbarian raped me

I brought along my best friend
Melissa Mahoney
Who had once been molested

And she knew how to get there
She knew all the nurses
They were all really friendly
But the test came out positive

Uh-oh

I've seen better days but I don't care
I just sent a letter in the mail

When I got my abortion
I brought along my boyfriend
We got there an hour
Before the appointment

And outside the building
There were all these annoying
Fundamentalist Christians
We tried to ignore them

Oh-oh

I've had better days but I don't care
Oasis got my letter in the mail

When vacation was over
The word was all over
That I was a crack whore
Melissa had told them

And so now were not talking
Except we have tickets
To see blur in October
And I think were still going

Oh-oh

I've seen better days but I don't care
Oh I just got a letter in the mail

Oasis sent a photograph
Its autographed and everything
Melissa's gonna wet herself
I swear",Oasis
Amanda Palmer,"Oh what a noble distinguished collection of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again no we'll wait no we promise we'll wait
June makes these excellent sewing machines out of common industrial waste
She spends a few months at a time on the couch 
But she's safe she wears shades she wears shades
Oh but no one can stare at the wall as good as you my baby doll

You're only human after all
And you're learning that just 'cause they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call
They made the comment and just
But you've got the needle I guess that's the point of it all

Maybe a week in the tropics would help to remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on the deck with a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple days later we came back and you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet eyes fixed on the spot where the dryer had been
Oh yes no one can stare at the wall as good as you my baby doll
And you're racist for playing along 
You're almost human after all
Why on earth would I keep you locked up in here where you so love the fall
Well the patterns laid out on the bed
With hundreds of colors of thread
But you've got the needle I guess that's the point in the end

It's better to waste your life watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
And to put yourself in and turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
And while you were sleeping some men came around and said they had some dementions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about but they sure a mess of your face
But still no one can stare at the wall as good as you my baby doll
And you're racist for coming along you're almost human even now
And just cause they call themself experts doesn't mean that they'll call

Amanda Palmer,"My friend has problems with winter and autumn.
They give him prescriptions and shine bright lights on him.
They say it's genetic, they say he can't help it, they say you can catch it - but sometimes you're born with it.
My friend despite he gets shakes in the night and they say that there's no way that they could have caught it in time takes his toll on him.
It is traditional.
It is inherited.
Predispositional
Day I've been wondering what is inside of me, who can I blame for it?
I say it runs in the family

My friend's depressed she's a wreck, she's a mess.
They've done all sorts of tests & they guess it has something to do with her grandmother's grandfather's grandmother saving war soldiers who probably infected her.
My friend has validation in some allergies that she dates back to the 17th century.
Somehow she manages in her misery.
Strips in the city and shows all her best tricks.
I mean well, I'm well well I mean I'm in hell well I still have my health at least that's what they tell me.
If wellness is this what in hells name is sickness?
But business is business and business runs in the family.

Mary have mercy now look what I've done but don't blame 'cause I can't help where I come from.
Running is something that we've always done well and mostly I can't even tell what I'm running from.
Run from their pity, from responsibility.
Run from the country and run from the city.
I can run from the law, I can run from myself.
I can run from my life, I can run into debt.
I can run from it all, I can run til I'm gone.
I can run for the office and run for my cause.
I can run using every last ounce of energy.
I cannot, I cannot, I cannot run from my family.

They're hiding inside of me.
Don't change my life.
Help me if you might but don't tell my family.

Just as I reached into my pocket to find it empty of any ?????
I saw two broken twigs on the ground,
Shapped like the greek letters F & S,

F and S, helium, F & S,
These are the chemical symbols for Iron & sulfur
It was a sign I'm sure for me to make gold from these two elements,
I've been working all day over these hellish flames.

Locked in his bedroom
He saw the world
A web of answers
And cumshot girls

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

Don't bother blaming
His games and guns
He's only playing
And boys just want to have fun

He picked a soundtrack
And packed his bag
He hung his walkman
Around his neck

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

It's so simple
The way they fall
No cry, no whimper
No sound at all

Amanda Palmer,"What's the use of wondering if he's good or if he's bad
Or if you like the way he wears his hat
Ooh what's the use of wondering if he's good or if he's bad
He's your fella and you love him 
That's all there is to that

Common sense may tell you that the neding will be sad
And now's the time to break and run away
But what's the use of wondering if the ending will be sad
He's your fella and you love him there's nothing more to say

Something made him the way that he is 
Whether he is fast or true
And something gave him the things that are his
One of those things is you

So when he wants your kisses
You'll give them to the lad
And anywhere he leads you you will look
And anytime he needs you 
You'll go running there like mad

You're his girl
And he's your fella

Amanda Palmer,"I could do the dishes while talking on the phone
I could ask you for an answer but you want to be alone
I can never do the dishes a single dish at a time
It's too much of a commitment so I close my eyes and fire

I could calamine your insides
I could wind them all around me I could
Tiptoe on a tightrope made of fear and looking down see
All the people do they see me I can wave or
I can carry all the silverware I'm holding that is
Keeping me steady

Or I could go to Australia
And carry a bowie knife
And wear my hair like Hepburn parted on the side 
And learn card tricks and buy
Everyone drinks and take boxing and write
Songs about my bowie knife

I could do these dishes I could try
To do these dishes
Time to decide

I could make a cake
My kitchen is small but I could clear the space
I could write my name
'Cause practice makes perfect yes that's what they say
I could rearrange my room and draw a bath and wash my wolf suit

I could make a button out of plaster
That said finished I could nail it in my closet
To the right side of the light switch
I could walk down to a restaurant and try drinking to forget it
But then come home less afraid and then press it and press it

Or I could go to Australia
Carry a bowie knife
And wear my hair like Hepburn parted on the side
And learn card tricks and buy

In a future five years from now
I'm one hundred and twenty pounds
And I never get hung over
Because I will be the picture of discipline
Never minding what state I'm in
And I will be someone I admire
And it's funny how I imagined
That I would be that person now
But it does not seem to have happened
Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
That I am not exactly the person that I thought I'd be

And in my mind
In the faraway here and now
I've become in control somehow
And I never lose my wallet
Because I will be the picture of of discipline
Never fucking up anything
And I'll be a good defensive driver
And it's funny how I imagined
That I would be that person now
But it does not seem to have happened
Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
That I'll never be the person that I thought I'd be

Planting tulips and vegetables
Which I will mindfully watch over
Not like me now
I'm so busy with everything
That I don't look at anything
But I'm sure I'll look when I am older
And it's funny how I imagined
That I could be that person now
But that's not what I want
But that's what I wanted
And I'd be giving up somehow
How strange to see
That I don't wanna be the person that I want to be

And in my mind
I imagine so many things
Things that aren't really happening
And when they put me in the ground
I'll start pounding the lid
Saying I haven't finished yet
I still have a tattoo to get
That says I'm living in the moment
And it's funny how I imagined
That I could win this, win this fight
But maybe it isn't all that funny
That I've been fighting all my life
But maybe I have to think it's funny
If I wanna live before I die
And maybe it's funniest of all
To think I'll die before I actually see
That I am exactly the person that I want to be

We have one filthy pillow to share and your lips are in my hair
Someone upstairs has a rat that we laughed at
And people are drinking
And singing Van Halen and Slayer on a ukulele tear

Well, we found an apartment
It’s not much to look at
A futon on a floor
Torn-off desktop for a door
All the decor's made of milk crates and duct tape
And if we have sex
They can hear us through the floor
But we don’t do that anymore

And I lay there wondering, what is the matter?
Is this a matter of worse or of better?
You took the blanket, so I took the bedsheet
But I would have held you if you'd only

Look how quaint
And how quiet and private

It's the nicest flat around

And I walked upstairs
And the sight of it made my heart pound
And I wrapped my arms around me

And I stood there wondering, what is the matter?
Is this a matter of worse or of better?
You walked right past me and straightened the covers
But I would still love you if you wanted a lover
And you said
All the money in the world
Won't buy a bed so big and wide
To guarantee that you won't accidentally touch me
In the night

Now we're both mostly paralyzed
Don't know how long we've been lying here in fear
Too afraid to even feel
I find my glasses and you turn the light out
Roll off on your side
Like you've rolled away for years
Holding back those king-size tears

And I still don't ask you, what is the matter?
Is this a matter of worse or of better?
You take the heart failure
I'll take the cancer
I've long stopped wondering why you don't answer

You can certainly see how fulfilling a life
From the cost and size of stone of our final resting home
We got some nice ones right under a cherry tree
You and me lying the only way we know
Side by side and still and cold

And I finally ask you, what was the matter?
Was it a matter of worse or of better?

On the threshold

And I really want to talk to you
I really really wanted to
But once you get your
Mind made up
There is no getting
Through to you

For a while it was challenging
Before it became typical
And now it really
Isn't interesting
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man cry

I'm lying on the sofa
And the radio is blaring
And I'm scanning
Through the stations
As the boys declare
Their feelings
But it doesn't feel like feelings
It feels like they're pretending
It's like they just want
Blowjobs
And they know these songs
Will get them

And I really want to talk to you
I really really wanted to
But I have learned my lesson
Now
And you're not the one
I'm turning to

For a while it was challenging

I lay myself before you

Down the gauntlet

Well enough not to get into it
I should learn but I'm an idiot
You only want an argument

It was almost even comforting
Before it became typical
And now it really
Is not interesting
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man cry

To see a grown man
Throw a temper fit
To see a grown man
Cross his arms
And sit as if the
Whole wide world would end
If he was not a part of it
But at the same time
With no confidence
Never realizing
The consequence he's having
On the ones he loves
Because he thinks he makes
No difference

Amanda Palmer,"Every time I walk along this street, I think of you
And given it's the city's major thoroughfare, I'm screwed
Taking an alternative's a little hard to do
It's the street I live on

Massachusetts Avenue

There's the crosswalk where a milk truck almost ran me down
The day I finally saw you when you got back into town
I don???t know if you saw me, 'cause I turned so quick around
Hiding into traffic, clearly dying to be found

Do you remember crying in the park and shutting up?
Do you remember running and me trying to catch up?
Do you remember loving me more than I could be loved?
I chased you for so long, and when I caught you, I gave up
There's no other way to get to work
After all these years, it just gets worse
Memories so dull and well-rehearsed

Storrow Drive is pretty in the fall
You don't have go home in a straight line
You don't have to go back home at all

There's the cemetery where I broke your heart in two
And there's the pair of stones that we had laughed was me and you
I stared at them a long time, and I asked if it was true
If I still really loved you
And they answered

Yes, I do

(I do)

People come and go, but these four lanes will never move

They've been circling
Since the day they were born 

It's disturbing
How they're circling
Fifty feet from the pond

Pretty often

I don't want to be told

It's a problem
It's a problem
It's a problem I know
And I won't keep what I can't catch in my bare hands without a net
It's hard enough to walk on grass so conscious of the consequences

They've been jerking
They've been jerking
In a pail by the dock

I know that oxygen might
Make them blossom and die
But I'm not going to talk

Feed them details
Feed them emails
They'll eventually grow

But it's not working
It's not working
Not as far as I know

And killing things is not so hard it's hurting that's the hardest part
And when the wizard gets to me I'm asking for a smaller heart

And I got you
I thought that I got you
now I'll ruin it all

Feeling helpless
Acting selfish
Being human and all

And they're jumping
And they're jumping
But they'll never get out

Just keep touring
Just keep on ignoring
Be a good little trout

And the butcher stops and winds his watch and lays their lives down on the block
He raises up his hatchet and the big hand strikes a compromise

No complaining
No complaining

And it's beating
Look, it's still beating

It's hurting that's the hardest part 
And when the wizard gets to me 
I'm asking for a smaller heart 
And if he tells me ""no"" 
I'll hold my breath until I hit the floor 
Eventually I'm know I'm doomed 
To get what I am asking for

Now my heart is exactly the size 
Of a six-sided die cut in half
Made of ruby red stained glass

I'll love you and I'll make you laugh?

Pushed the button got the shock trick 
Stickers in your bag 
Had your number but I lost it

Just like the song, we're addicted to the L word 
Up past your head, down your back, around your ankles 
Ready for attack, you're obsessioned and then strangled 
Cringe like you're cursed 
With your wreckingbally necklace 
I saw it first and I crushed it with my hamfist 
High for the contest, who's the better nazi 
Eye to eye to eye, now I'm blind and you can catch me 
Catch me if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can.

Amanda Palmer,"I wish that Joan of Arc wouldn’t hang around the park
Pronouncing that she won’t get burned again
Her armour’s very shiny and her message is divine
But I wish she’d take a day off now and then

She said it clears your head when you come back from the dead
With your sword as sharp as anything that cuts
And to prove it she bisected three young tourists from Utrecht
Which rapidly displayed a lot of guts

She says we need to
Raise a brand new army
And the flag of France
So proudly she unfurled
And the people that
She hated will be neatly bifurcated
And the British will
No longer rule the world

(She says) it was a mistake to let them burn her at the stake
And she learned a lesson back there in the flames
So she’s going to kill the queen and then she’ll rescue Old Orleans
And it’s really hard to hang around with saints

I think I ought to tell her that the English left in failure
And they don’t go back to France except on hols
But I saw her vivisect a man who wanted to correct her 
And the playground soon resembled Grand Guignol

She says we need to
Raise a brand new army
And she marched us
Round until we couldn’t stand
She says the nation
She abhors will soon be writhing on the floor
And the British will
No longer rule her land

And she’s waiting for the dauphin who will come across the ocean
And knows that God agrees with her complaints
So I’m hoping she’ll ignore my English accent in her war
‘Cause it’s really hard to hang around with saints

She says we need to
Raise a brand new army
And the flag of France
So proudly she unfurled

Left without a word and nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
So I ask God

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

I know I may sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You want to come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one I once adore
That they can't have my love no more
My heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you have me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,
You made me feel like I could not breathe
When all I wanted to do was feel your touch
And to give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my loving now, but you can't have it
Oh God

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Give you what I feel make you love what you hear
That no one in this world would ever bring me down
Five years from now still be in town breaking it down
Nothing but grand material bump this shit in your sterio
Got you wanting sterical cuz my shit so lyrical
To all the men who said they put my foot in the door
Just took my music now it?s me they ignore
Tell everyone they didn?t know what wasn?t so
They told me I was worth much much more
They said I deserve my big chance
So I signed that contract and now I?m set 10 years in advanced
To those who didn?t give a suck I wish you luck
Now can you please tell me what wut wut tell me wut

Would you like me to put your shirt and your pants
in my washin' machine, in my washin' machine?

Make yourself at home boy, just relax.
Give me 5 minutes and I'll be back,
so I can hit that, hit that, hit that.

I can't see a damn thing, 'cause it's pitch black.
So I turn to my left, 'cause I hear a noise.
Comin' close to my ear, I hear a voice.
A voice that says, if I move he gon' make it hurt,
so I lift my arms, while he takes my shirt.
You do it hard, but you never make it hurt.
It's like havin' a seizure, while you put in work.

Before I even knew, there was a you and me,
Now I can't wait to see your smile,
When I wake up each day,
It makes it worth while,
With the kinda love you plant inside,
Especially with a heart so empty as mine.
All your soft tenderness, is the one thing that I don't wanna miss.

I pray,
When it's time for me to say goodbye
I'll never forget, looking in your eyes,
I pray,
That I feel your touch
And that God doesn't forget our love,
I pray,
When I close my eyes,
I can still see visions of you, on my mind.
I pray,
That I see you in another life,
I pray that you're still by my side.
Oh I pray.

Everything that you give to me,
Only comes in a fantasy,
It seems like life goes so fast,
But in this time I wanna make it last. (I pray)
I hate that we live to die,
But only God knows why (I pray)
We all have a purpose,
And to see you again It'll all be worth it.

I wish that I could stop time,
I wish that I could rewind,
To the very begining of every second of my life.
To ask God on my hands and knees,
To never let me forget, all my special memories.
See I'm only promised today,
And if it's my time to go,
I don't want the love of my life, to ever fade away,
So one last time,
Let me open my eyes.
To see, what my life used to be like.
Oh God.

I'm on the 10 goin' West and I'm heading straight to the H
From Louisiana got money to make
They got some bitches I didn't cut
Some clubs I didn't crash

Some bars I haven't run up the tab on a nigga ass
Neglecting my nuts I work too much
Fuck gettin' tipsy tryin' to get fucked up
I need some rup to sip

So I can lean in my cut dogg
Eyes focused on pussy
Run some G on a damn broad

Sippin' and dippin' til at least 7 in the morn
My 24's I call them the hoe catchers
Catch the type of hoes that wouldn't usually sweat ya
Bet cha I do it bigger than ya'll

Just bring me some good and a big fat goo
So I can puff and blow smoke on a hater like you

Amanda Perez,"Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that it makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side
O I'm losing my mind, steady thinking about you all the time
O I'm telling you this is it, I can't live with out your kiss

Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you
I can see it now that I don't deserve you

So many nights I sat and fooled with you
Not even realizing that I might lose you
Never admitting that I make mistakes.
Not having no more of them tears falling down your face

But sometimes love is hard to recognize, even when you see it with your own two eyes
Why do I feel this way in my life?
Why can't I just run and hide from all the blame that I've given you.
Tell me why because I don't deserve you

Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you, I can see it now that I don't deserve you

I don't deserve to feel your touch...
O I don't deserve to feel your love
I don't deserve to feel your lips, to have your kiss
But baby I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you

O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right

With every choice
You make in your life

Know what's right

And just deny that voice inside
But it's never under oath

In my life of the truth

For the fortunate few
It's a right of passage
It's a secret of life

Creeping over my mind
Can I find true love
Before I run out of Time

I say a prayer to the Lord above

This is my dream Life/When will my real life begin/When will I find myself/When will the dreamin end/I waited so long/This is my Time/When will my reall life begin
Verse 2:
I wait in the water/As the stream rushes by/I go deeper and deeper/And i wish i could fly/ Far from this moment/ and away from my past/ how do i discover/ all i see through this glass/ How will i know/When I have finally broken through/ there's a world out there/ and its so bran new
Chorus
No body knows/no one really knows/ How I feel, or what goes on inside me
Chorus
Real Life Begin/oooooooooooo

Amanda Stott,"Wide-eyed, maybe that's true
But most of the time I can see through you
You say I'm too sweet for my own good
But when your anger lets you down, understood

You're burnin' up from inside out
While you're riding you're knocked down
There are things that you can't see
And one of them is me

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Just blow away

Tell me what I should do 
When you want to paint a day every shade of blue
Is it too late for us to shine
Can you crawl into the light and just be mine

Your world of words is so unreal
Sometimes I wonder if you feel
The same emotions that I do
When I'm close to you

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Just blow away

Do you wonder what would happen if you let me in?
Are you afraid to give yourself away?
Will the fervor disappear and then I come crashing in 
Crashing in to the light of day

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain, hey

You've been walking in a paper rain
Storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Just blow away",Paper Rain
Amanda Stott,"In the blink of an eye,
Sparks flying, fires die
Some things weren't meant to last
No you won't be the first
To break that heart of hers
And you won't be the last

So let her go let her go let her goâ?¦
Let her go let her go let her goâ?¦
She'll get over it in time
One less burden on her mind
It hurt a little bit
But she'll get over it
When those tears drop from her face
Someone else will take your place
And she'll be over you, for good

So let her go let her go let her goâ?¦ 
Try to tell her goodbye
Oh no your mouth goes dry
And your heart starts to sink
Then you look in her eyes
Oh you just might be surprised
She's stronger than you think

Make up your mind (make up your mind)
You can't take forever
She'll get over you in timeâ?¦

[Chorus]",She'll Get Over It
Amanda Stott,"Sometimes clouds, sometimes waterfalls,
Life can be unpredictable
Sometimes ""hello"", sometimes ""see ya 'round""
My heart spinds like a merry-go-round

When I kiss the sun on your face 
It feels like a moment of grace

I'm chasing the sky, I can fly like an eagle
And I can see everything clearly
My heart's spinning fast, like the wings of pleasure
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real

I feel crazy, I feel naked 'round you
My defences are on the ground
I had my world, it was so uncomplicated
Now it's you everyday that I wanna run to

I never knew my heart had wings
I never knew my soul could fly

I'm chasing the sky, I can fly like an eagle
And I can see everything clearly
My heart's spinning fast, like the wings of pleasure
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real

Maybe your love is my yellow brick road
I can never lose my way

My heart's spinning fast, like the wings of pleasure
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real

I'm chasing the sky, my heart's spinning faster

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

Amandla Stenberg,"I was made to love her, been working at it
Half of my life, I’ve been an addict
And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy, livin’ with her Macky

So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

And where would I be, feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only
And what’s there left to say

Amapola,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Amar,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last

Guck, mein Name ist Programm, du wirst einfach gekillt
Du bist nichts wert, nur ein falscher Ruf, du verschwindest
Du wirkst abgeturnt, weil man dich bei Google nicht findet
Rappen ist für mich so leicht, wie mir die Schuhe zu binden
Ich bin angeblich überheblich, du hingegen empfindest
Diesen Shit hier grad als eine Stufe zu sick
Ich bin nicht Hengst, doch hab schon längst mit deiner Stute gefickt

Amar,"Aus einem Land mit tiefen Wäldern und wilden Bergen
Geboren zwischen Wölfen, Bären und wilden Pferden
In einer Zeit, in der Menschen hungern und Kinder sterben
Ein einziger Mann stürzt ein ganzes Volk ins Verderben, ein Diktator!
Polizeistaat, Geheimdienst, Korruption, die drei Säulen seiner Diktatur
Die Medien, die Zeitung, die Propaganda
Kein Hollywood, kein Micky Maus und kein rosa Panther
Im Fernsehen den ganzen Tag Regierungschef und Staatsmenschen
Den Geist in Ketten gehalten in Form von Staatsgrenzen
Die Verschleppung, die Folter, der Mord, in jeder Stadt, jeden Dorf
Todesangst bei jeden falschen Wort
Vorsicht selbst bei was man seinen Nachbar verratet
Auf diese Angst basiert die Kraft dieses Machtapparates
Doch die Evolution macht den Jäger zum Gejagten
Am Tag der Revolution!

Aus einem Land, wo die Sanddünen gegen Wellen peitschen
Wo man weit reisen muss für Wasserquellen, Stern als Zeichen
Wo der König alles hat und sein Volk muss feilschen
Regiert nicht nach Gottes Gesetz, gehört zu den Falschen
Wo die Menschen sich ins Meer stürzen mit ein Reifen
In der Hoffnung das gelobte Land zu erreichen
Doch das Meer spült die Leichen zurück
Diese Zeit ist verrückt
Spür das Leid in meinem Stück
Wo Demonstration mit Gewalt niedergeschlagen werden
Schrei nicht zu laut in den Wald, du könntest dafür sterben
Wo man sich lieber Speedboote besorgt 
Um seine Kilos an Haschisch nach Europa zu verscherbeln
Die Wahrheit wird immer geflüstert und es nervt mich
Ich unterwerf mich nur Gott, fick die Opposition
Doch die Evolution macht den Jäger zum Gejagten
Am Tag der Revolution!

Aus einem Land, wo die Regierung gegen die am Arsch ist
Die frische Kohle hält die Menschen ruhig und apathisch
Wo Leute hungern, doch die Reichen feiern ihre Partys
Gendarmerie am patrouillieren wie ein Haufen Nazis
Wo Religion dazu benutz wird Ängste zu erzeugen
Wenn du verschleppt wirst auf der Straße gibt es keine Zeugen
Wo man den freien Glauben zwingt den Staat zu beugen
Und Minderheiten ihre Herkunft bis heute leugnen
Wo man für Wörter in die falsche Richtung stirbt
Wo das Volk resigniert und dein Stolz sich verliert
Wo Menschen kämpfen für das Brot hier mit bloßen Händen
Der Weg in die Freiheit ist versperrt hier von hohen Wänden
Wo kleine Dörfer von Militär attackiert werden
Nur weil hier die Leute bereit sind für ihr Recht zu sterben
Wo Regenbögen ihre Farben verlieren
Wo die Gesetze sich im Osten in den Straße verirren

En este puerto de incertidumbres

Con una astilla del mástil del barco
Atravesándome el alma
Y si me duele dejar que me queje
Para escuchar tu consuelo

Lo quiero oír de tu boca partida
Por donde escapan los besos
Lo quiero oír de tu boca

Que no es tan difícil tumbarme
Pero una vez en suelo
Más bajo no puedo caer

Que un día me levantare

Ahora estamos despiertos
Este es nuestro momento

Salta aunque nadie te comprenda
Por encima de cabezas huecas
Salta como un gato
Tú no eres un pájaro enjaulado

Nadie sabe nuestro secreto
Nadie quiere saberlo 
Ellos viven con los zapatos en el suelo

Salta con los brazos abiertos
Con los pelos al viento
Este es nuestro momento

Salta aunque nadie te comprenda
Por encima de cabezas huecas
Salta como un gato
Tu no eres un pájaro enjaulado

Salta aunque nadie te comprenda

Salta aunque nadie te comprenda
Por encima de cabezas huecas

Y tarde para cambiar
Aún me guardo algunas fotos 
Que no me atrevo a mirar

Era todo tan hermoso
Que no podía durar
En la flor de nuestras vidas
Con tanto amor para dar

Solías llamar de madrugada
Me hacías saltar de la cama
Salíamos a quemar
Todo el fin de semana
Casi sin blanca

En el fondo reconozco
Que nos gustaba jugar
A tener el mundo en contra nuestra

Quería cumplir dieciocho
Quería vivir para siempre a mi aire
Y tú lo sabías bien 
Lo que empieza acaba
Se nos escapa

Era todo tan hermoso
Se fue deprisa y no volverá

Y mientras partía una nave hacia marte
Tú me prometías nunca olvidarme

Que tu vida cae en picado 
¿Quién te va a querer ahora?

Ahora busca una señal 
En los ángeles del cielo. Canciones de Amaral

Y siento que tu risa es llanto
Cuando buscas en mí
Dónde nunca hubo nada

Colores y formas que se van
Y un tímido lamento Hispano
Tiemblo al sentir
Como quemas tus alas en mí

Biarritz, dormida soledad
Lleva mis pasos hacia el mar
Que no despierte ya
Que no pueda escapar

Más lejos que nunca voy a estar
Como un pálido reflejo
Es tan difícil ya
Que cierren mis heridas

Veo colores y formas que se van
Y un tímido lamento hispano
Tiemblo al sentir
Como quemas tus alas en mí

Y el tiempo aparece ante los dos
Mi dulce muerte, mi dolor
Como un testigo cruel
Que se impone sin hablar

Biarritz, dormida soledad
Lleva tus pasos hacia el mar
Que no despierte ya
Que no pueda escapar

El tiempo aparece ante los dos
Mi dulce muerte, mi dolor
Como un testigo cruel
Que se impone sin hablar

Siento que la luz se apaga
Y sé que la vida se va
Hasta el final
Aprieta hasta el final

Lleva tus pasos hacia el mar

Amaran's Plight,"I am entering the winter of my life
Reflecting on my days gone by
The process has begun, the picture is abstract
There's no turning back from the voice inside my head
From inside my head

Looking back on my life
A sadness always chilling me
Within a distant childhood dream
The din of beating wings
Are muffled by the drugs that keep me sane
The snow white sheets they hide the pain
It's sad to say

The whispered truth can lead her to salvation
My setting sun will turn the page
A prophecy born of grace and it's dedication
My broken body will be she'd

All the groundwork is set
And what we learn from the Bible, we know
These are the words I believe
Oh, the angel she'll weep, then read between all these lines
Then she'll be filled with the light
This sick and dying man in room 316
(Thirty years, strong in my heart)
He'll provide all the answers, tell them what this all means
It's a rare form of cancer and my family's curse
For it will be end of life... of life

The whispered truth can lead to her salvation
My setting sun will turn the page
A prophecy born of grace and it's dedication
My broken body will be she'd

John's been gone for days
And I can't even find his shadow
No depth of self-restraint to commiserate

Mild minds and soft solutions, she's crying on my shoulder
I've sustained resistance long enough
Now I won't turn her away

The whispered truth has lead me to this revelation
My setting sun will turn the page
A prophecy born of grace and it's dedication
My broken body will be she'd

These hidden truths can lead you to your salvation
The trumpets' call will turn the page
Words of wisdom are cloaked in a careful narration
'Cause this fallen world soon shall pass

Soon shall pass",Revelation
Amaranthe,"You are gone to the highest bidder

I even told you what would happen theoretically
There is this something that I need to know

Searching for a place
That I have left behind
And all I wanna believe
That you could bleed so

Transformed to someone else

How can I
Believe there's another sun

As night has taken what is left of day
And everything is like it's made of clay
I feel like I am the only one
Feeding my need to be reckoned as someone

Amaranthe,"Illusions conducted my life
Blurred and ailed eyes
The curtain darken the broken mirror
I no longer fear them
As I'm losing the grip of it all

We blindfold our own eyes
And believe their velvet lies

This is a step towards tomorrow
The truth of what we will become

An initiated Armageddon
A covert deceiving begun
So close to define
What you have to sacrifice

Abandoned a life in recluse
Predestines before
My shadow was not even born
I see things clearer
So these are my options
Both will end up in torment and pain
Just a fragment of what you will see

Their words will feed our own addiction
To blindfold our own eyes

Amaranthe,"Hear me scream
It's unreal, what's inside of me
Broken bones and the code that hunts me
I come home, I'm alone, is it gone
What I'm feeling is surreal

World in flames
It's a chase, I'm a cornered man
It's a pulse in my veins, no delays
It's a rain, it's a chamber of dust
As I'm viewing the plains

Of the sorrow I lust

I have no faith in our reality
No mirror can correct my destiny
One thing to rule what I've become
Take it or leave it 'cause this is my love song

Have to bare my own soul, unveil me
To discern it's my turn, have to learn
I have to face it

Ruined in pieces, a human machine

Amaranthe,"A hole in my heart, a changing desire
My softest command, set this love afire
Give in, breathe out, I'm lost this time

Doesn't matter if the road is far
'Cause there are no regrets and there is no stress
Together we are limit, limitless

Doesn't matter if the road, the road is far

Amaranthe,"It was a hard time living in the city
Broke my mind, I was trying hard to fit in
Somehow I tried to belong
They were always telling me that I was wrong
I was running around, I was chasing a dream
They had their eyes on the dirty limousine
I had to decide, I was coming along
And then it changed when you sang me that song

Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll

It was a rough time, running out of money
Had a guitar and my jacket on my shoulder
Somehow I tried to be strong 
But everyone just told me that I tried for too long
When you come to the room, well you have to decide
I tell you not to fight it and it will be alright
I've got chains deep inside now I can't live without it
And yes you are right, they are playing my song

At least there's some song bringing me home

We're together for one night and together we belong

Amaryllys Duo,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",All Through the Night

y no hubo paz en mi corazon 
hasta que un siglo despues pude verla.

Perdóname todo si es que te fallé
Es que no contaba con tu corazón

Cuando esta tan cerca la felicidad

Y a veces de pronto vemos escapar
Aquello que siempre debimos amar

Y es que necesito tu perdón ahora
Si no estas aquí me mata la demora
Solo sabe perdonar quien ha querido
Con el corazón

Si tu me perdonas yo no voy a irme
Voy a darte todo voy a decidirme
No me dejes en la sombra, ya retorna

Es que no comprendes que te necesito
Te llevo en mi sangre siempre como un vicio

Si tú no regresas no hay felicidad
Solo la tristeza en mi se quedará
Esta vida mía no da para más
Si no me iluminas con tu libertad

En la cara al despertar
Cada palabra que le pronuncié
La hacía soñar

No era raro verla en el jardín
Corriendo tras de mí
Y yo dejándome alcanzar
Sin duda, era feliz

Era una buena idea
Cada cosa sugerida
Ver la novela en la televisión
Contarnos todo

Jugar eternamente
El juego limpio de la seducción
Y las peleas terminarlas
Siempre en el sillón

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Me va a extrañar y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Me va a extrañar
Cuando tenga ganas de
Dormir y acariciar

Al mediodía era una aventura en
La cocina se divertía
Con mis ocurrencias y reía

Cada caricia le avivaba
El fuego a nuestra chimenea
Era sencillo pasar
El invierno en compañía

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

And I'm bound for a far and distant land
A tale would tell of my poor heart and how it grieves
So for you my love this sorrowful Pavan

(Chorus:)
I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye

Love me hard with the dawn I'll be gone
And I don't know if I'll be back again
God as my guard I'm the champion of the wronged

Off to holy wars to fight the Saracen

I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye

While you're away does your spouse turn a whore
Or a chastity belt maiden while crusader's at war
I'm tired of my chain mail
My armour makes me sore
And it all seems so futile

Weep you will but my love I cannot stay
Dry your eyes and we'll share a parting kiss
Wait until the advent of that day
When I'm home and gone is sadness as this

I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye",Pavan

Skies are clear now Winter's gone
And dreams of love approach reality
The once bare boughs of lilac trees
Are haunted now by honey bees
And all the world exudes vitality

Weather's fine, leaves are green
Buds start blossoming, air feels clean
And young hearts' fancies turn to love
And young hearts' fancies turn to love

Fresh green grass in bluebelled wood
Adorns the ground where snow once stood
And lark ascending sings on scented air
Such fragrance sweet are you my love
That voice unseats both lark and dove
And beauty bold reposes in your stare

Weather's fine, leaves are green
Buds start blossoming, air feels clean
And young hearts' fancies turn to love
And young hearts' fancies turn to love

Let Cupid's bow unleash it's darts
To land the blows on Spring sweethearts
For in this season lovers choose their ways
So let us too succumb to love
We'll melt as do the clouds above
When sun's illustrious rays condense the haze

Buds start blossoming, air feels clean
And young hearts' fancies turn to love

At mariners yonder
And how their lives must be
With oceans to wander coves of tranquility

Of his sailors life than he

Amazing Transparent Man,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Bitch

Ambassador,"From the Philly pad I've been servin' Christ and now it's really 
Nonbelievers are treating Jesus like a silly fad
Weak like the spot Achilles had they got me really mad
Talking 'bout relationships they never really had
The kill me dog but it's not about the skills we have
Because the city is sickly the need the Balm on Gilead
Known for doin' things that's odd to see like the Iliad
Like standing on top of the water like a lily pad
The Life Giver who turns my heart like a river
From when it was trashy and when it was nasty like lives
He fills His quiver with children with who follow His orders
Sons and daughters
Who've been changed like dollars to quarters
Holler, he'll pour you grace and then give you some more 
Give you wisdom when you're in a trial like a court case
Can't show you the pure face but you can get the pure taste goodness
Never running out like you're raw space
All sing to the only acceptable offering
All things reconciled by His death on the cross beam
With blood that was clean, and blood that ""ca-ching!""
He purchased men so that must mean worship the King
God the Son, the only One with a plan to redeem
Stronger that the Army-Navy, Air force, and the Marines
Elohim the A to Z and all that's in between
The Supreme who could have let us fall yet intervened
Called the elect made sure we accept
Roots us in Christ so we can grow like a chia pet
So hail the King, priest and prophet
The inexhaustible topic The Person
Of God you can peep with your optic

In the eyes of this world my life is trife
They don't understand when I say I've died to Christ died to my rights
Livin' selfless, render myself helpless
Trustin' God, set my heart where his eternal wealth is
What else is there to live for, what else is there to hope in still
I bow to Christ with a broken with a broken will
Becoming broken bread and poured out wine
When seen with the natural eye authentic
Christian livin' blows the mind
What validates my faith go check
You'll see from the holy scroll to the codex
That God inspires the whole text
The scriptural facts will surprise
And paralyze you like broke necks
Shake up your whole set
Leave your soul vexed
I pray you dream of his holiness and wake up in cold sweats
Can't dissolve the mixture
No matter how odd the picture
You can't deny the God of scripture equipped with tha
Truths that transform becoming a thorn where man swarm
We bring the real when we kingdom build upon the rock
He's the one you can either stand on
Or be the one whom he lands on
Weather the sinkin' sand storms
Until you realize there's no other God
Worth taking a chance on
We keep our hands on the plow breaking up the fallow ground
While Christ can found seek him and follow now

It's been told that men without
Christ would face insurmountable odds
And the greatest of these would be a close encounter with God
(and you don't want that) even though your free to give it a try
100% before the Most High
Either live it or die
Cause ever since Adam sinned life was done
But thanks to Christ the Son
When Death marked us up with it's pricin' gun
Jesus came and smiled and paid
For us all and brought the work of sin to an
End like the child labor law
When the wild and wayward saw
That in Jesus God forgave us all who repented
And consented that our way was wrong
Then they saw why the truth rocks us
So hard enough to work arduous
To bogard yo just pardon us. Like the
Marginous distance between mars and us
Understand men are from dust and
Smart enough or large enough to harness
Up and jump the marvelous distance
Between us and God we just tarnish up His image
My mission is to open eyes
And I'm steady mobilizin'
Because of the hope I find in Jesus, tougher than
Teflon, hung with the common thugs
Though He had more class than Upper Eshelon
I'm in love with the way He put us back together, life was broke
Then Christ came in handy like Black and Decker
The fact is pleasure could never measure up black

Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
You crawled on my land
Now I grow in your hand
Always like the first time
Unlike the others
They're so-so
So called lovers
Theirs is the push that comes to shove
But not in our evolution
It's natural
From great to grand
True love is never really planned
And wipes the memory of those who came
Before our evolution
It's natural
And with you see me walk on air
I know that I can do it
When you're holding tightly to my sleeve
The one with my heart upon it
Hard as a mountain range
Bright as a harvest moon
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join our show
Every dog must have its day
Everyone's a winner
And every time the lights go down on us
I'm the beginner 
How lady luck has changed
""So long Salem""
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join the show
Free as the wind
Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
An interlude
With haunting melodies of nursery rhymes
Singing the changes, singing the changes, singing...
I hear talk of classroom drama
Maybe it's a kind of psychodrama
Children, the mirrors of our yesterdays
On the land out of the sea
Blowing in the breeze
Mind over metaphor
Fall in love with innocence
Don't dally long with diligence
Stand up choose me
Don't refuse me
They pawned our world of peace
A flock of sheep to fleece
Our flood of love won't cease
No harm can come our way
And it's easy to see what sets us apart
From the creatures still on the ocean bed
Our evolution it's natural
It goes from great to grand
Falls into place like something that we planned
When you curl your arms around my frame
Or curl your lips around my name
And do just what comes natural
The first thing on your mind
Do just what comes natural
I prefer your kind of human nature",Human Nature

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Without you, I would change it if I could

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

Fear fills the emptiness
That I have inside of me
Time is not standing still
Only you can set me free

Every day I see your face
Whatever I do, you're here
I can't take it anymore
Cause you still live in me

Without you, I have lost myself
Without you, I am lost for good
Without you, I am crying, baby
Without you, I would change it if I could

Every day I wonder where you are

Where could you be?
Baby,

Come back to me",Without You
Amber Brooke,"Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing",Immigrant Song
Amber Bullock,"This world sometimes seems cruel and cold
And pain doth pierce my very soul

A place where I can go

A place of peace where love abides
Where justice reigns and God resides
There is a place, a secret place
A place where I can go

For you shall hide me in Your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies pursue me
You'll keep me safe from harm

And when my heart is filled with pain
No peace it seems I will find again
I find that place, a secret place
A place where I can go

For You shall hide me in Your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies pursue me
You'll keep me safe from harm

Amber Coffman,"I can't just sit around feeling upset
Dwelling on my loneliness
Maybe if I step out
Go get some sun
Maybe today I'll get something done
Kick off the covers
But I don't move
Even though I know what to do

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

I wanna be swallowed up
In an ocean of love
That's all I keep thinking of
But I can't make the water move
Water moves on its own
Gotta be okay for a while alone
Look out the window, feeling the glare
Wish I knew how to come up for air
But when I can't see the light
And I wanna hide
When I feel like I'm losing my mind

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

I'm so tired and I know why I spent too long
Trying to change all these thing I can't control
And now I finally let it go
Watch the sky open up and turn the fall into a dive
See that I'm gonna be just fine

Al I want is to feel strong
Well I know who I can count on

We can keep on, wouldn't that be nice?

We made the ship that sailed us on
But now all our problems remain unsolved
Our voices don't carry at all

We drew a line into the sand
And wrestled with our final feelings
They'll all be frozen in this moment
We have no messages left to send

And this love wants not to hinder our evolution
It only wants the best for you
The best for me

We traveled time and seasons passed
And really stopped us in our tracks
We flew through cherries into broken glass
And lived to see the aftermath

And when they ask us
When they ask what led to this conclusion
We'll tell them we did the best we could
Yes we did

May winds of change help calm your seas
And may blue feathers fall to you from up above
And may you always know you are loved",Kindness

Like a starless night
Come this far, you'd think that I 
Would have no trouble trying to walk a few more miles
But as if it's scrolling through words and pictures like I'm paralyzed

Nobody knows, nobody knows how I feel
Nobody sees my soul
And when the wind blows, I just wanna blow away
I wanna say goodbye to today

Wanna hide, feel too shaky to move through the world outside
So I'm just here wasting, wasting away
And I woke up from a nightmare
Everyone I know disappeared
And like I knew along, I did not belong
Have nowhere to go, be someone nobody knows

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you

I have lived without love, without all that I need
See the marks that I bare, and the shame that runs deep
You have made every moment so worthless to me and
I can't understand this at all

'Cause I don't want to see our lives destroyed by dismay
In these times of try, we live or die again

You're my summer that fades, to these cold autumn days
You're my keepsake, my friend, and my fears
You're the strength that's inside and I swear on my life
I will always be there by your side

It's hard to live without love with the chance that you may
Find the whole world is waiting to hear what you say
From the heart through your veins to the answers that came
Here to save me, to guide me, to show me the way

So I don't want to see our lives destroyed by dismay
In these times of try, we live or die again

So take this time to see that I
Can't leave this all to chance
So take this time to see that I
Have hope that lies will end

Amber Rubarth,"Walking past my lover's house
Bitter taste still in my mouth
Too much whiskey, too much smoke
Last night's tears hang on my coat

But now the rain has stopped its fall
Streets shine like a mirror ball
Sun comes on, it's just enough
Watch the flower's waking up

It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again

Big machines all in a row
Mother with her child in tow
Change old paper for silver coins
Lose myself in all this noise

Wake up from a peaceful rest
Counting down, one minute left
Cotton stops its jog in place
I hold it warm against my face

It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again

What's this in my dungarees
In my back pocket, curled and creased
My old notebook, filled with you
Our secrets now just streaks of blue

It's all a mess but beautiful
This emptiness, a gift I hold
I write a poem with you in mind
And leave the memories behind
I leave the memories behind

It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again

And as the dust clears away
You start to notice something
Each time a piece crashes down into the floor
You?re a little lighter than just before

You?re unfinished art that keeps going, it keeps going
It keeps going and going and going and going..

Tu dalla rabbia ormai non ci vivevi più 
E adesso che siamo tornati insieme 
Ti dico t'amo e tu non me lo dici mai 

E adesso giura, adesso giura 
Adesso giura che non hai paura 
Che sia una fregatura dirmi ""amore mio""

Ti spara al cuore e pum! Tu sei caduto giù

M'appartieni e se ci tieni 
Tu prometti e poi mantieni

Se non è amore me ne andrò all'inferno 
Ma quando ci sorprenderà l'inverno 
Questo amore sarà già un incendio 
Lo grido cento mille volte a sera 
Ma disperata come una preghiera 
Non voglio più svegliarmi sola sola 
Se non ci sarai 

Prometti, per sempre sarà 
Prometti, indietro non si tornerà 

Se c'è una crisi la mandiamo via 
Perché i problemi tuoi sono problemi miei 
Bisogna dirci tutto fra di noi 
E a tutti gli altri poi non li diremo mai 

E adesso giura, adesso giura 
Adesso giura sopra al mio diario 
Dove c'è la tua foto che hai dedicato a me 
Che ho consumato con i baci e pianti 
Ed io per colpa tua non piangerò mai più 

T'appartengo ed io ci tengo

But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Ambrose,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view

Ambrose,"Barbra Streisand If I Love Again Lyrics:
I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again

The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.

Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

Ambrose Karels,"Every body stops
And stares at me
These two teeth are
Gone as you can see
I don't know just who
To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""
It seems so long since I could say
""Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!""

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be
If I could only whistle (thh)

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you

Ambrosia,"Someone talks about a road
At the end find life's gold

I went out to get a drink of water
But I saw an ocean far away
I thought of how much beyond awaits me
Foolishly I turned my head the other way

Do you like where you're livin' at?
I'm not happy inside
You could build a golden house
Yeah, but still I'm sad inside

I set out on a long and lonely journey
And traveled through some strange and distant lands
And many times I thought I'd found life's meaning
But it slipped away like water in the sand

Narration of ""Jabberwock"" from ""Alice In Wonderland""

'Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.

""Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch ?Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumlous Bandersnatch!""

He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought ?So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.

""And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"" He chortled in his joy.

I've always had a plan, but somehow it never was applied 
Never got my share of lovin'; I've always been denied
I ain't greedy, but I aim to take what rightfully is mine

All I really want is something that I do not have to share 
Hide it under lock and key so they'll never see 
Or they'll never know
And let someone else be responsible
And let the world leave me alone

Ambrosia," Leaping quick on leopard's back
I face the brunt of his attack
In the land of nod i'm king
Until the alarm clock rings

Stepping out from safety's door
I hear the rushing traffic roar
Smiling to myself i say,
""...hooray its a brand new day""

Slashing my way through vine
I'll kill if i have to
I'll be there on time
Clawed through the freeway jam
I curse at the guy who passed me
Last time 'round

In my office settled back
Drink a cup of coffee (black)
Stretch my mind and try'n erase
The thought of the day to face

Life is like the leopard's den
And once you find you've fallen in
A safari of the heart
Surely comes to an end

Madness is our damnation
Strange is the situation we're all in
To one man it matters nothing
Others it shatters something; no one wins

I could not see it myself (though i'd read about it)
I could not hear it myself (though i'd heard about it)
I could not feel it myself (though i knew that it was real)

And that I understand

So city smog and dog eat dog

Well as for me if I had my way

And pass the cake

Take my body, nobody's feeling you

You think that this thing is a lie

I have been chosen to die
I?ll return to hell

Crap your lost, is the only thing that I am thinking

I lost goodness for you
My sin is to know oneself
And see the rotting inside of me

You destroy my mind

In your name of god
I can see you crap
In your name of god
Fucking servant

Condemn me in your game
That you'll believe
This is a mourning from which you?ll never be again

You'll scratch your legs
You'll swallow my sperm
What's your vanity?
This is your reality

Poison clouds, gods a liar
There's nothing left, for the meek

Amebix,"I just buried a friend
He had come to the end
But I can't help feeling that it needn't have been
Caught in the flak
There was no turning back
So he gave up his life for some psychopath's dream

So we're leaving the front
Having taken the brunt
Now we're tired of the slaughter in some foreign land
So the leaders of the war
They fight alone on the shore
Our mutiny over they are left on the sand

We stand as one
We are an army now of many thousand strong
They stand alone
To fight for ravaged land to gain their worthless throne

The boys are coming home

I see within my mind
A vast and lonely plain
Great armies meet in no man's land
To clench their hands in friendship
For the first time
The dark tide is ebbing
A mass of tired humanity drifting toward the dawn

We are coming home",Coming Home
Amebix,"Well you never flew the colours
And I never saw you bend a knee
To any man
But you were never short of brothers
There was always someone
Holding out a helping hand
Well, I remember the summer
We were riding to a show
And our road went on forever
So we were riding nice and slow
And then I heard the band play
And the sun broke through the sky
It was a fine day for a funeral ya
But I never wanted you to die
No one ever wanted you to die
We were watching at the crossroads
When I saw you wiping out
Some metal box just slipped down
Right into the side of you
I was screaming
I was screaming
I was screaming
But nothing was coming out
They always said you were
A dark horse
Because you rode the land alone
But you know I think the real reason
That you were always riding home
And your road goes on forever
The sun will always shine
One day we'll be together
When we cross the final line
When we cross the line
If I turn to you and call you a friend
When all is said and all is done
Will you meet me on the other side
Seven million miles beyond the sun",Beyond the Sun
Amebix,"And in our ignorance we let them take control
And in their wisdom they decreed that we should bow

Their grips extending to encompass all the world
The cages open to accommodate the crowd

When we put our lives into their hands
We put our hands into their chains

Refuse to aid them, refuse to hold their gun
You must refuse to light the fuse, to activate their bomb",Control

Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, respectez moi!

Les perles de réussites sont dans la musique et le sport
Car à l’école ils nous insistent a vite changer de bord,
Nos parcourt sont chaotiques car beaucoup de lacunes nous font viser le SMIC
Mais nous on veut viser la lune, a part nos parents qui nous aiment,
Ils nous prennent tous pour des guignols,
Ils s’étonnent qu’on ait la haine mais nous on veut juste changer la donne.
Un arabe riche est un riche, un arabe pauvre est un arabe,
Soit l’argent nous valorise soit c’est le point sur la table

J’ai besoin qu’on m’entende qu’on me regarde, qu’on ait confiance en moi
Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, croyez-en moi! 
J’ai besoin qu’on m’entende qu’on me regarde, qu’on ait confiance en moi
Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, respectez moi!

On veut des bolides, des lingots, des sacs de fric,
Des bonnes go, percer, être riche et danser mais la vide est corsée! 
On s'entretue pour la richesse et on se perd dans la tristesse,
L’époque nous prive de liberté je ne voit plus d’égalité
Et encore moins de fraternité
On survit dans le ghetto c’est la merde, j’ai la dalle,
Je veux du biff, je vous emmerde dans mon monde
Je vous emmène là ou la vie est si triste!
Sers-moi, regarde-moi, ma gueule est un indice!
Mister Panache, la souffrance en ?, j’ai convoité l’impasse, toucher avec la poisse!
On a tous besoin de reconnaissance!

J’ai besoin qu’on m’entende qu’on me regarde, qu’on ait confiance en moi
Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, croyez-en moi! 
J’ai besoin qu’on m’entende qu’on me regarde, qu’on ait confiance en moi
Et même si ma vie n’est pas un modèle, respectez moi!",Croyez en Moi

Alors pourquoi tu n'es pas le même,

T'as plus qu'à vivre ta vie, moi je reprends la mienne
Sur ce putain d'love game qui me freine

Je fais semblant de rire et je me voile la face

As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us and the rain most surely find us

Through days of sand with a fire in the sky
And through indigo nights
She runs away from a life spent
Being witness to other unwilling participants

Of the rarest kind
You may be one of the walking wounded
But still you fly

When you shared your secret with the world
You saved another mothers child

As she speaks you can tell that
The words are not easy to say
The hold the power to transport her back to that impossible day
But she hasn't any regrets

I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Amelia Blake,"I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
when will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
is it a lesson that I never knew? 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you 
and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see 
you made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye? 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by

Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, ooh 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker",Heartbreaker
Amelia Curran,"Now that your darlin' keeps you home
There goes the best war we've ever had
Now that nobody's all alone
We'll turn forgiveness to forget

If you're in town you'll look me up
And dance the days into the cups
And you will talk of golden river flow 
And given you enough

Bye, bye, years
Of deals and dolls
Bye, bye, Montreal

What wicked patterns we succumb
From the warnings we have run
Now from a figure we have cut the mold
And filled the stadium

If in as many years I call
From the middle of it all
Will you forgive me or forget 
Who we were ever born at all",Bye Bye Montreal
Amelia Curran,"At a quarter to midnight lays a cornerstone
You can read by the moonlight aloud and alone
And from over your shoulder it's courting your soul
Does it tell you your fortune or say nothing at all

In your dreams your montana skies
In your dreams your a ruby and sapphire prize
In your eyes something to see
In your eyes pastures of green

In the company quarter the company store
Stays making the bargain that it made before
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets bring that company down

In history wayfaring armies
Cavalries above and beyond
Some were made of mothers own babies
Some were made of mothers own young

In a small dark alley where the sun won't go
There's got to be something maybe diamonds and pearls
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets find that dark alley out

Oh mystery gem of the moment
Chivalry got lost in your smile
Some may say there's nothing to comment
Some may stay silent awhile",The Company Store
Amelia Curran,"All my lovers think I'm lovely in the morning when I wake
When I roll in folds of slumber when I caress I give and take
All my enemies are just like me they're a fatalist mistake
An abandoning of deities the slowest interstate

Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you
Catch her if they can

Oh and all the stars in heaven
Cannot count on me alone
For I'm a lovers enemy
And I can't be counted on

All my lovers under cover of night wrestle with their wounds
They're pawing sorrows piety they're kissing pleasures gloom
All my enemies are ready for a drink or two to spite
They're praying for forgiveness and they're ready for a fight

Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you
Catch her if they can

Oh and all the stars in heaven
Cannot count on me alone
For I'm a lovers enemy
And I can't be counted on

All my lovers love me tirelessly the listen and they see
They work the web of time itself to fall and capture me
All my enemies they envy every move I've ever made
The tireless love I gather even rain on my parade

Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you

Amelia Curran,"Hounds are broodin' in my bones
But I am a good dog runnin' halfway home
Hear the lonely promenade
Come to nurse the tender terrways

All hands on a grain of sand
Half smallest things are the high demand
I can only serenade
And wait my turn to burn or fade

All colors you can see
Cover the borders of a masterpiece
Time can paint the best of me
Over the unclear eyes of memory

Cover love from sympathy
Be my maker, set me free
Truer hearts could not contain
How I cover love but I have not changed

If I had the past undone
Then I would give my heart to everyone
Hounds are turning, doves have flown
But I am a good dog running halfway home",Hands on a Grain of Sand
Amelia Curran,"Julia queen of hearts
Pleads to play the part
The casualty of everything
The fatal arrow thru the lark

And the nightingale

Cannot contain what the don't discard
And it won't remain

Amelia Curran,"Wicked the weather can empty the heart
Sunsets are poetry falling apart
Pitchin' and weavin' down Gottingen Road
I never loved you I know

But dance with my shadow on into the bar
Midnight is marked by broken-down choirs
And the red face prophets are claimin' their fame
But I don't remember their names

Morning comes like a broken-winged bird
As though daylight delivers a miracle cure
And here in the pink of a dangerous day
Forgive me, forgive me, 
Those red-faced prophets, bartender and me.

Dancin' in riddles on top of dead dreams
I kissed a sailor, said he was the sea
But he never knew it from me

Amelia Curran,"When you abandon all manner of me
The concrete and angels' ashes
With nothing to serve but your own memory
Bring them the rain, the last of the tidings
Tied to the arrows fired off to love's lost regard

Lovers don't love you
And silver don't lead to your door?
Will you take comfort
That you have been taken before?

Oh, every intention has paved every path
They followed through driftwood and moor
What haunts you the most only lives to outlast
Cast off the best, the rest of all sorrows
Left to the gallows, the palace of all that you are

Have I been good to you?
Blue in the shadow of gold?
Blue in the phrases of letting go

Feeds you to love's long reprise",Love's Lost Regard
Amelia Curran,"Feast on the labor of your mind 
And you won't go hungry and you won't go blind 
Feed on the pictures of all you've left behind 
Knowing they are just pictures, still and sad and refined 

Its a mad world to be stuck on the livin 
And its a heart breaker, to succumb to forgettin 
I keep wishing for something that gets in my way 
And my path is a jungle, it's got too much to say 

Outlive me, outlive me 
I love you too much 
Rubies and emeralds, 
Sapphires and such 
Outlive me, outlive me 
I love you too much 
Coal into diamonds,

There is a fire in place of a stone 
Softens the letters and it takes you back home

Now tenderly questions the choices we've made

Amelia Curran,"Hello it's me the mistress
Is there anybody home?
'Cause the last place I should be is sittin' here alone
All I ask for is forgiveness
If you've got some give it here
You don't act much like you need it
You don't look much like you care

And will you need me in the summer?
Will you need me in the spring?

I believe my life is ending I don't know where to begin
I've got a page in my back pocket of the seven deadly sins
And its dragging me around among the needles and the pins

And I don't need to take a breather
I'm on the outside looking out 
Yeah, I don't need to see your papers
'Cause I know what you're about
You had me by the bible and you had me by the belt
And you had me from the instant my cold love began to melt
And then you praise me for my inspiration
Asked me for an explanation
Followed up with hesitation
Fit my primal expectation
I don't care but I don't mind
You can call me any time
You can holler through the fortress
And kick me out of line
I don't expect it from the grief that gathers in my head
I like suspended disbelief 
I like to spend the day in bed
I like to spend the nights in heaven
Hanging with the dead
You know, Judas and his women and the voices in my head
I've got my eyes upon the mirror
I've got my hands up in the air
I confess to my distress yeah, I great crazier each year
You know I'd change it if I could you know I like to say that I would
But there's a war between the parts of me
The evil and the good
And you try and stop me I'm on fire
It doesn't look that way
You know, I used to be a liar
But living's set me straight
I don't come with no disclaimer I'm like everybody else
We keep our demons on the burner and our morals on the shelf
And nobody asks for my opinion because you don't want to hear
I swear I'm only human wishing I could disappear
And you must think its an illusion that I like to live in fear
Of a probable solution of why the devil put me here
And now no judgement call will kill me
Just makes me close my eyes
And I sink into the slumber to the prison of my mind
Where I'd love to introduce you
If you found a way inside
You could sell me retribution and totally demystify
Until I wonder how I got here
Until I don't know who to be
Is it better to be grounded?
Is it better to be free?
Am I better off without you?
Am I happier alone?

Amelia Curran,"There's a crack in my memory,
As if something has gone
And split the foundation
Of shadow, of song

And raddled the windows,
And the tiny regrets
And the tiny glasses houses
That I tried to forget

Drink til your sleeping,
I love you that way
Like we are all babies;
All our beds are unmade
No memory has molded
Enough to forget
And our tiny glass houses
Are not built for us yet

Takes all of the courage,
And none of the pride,
To stand in the threshold-
To sit down inside
Where we are not babies;
No we are not new
And our tiny glass houses
With the beautiful view

There's a crack in my memory
Where a funeral parade,
Rolls through the doorway
That my memory made
And funeral marches
To its funeral sounds
And the tiny glass houses
Are all tumbling down

And tiny glass houses,
Are all tumbling down

We'll come together on the renegade road
Lead you back to the wreckage of change

Cross the river in three good strides
Left the company wild with pride
River ribbon all around your legs
Gripped the surface and you turned your head

Jump the line and turn the key
Lose your guard, believe in me
I can love you best of all
I am the wrecking ball.

Hallelujah changed your tune
The sky was open for you all too soon
Left the cradle in the rockin' wind
Ran from nothing like it's everything

Night can turn the mirror on
Saw your face and it looked all wrong
Where are the eyes that you looked out from?
Two young coins in the rising sun

So you curb and then the tragedy
You put your faith in a reverie
All good soldiers stand for thee
Losing battles in front row seats

As your shoulders curl and bend with time
Then love and hatred must combine
You turn the page to reconcile

The stars fade, the night shade falls and makes the world afraid

America,"Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe
And a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment when
He heard them holler, stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""
(Frosty)

Yes, he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea

The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing

If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free

Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you    I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea

So many dreams to wake

America,"On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
And after three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name

American Boys,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road

American Folk Singers,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

And we would sing along, got some records of 'Super Chunk And Hum'.
Knew it all along. We never get along.
I gotta try get you off mind but it never works every other time,
I heard canon ball it brings me back to you on my stereo.
Let cross some 'Sonic Youth'

To back the sound and what we dig,
Make it like when 'The Breeders' were big,
Everyone would sing along, sing along our favorite songs

I got a picture of a photograph of you,
Riding in my car playing 'Big Star'
It's never growing old blasted mellow cold.
Knew it all along we love the 'Sweater Song'

To back the sound and what we dig,
Make it like when 'The Breeders' were big,
Everyone would sing along, sing along our favorite songs

Make it like when 'The Breeders' were big,

Just catch me when I fall back to the ground

And this is the sound 
And this is the sound 

And this is the fall don't catch me if I fall
Just catch me when I fall
Don't catch me if I fall back to the ground",This Is the Sound
