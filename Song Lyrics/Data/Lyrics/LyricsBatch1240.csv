Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back

Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on

Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

The Singers Unlimited,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
The Singers Unlimited,"You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet
Not perfect yet but close enough for love

How old-fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day
When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story ever told
Not perfect yet but close enough for love

Not perfect yet but close enough for love

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I am not alone
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone

You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?",Everywhere [Instrumental]

To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

The Singing Nuns,"Dominique, nique, nique, over the land he plods
And sings a little song
Never asking for reward
He just talks about the Lord
He just talks about the Lord

At a time when Johnny Lackland
Over England was the King
Dominique was in the backland
Fighting sin like anything

Now a heretic, one day
Among the thorns forced him to crawl
Dominique with just one prayer
Made him hear the good Lord's call

Without horse or fancy wagon
He crossed Europe up and down
Poverty was his companion
As he walked from town to town

To bring back the straying liars
And the lost sheep to the fold
He brought forth the Preaching Friars
Heaven's soldier's, brave and bold

One day, in the budding Order
There was nothing left to eat
Suddenly two angels walked in
With a loaf of bread and meat

Dominique once, in his slumber
Saw the Virgin's coat unfurled
Over Frairs without number
Preaching all around the world

Grant us now, oh Dominique
The grace of love and simple mirth
That we all may help to quicken
Godly life and truth on earth

Dominique, nique, nique s'en allait tout simplement
Routier pauvre et chantant
En tous chemins, en tous lieux, il ne parle que do bon Dieu

First and last and always:til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine

Maybe it's not so easy
Maybe it's a way too long
Say, say you'll be by me
When the evidence comes along

(My calling)
(My time)

See a body and the dream of the dead days
A following lost and blind
Cross my heart with silver
Here's the key behind
Seems like twenty-five years of
Ever after, ever more more more
Seems I wore this face for you
Far too long before

First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of the end of time

In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom

And the pressure is all too strong

To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further

The Sisters of Mercy,"When it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly

Killing time but it's better
Than living in what will come
And I've still got some
Of your letters with me

And I thought sometimes
Or I read too much and I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow

And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane

Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

She said, ""Do you remember a time when angels?
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here""

She said, ""When days had no beginning
While days had no end when shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you were wild""
You were wild

Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name

And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true

And I'm walking through the rain
Trying to hold on waiting for the train
And I'm only looking for what you want
But it's lonely here and I think you knew

And I'm, and I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain

(no no no) No time to run and hide

Sometimes in the world as is you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you

It's not so hard to understand
It's just like always coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find
It's just like always here again it's...

Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can't sleep

No time to be afraid of fear
I keep no time to cry

Sold me name and innocence
Took my key
And told me to follow her
Down from igor with her bangles and her reference
One from the church from the valley of the
Well she wanted a haven and a place to hide
So I gave her an alibi took her inside but

A rock and a hard place await for for me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everything I ever did right or wrong
Hid out of sight where I belong, belong

And I didn't have the heart to tell her
Why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye but

Cause and effect go hand in hand with
The devil may care but I don't mind and I

Left her there that night but will she
Find me? I don't think so, no

The Sisters of Mercy,"And yes I believe in what we had but words got in the way
And only yesterday, as I was leaving, Lord knows I've tried to say
But I've heard a million conversations going where they've been before
Seen the way that careful lingers undecided at the door

And all I know for sure, all I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling, the heat inside
When bodies meet, when fingers touch

All my words are secondhand and useless in the face of this
Rationale and rhyme and reason, pale beside a single kiss
And I've heard so many things, I fail to understand at all
I'd settle anytime for unknown footsteps in the hall outside

And all I know for sure, all I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling, the heat inside
When bodies meet, when fingers touch

Because the world is cruel and promises are broken
Don't try to tell me anything, don't try to tell me
You'll be true to me, you know the real truth is never spoken

And I know the world is cold but if you hold on tight to what you
Find you might not mind too much though
Even this must pass away

And memories may last for years but
Names are just for souvenirs
Some kind of angel, let me look into your eyes

Don't give me why's and wherefore's reason or surprise
I don't care for words that don't belong

And I don't care what you're called, tell me later if at all
I can wait a long, long time, before I hear another love song

Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of angel come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful, beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful, beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful

We serve an old moan in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift...nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia
Mother Russia
Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls

When hanging from a tree 
It's a case of melancholy 
There's no tourists at the sea 
Twelve saw decaying monuments 
While marching on attack 
Eleven watched a single 
Thus continued on the march 
Oh, oh 

Pin point toward horizon 
Convalescent to the last 
A moment lost of imagery 
The last word to the cast 
Won't you listen to the danger 
I can't listen any more 
Oh, oh. 
This...oh, oh oh! 
This...oh, oh oh! 
This...to march along 
This...on undwelt seed 
This...is a panorama 
This...is a soldier's creed. 

From this came a stranger 
All the marching seemed to halt 
From this came a moment 
Then the march led to assault 
The dwellers took position 
While commanding genocide 
The enemy were helpless 
And there's lots more besides 
Oh, oh

Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance

Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me

Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me

The time was in the telling on the bank the scene was set
The sky was rolling blindly on, the daylight had not gone
She washed her hair among the stones and saw what was to come
All this will pass
There will be blood among the corn and heroes in the hills
But there is more to come my boy before you've had your fill
Men will come and rape the soil as though it were their own
And they will bathe their feet in oil as I have bathed my own

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Stones will stand together as if searching for the stars
And all come crashing down again before they reach too far
She turned to face the setting sun, I turned to walk away
But then she called my name again and beckoned me to stay

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

She told me of the famous sons who write their names in peace
Yet be cut down before the time has come for our release
Just as I tell you here
Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen

I listened for so long that day that I can hardly tell
If what she said was heaven sent or brought to bear in hell
That men of hope would stand alone and still be cast a lie
Just as Romans cast them on the day they were to die

All this will pass
All things must come

The Skids,"I walk through the debris of cardboard and clothes
Trying to work out where everything goes
I'm short of you and a book or ten
And I'd love to hear those Leonard Cohen songs again
You can keep the wok
'cause it matches the satellite dish
You can keep that crew neck sweater
I wore to the Talking Heads gig
I don't need that angry sex
I can find that for myself
You can keep that body
It belonged to somebody else
Self-help books and motivational videos
A ticket stub from the late night show
Nonessential items of disfunctional-eese
I don't have no room for those water skis
You can keep that kiss me hat
The one that I bought in Spain
You can keep my scalextric
And all of my clockwork trains
All that stuff I thought was good for my health
You can leave it all on the bathroom shelf
You can keep that body
It belonged to somebody else
A room a bed and a couple of chairs
Had a hard time getting that fridge up the stairs
Sitting by the window looking out at the rain
I would love to hear those leanoard cohen songs again

You led me where I had no sight
Till birdsong broke the morning light
And I was weak with strange delight

Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea?
I am new to mystery
I want everything laid out for me

All of history
All of history

You showed me walls around the world
Where seekers passed and flags unfurled
You wove a tale in silken curls
And blew the mist in silver swirls

Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea?

I want everything laid out for me

Beneath a darker sky
With innocence within ourselves

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

The Slapping Suspenders,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I turn around to see you. And if I do or not, it all depends.

Lived a while when you loved me,
Died a little when we broke apart.
Yesterday, it would have mattered.
Now today, it doesn't mean a thing.
All my hopes and dreams are shattered now.

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones

And passions just like mine

And then they lived and then they died

And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said

The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarize or take on loans

With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh

Ceiling shadows shimmy by 
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey 
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes 
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes 
My life down I shall lie 
Should restless spirits try 
To play tricks on your sacred mind 
I once had a child, and it saved my life 
And I never even asked his name 
I just looked into his wondrous eyes 
And said : ""never never never again"" 
And all too soon I did return 
Just like a moth to a flame 
So rattle my bones all over the stones 
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns 
Oh, see how words as old as sin 
Fit me like a glove

A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves, and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
It seems so unfair
I want to cry

You say : ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose/poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say : ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)

To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?

With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister ?

With a head full of plaster
Said : ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

The Smothers Brothers,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Snake the Cross the Crown,"I got your letter, but the willingness wore out,
And then penmanship was beautiful at best.
Your words were honest, 
But the meanings raised a doubt

And the sorrow to the ground
Breathe in, breathe out
You're taking in the good, 
You're living with the bad

But the latter seems to be more
Than it ever has before
And in between the sorrow of self-infliction
And your blood cells are burning to break free

And I think I might let them go
A pretty vision to follow through
You know it's hot and we can't take it
It doesn't look like we would make it,

So let's just forget,
You know it's hot and we can't take it
It doesn't look like we would make it,
So let's just forget

You're hearing one thing, it's always the same,
But the trick is holding on
Remember that glare, 
The one before everything comes clear

And it's harder every day to think of what to say
But the trick is holding on
And the time is making everything seem hotter
And there's no use holding on

And every day is more like science fiction(?)
And the past comes into play
A life with less emotion
And I know we both let them go

A pretty vision to follow through
You know it's hot and we can't take it
It doesn't look like we would make it,
So let's just forget.

You know it's hot and we can't take it

The Snitches,"You're like a cool breeze, on a summer's day
You are a river running through the desert plain
You are my shelter, from the pouring rain
You were my comfort, even before the pain

I can hear the sound of five drummers in the wind
The leaves blowing in the breeze, ring out like guitars
A tin can rolls across the gravel like a tambourine
I am but a vessel, so I sing, because you are

[Chorus]
In my head, you're always in my head
In my dreams, you're always in my head
In my pain, you're always in my head
In my peace, you're always in my head

A rainbow of rhythm stretches across the sky
An airplane in the distance, plays a beautiful cello line
It's no coincidence; it's in tune with the music in my head
If you were a shoulder you're where I would rest, but I am your vessel so I hear, you

Just yesterday.
Live was such a simple game,
A child could play.
It was easy then to tell right from wrong.
Easy then to tell weak from strong.
When a man should stand and fight,
Or just go along.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.

I remember when the answers seemed so clear
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.
It was easy then to tell truth from lies
Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate,
The foolish from the wise.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.

It was easy then to know what was fair
When to keep and when to share.
How much to protect your heart
And how much to care.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.

Work like the devil for my pay

Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray

The Sons of the Pioneers,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Greenfields
The Sons of the Pioneers,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Where the shadows have all the room
I was ridin' free on the old SP
Humming a southern tune

When a man came along made me hush my song
Kicked me off, way out there
As she pulled out of sight I turned to the right
A left and everywhere

But all I could see was a cactus tree
And a prairie dog playing there
I watched the prairie dog feed on the tumbleweed
That's his home, way out there

So I threw down my load in the desert road
Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun, make the tall shadows run
Out across that barren plain

Then I hummed a tune to the risin' moon

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Told me to get a grip of things
Like just buy a paper to follow up
The rest of the world on the other side of my fence

I see the world...
I figured there´ll be someone
Waiting for someone else like me
Someone that needs a break
Needs to catch up with the real world
Maybe that someone and me could meet
Maybe together we could explore the other side

The Soviettes,"I might not know just everything
But what I hear is that you kind of brought this on yourself
Well not quite you, but some before

And now he's keeping to himself, so send someone for your revenge?
Well maybe not revenge
It's been suggested that you're out to finish up your daddy's war
You say it's not okay for them to have enough to wipe us out, so why is it okay for you?
It seems to me that since no one's got their hands on anyone for what happened last year
You're using this as a distraction
If you stepped back a minute I would hope you'd see
It's better that you work this out yourself
I know you won't miss kids like us, but kids like yours will pay the price

Everyone's had a day like yours,
But you should know that you're not alone,
'Cause we'll be there with you always,
Call us up. Let's go!

I know when I go low,
I know where I can go,
Find those who help me,
And I find out why so,
I know it's hard to know
Exactly where to go
I find my way so no one else
Can feel left out (?)

And when you feel let down
No one wants to be around
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together

Some days are dark, I know.
That's why I think it's important to
Surround ourselves with friends who stay close
Feel stronger are along
Go on you always know that
If you need help I'll be there tomorrow.

No one wants to be around,
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together.

And when she doesn't come home you have to sleep alone
Then you wet your bed, and I think that's sad
For a girl of nineteen it's more than sad
It's obscene

And your girlfriend sweet little seventeen
She's got her layered hair, and her flared jeans
You know what that means?

She shares your London flat

Out my head by half past ten
Out with mates and dates and friends
That's what I do at weekends
I can't talk and I can't walk
But I know where I'm going to go
I'm going watch my money go
At the Locarno, no
When my feet go through the door
I know what my right arm is for
Buy a drink and pull a chair
Up to the edge of the dance floor
Bouncers bouncing through the night
Trying to stop or start a fight
I sit and watch the flashing lights
Moving legs in footless tights

I go out on Friday night
and I come home on Saturday morning

I like to venture into town
I like to get a few drinks down
The floor gets packed the bar gets full
I don't like life when things get dull
The hen party have saved the night
And freed themselves from drunken stags
Having fun and dancing in
A circle round their leather bags

But two o'clock has come again
It's time to leave this paradise
Hope the chip shop isn't closed
Cos' their pies are really nice
I'll eat in the taxi queue
Standing in someone else's spew
Wish I had lipstick on my shirt
Instead of piss stains on my shoes","Friday Night, Saturday Morning"

To be taught and to teach

As she watches the waves turn white at the tip

Radiating with joy
And luckily she still can't stand the sight of a boy
And lastly there's Dade
His hair dances in the wind
And he's wondering what love is
And why it has to end

And he can't understand
How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends
His mother whispers quietly...
Heaven's not a place that you go when you die
It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive
So live for the moment
And take this advice, live by every word
Love is just a hoax so forget anything that you have heard
And live for the moment now

As she waits for her real, first passionate kiss

Of her sister Veronica, and how she's so pretty (and how she's so pretty)

Still sitting on the dock
Ponders his life, and he skips his rocks
And he wonders when his father will return

And there's three, count 'em three
Children missing from the beach
They were eager to learn,
To be taught and to teach

But the sad thing
Is that they never lived passed the age of fifteen
Due to neglect from their mother
Who was bed ridden by her ex-lover, their father
She didn't even notice, or pay much attention
As the tide came in and swept her three into the ocean
Now all her advice, it seems useless

No, heaven's not a place that you go when you die
It's that moment in life when you touch her and you feel alive
So live for the moment
And take this advice, live by every word

Don't change your plans, this won't take long
I packed it up nice into this little song

If I could have your attention, observe this fuse
It leads to these explosives that I'm about to use
Before you freak out, just let me explain
This bomb is the answer to all of my pain

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that we never feel the heat, until we get burned
But we try so hard not to die
Sometimes we forget to appreciate life, oh no

When the spark reaches powder, I will blow up
I'll become the mist you breathe into your lungs
All of my love will then turn into yours
And you will feel hope bleeding out from your pores

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that we never feel the heat, until we get burned
But we try so hard not to die
Sometimes we forget to appreciate life, oh no

Dad, you were there when nobody was
I followed your lead, now I'm proud of what I've become
Britney, you never cease to amaze me
Maybe someday we'll get another chance to be
Mom, I wished you would try a little harder
Maybe catch a show or two, would that be such a bother?
To all my friends, where do I start?
I know I'd be dead without you in my heart

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that we never feel the heat, until we get burned
But we try so hard not to die
Sometimes we forget to appreciate life",Appreciation and the Bomb
The Spill Canvas,"In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty
I wanna be
In the warmhold of your Loving mind.

To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand,
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind.

When sundown pales the sky
I wanna hide a while
Behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing,
'T would make me sing,
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Diddy da da la da da da da da
Ya da da, da da, la da.

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near
To kill my fears,
To help me to leave all my blues behind.

For standing in your heart
Is where I wanna be
And I long to be,
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Take your silver spoon and dig your grave.

Lousy lovers pick their prey but they never cry out loud.

What became of your self-inflicted wounds.
And then the blood started running and a running right from your nose.

Teaming with echoes of situations.
I do not feel well, pressed beneath this spell.
Polishing my social skills,
With one more drink, and two more pills.
I do not feel good, I thought by now I would.

But then again.

Hoping I'm the only to frequent your dreams.

I can't take another breath without feeling the regret of my jealously.
Horrified that you might have really lied

Overwhelming proof. That you're nothing but a fake.

The Spinners,"In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, ""boy, hurry to Sunday school""

Filled with a load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie, well, well, well (living in the past)
Sometimes it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in a while, she would break down and cry

Sometimes she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh (Sadie) Sadie, baby
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) she'll love us all in a special way
Well, well, well (place no one above you) sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin', yeah

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) my, my, my, I love you, mama
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) I just can't forget
How you gave me love, oh, Lord (living in the past)
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) it's a mean world without you
All the love you showed
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh, how could anyone ever doubt your lovely word?
(Living in the past)
Ain't it funny that in the end, it's not money
It's just the love you gave us all?

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) Why, why do the good leave so soon?
(Place no-one above you, sweet Sadie) oh, I don't know (living in the past)
And though the people say they love my songs
Oh Lord, I'm all alone, I miss her so
(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) well, I love you, mama
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh
Let me just try, just try one more time and say, I (living in the past)
And though we were very poor, she tried to love us that much more, oh
(Sadie)
Have you ever, have you ever met Sadie? (don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh
The premier of ladies (living in the past)

Oh, sometimes I feel so alone
But I know that I gotta on
(Sadie) that's what she wanted for me
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) I know it's gonna be hard some time
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh Sadie
(Living in the past) lord, although my mama's no longer here
Her memory still lingers dear, ah

(Sadie) just let me run, let me run, let me go
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) why don't you?
Why you wanna make me feel so bad? (place no one above you, sweet Sadie)

The Spinners,"Some people say what goes around comes around
Don’t pick me up with love just to put me down
If this is true what they say, then why do they let love slip away?
So just give your love and I’ll give mine, yeah

If there are greener fields and a higher ground
Then what makes loving red change to hazy brown?
When love is put to the test, it somehow weeds out the worse from best

All I ever want from you
Is your tender love, you see, girl

See girl, I’m a simple man
Doing the best I can to make you see that I love you, girl
I need your love
'Cause living ain’t all, hey, hey 
I got to tell you about it
I, I got to let you know
Can we sit on top of the world?
Twiddle our thumbs just little bit
Just little bit, babe
Twiddle our thumbs just a little bit

Punished for a crime that was not mine

Papa did the best a man could do

Fancy fairy tales are bought and sold by those
Who can well afford time to make believe
Childhood dreams, can still come true

Guess it ain't my style to live in just one town
Still I'll never know why a child is blamed

The Spinners,"One of a kind love affair is
The kind of love that you read about in a fairy tale.
Like the sun that shines on a rainy day, it's a cloud of love.
One of a kind love affair is 
When your down is up, when your up is down,
But love stays around,
And when you know you're right, but you got to make a little sacrifice,
You make it for love. Who-oh-oh-oh, yeah.

I never thought about today would come
When she would leave without good-bye, yes, sir.
She wrote a line or two upon the wall --
Said, I'm leaving you, know I love you too,
I can't stay with you --
And this very day, I could never say a discouraging word.
?Cause I love you. Who-oh-oh-oh, yes, siree, now

(One of a kind) love affair is
When you hate to say girl I told you so, but you gotta go
There won't be a fight, ?cause your love is right,
But you're leaving wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

(One of a kind) Ooh (love affair is) Ooh yeah.
When you treat her nice but you finally have to pay the price.
And though you know you're right
But you got to make a little sacrifice,
You make it for love,

The Spinto Band,"I've got this notion
That moving out is better
Than this commotion
If she complains I won't let her

Tell me what to do
And if she wants to argue
I'll remind her that were through

A late reminder
And Post-it notes and marker
Were it not kinder
Her black eye would be darker

And all these brown boxes
Haven't helped me move one bit
In half empty rooms they sit

Stay that's where they will stay
I could never say
I would never say, ""This is over""

I've got this cupid
Humble from woolen sacket
It's pretty stupid but nonetheless I'll pack it

And this box cutter?s too dull
Other wise I'd end it all
There's still boxes in the hall

And stay, that's where they will stay
I could never place any other blame
And how could you even go
On living if it's so unintentional? I'd like to know

In love with someone else
And it doesn't really matter if she can't speak all that well
If she won't talk I don't care

'cause I don't wanna break your heart
Don't wanna let you go
I'm in love so whenever we're apart
But that don't mean I won't want more so

Give me a chance, I promise I will come back
Honey, this is a bitch I just have to scratch
All things considered, I'm not much of a sinner
But something tells me that I am missing out

Something about looking at you makes me want to blink
Like I'm scared of a man this big
But old jokes are just that, old
I guess, what should I expect?
What trite line will you give me next?

But I don't wanna break your heart
Don't wanna let you down
I'm in love with you so hear me out
All I want is to look around

I'm nervous when I'm near you
Oh, I've such a mind for this
'Cause it's a finite number of times
Before I catch the drift

But I don't wanna break your heart
Just wanna get you back
I'm in love with you so hear me out
How I just want to be your man
