Conway Twitty,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",Wild Side of Life
Conway Twitty,"It used to break my heart each time you cheated,
I tried to leave you, the Lord knows how I've tried
But I stayed here no matter how I'm treated
And all it really cost me was my pride.

But I don't mind,
I don't mind
I did for a time
But I don't mind.

You and I have a perfect understanding
You come and you go as you please
And I never get too angry or demanding
It's hard to get mad on your knees.

But I don't mind,
Baby, I don't mind
I did for a time
But I don't mind.

Once I was strong as a mountain,
I stood tall like a giant Oak tree
Now my blood runs thin like water in a fountain
You took all the man outta me.

But I don't mind,
Baby, I don't mind
I did for a time
But I don't mind",I Don't Mind
Conway Twitty,"The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
'Let my guitar playing friend do my request'

'Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die'

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, 'There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear once before you move along?'

""Sing me back home the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die""",Sing Me Back Home
Conway Twitty,"Skip a rope, skip a rope

Awwwww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.

Skip a rope.

Daddy hates momma and momma hates dad
Last night, you should've heard the fight they had
It gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream.

Skip a rope, skip a rope,

Awwwww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.

Skip a rope.

Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now, what was that they said about a Golden Rule?
Well, never mind the rules, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of their skin.

Skip a rope, skip a rope.

Awww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.

Skip a rope.

Stab 'em in the back,
That's the name of the game
And momma and daddy
Are who's to blame.

Skip a rope, skip a rope.

Awww listen to the children
While they play
It's really not very funny
What the children say.

Skip a rope, skip a rope.
Skip a rope, skip a rope",Skip a Rope
Conway Twitty,"First thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And the youngest dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leaving town not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but mama tried

One and only rebel child for my family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learnin', toward the bad I kept on turnin'
Till mama couldn't hold me anymore

I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause mama tried

Dear old daddy, rest his soul, left my mama heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

I turned twenty one in prison, doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause mama tried",Mama Tried
Conway Twitty,"Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving

And today I started loving you again",Today I Started Loving You Again
Conway Twitty,"With pen in hand 
You sign your name
Today at five 
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone

If you think 
We can't find the love we once knew
If you think 
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire 
To kiss me
Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had
If you don't think 
They out weigh the bad
Well then go ahead
Sign your name
And I'll be 
On my way
I'll be on my way",With Pen in Hand
Conway Twitty,"I have the reputation that's known throughout the land
They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man
They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun
They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun
But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad
It started many years ago when I was just a lad

I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three
So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny
I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day
Then I began to gamble to pass the time away
I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again
But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win

The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold

The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips
He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost

Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died
He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive
And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won
I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun
Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test
And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west",Bad Man
Conway Twitty,"The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer

I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass

Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm

Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil

Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like that
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks",Ballad of Forty Dollars
Conway Twitty,"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
Stands out in this memory I revive
'Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
To try to feed my mama's hungry eyes

He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't ?cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes",Hungry Eyes
Conway Twitty,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red
Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knoty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga",Kaw-Liga
Conway Twitty,"There's a table in the corner
Of a honky-tonk in town
And if you should ever want me
There I can be found

There'll be heartache all around me
And the blues for company
At the table in the corner
Where we once used to meet

There'll be two chairs at the table
But something won't be right
'Cause one chair will be empty
Just like my arms tonight

Same old faces all around me
Everything is still the same
But the table in the corner
We'll never share again

Oh, I know that I should leave you
And start my life anew
But that would mean I have to
Forget about you

And it's no use I can't forget you
So I guess I'll spend my time
At the table in the corner
With your sweet love on my mind",Table in the Corner
Conway Twitty,"I've been living a new way of life that I love so
But even now the clouds're gathering and the storm will wreck our home
I thought we belonged together that our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching from the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping and I wish that I had been
But it's best to get to know you and the way your heart can sin
For last night he hugged you tightly and you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching from the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started as I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly that our marriage was all wrong
Well I hope he makes you happy that you'll never lose his love
But I was wrong for I've been watching from the window up above
How I wished I could be dreaming and wake up to a love that's true
I was wrong for I've been standing at the window watching you",Window Up Above
Conway Twitty,"Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm is brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So take back the treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach",Crazy Arms
Conway Twitty,"Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean
So they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play

Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da la da da da

People walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
And they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da la da da da

Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity and you don't give a lot
Lotten da la da da da",Games People Play
Conway Twitty,"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay.

[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number,
Troubles by the score
Ev'ryday you love me less,
Each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number,
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting,
That's the day my world will end.

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way.

[Chorus]",Heartaches by the Number
Conway Twitty,"I'll share my world with you everything that I own
My earthly possessions there's no good if I'm alone
Let me bring you the sunshine when it's fresh with morning dew
Can't you see that I'm waiting to share my world with you
I'll share my world with you if you'll be mine alone
I'll give you a new heart you're the only one it's known
Let me give you my two arms they'll be happy if you do
Can't you see they are waiting to share my world with you
[ guitar ]
I'll share my world with you everything that you'll see
Divide all the memories one for you and one for me
Let me give you my two lips they'll be smiling if you do
Can't you see they are waiting to share my world with you




",I'll Share My World With You
Conway Twitty,"One for the money two for the show you've played your little game so cleverly
First you took my money then you made me go
You showed me up and made a fool of me

Not too long ago I still remember kisses warm and sweet and oh so tender
But like a boat of life that strikes an unconfected tree
That's just how quick you've made a fool of me
One for the money

Everybody told me what you were doing they all said that you would be my ruin
But like the tree that couldn't see the light that's flashin' down
I closed my ears and didn't hear a sound
One for the money",One for the Money
Conway Twitty,"Left a good job in the city a workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleep
While worryin' bout the way things might have been
The big wheels keep on turnin' Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis copped a lot of cane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
The big wheels keep on turnin'...
[ guitar - steel ]
If you come down to the river I bet you gonna find the people who live
You don't have to worry if you have no money people on the river are happy to give
The big wheels keep on turnin'...
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river




",Proud Mary
Conway Twitty,"If I never love again I won't feel cheated
You gave me more than I knew how to use
On the day we met my journey was completed
Even though my autumn years won't be with you.

Seems like yesterday we called each other darling
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand
I'd love to hear you say good morning darling
Oh, what I'd give to live those darling days again.

Today my heart survives on love that's borrowed
From all the happy yesterdays we knew
If I knew for sure the world would end tomorrow
I have to spend my last days loving you.

Seems like yesterday we called each other darling
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand

Conway Twitty,"Hey hey baby
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
Hey hey baby
I wanna know if you'll be my girl

When I saw you walking down the street
I said that's the kind of girl I'd like to meet

She's so pretty Lord, she's fine

And surprise you with a gift when I come home
Then mine forgetful arms will reach out for you
I can't forget you just because you're gone

I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
It's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me

I accepted all the reasons why you left me
I've gone back and relived all the love we've had
For every tear we lost I've found the thousands smiles

I'll come running to you

Now all my love belongs to you that's just the way that I feel
And if you'll give me the least little chance I'd show you my love is really real

Conway Twitty,"Just two kids from the country, far from any town
And wherever I played Rose could always be found
Life was hard but we made it and as everyone knows
I was there when she needed me, a playmate of Rose

Now years have passed, things have changed
Since we moved into town
The little girl I grew up with is your woman now I found

And now the sidewalks of the city where
Wild temptation flows
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose

So if you're the one that's holdin' her tight
Somewhere out there tonight
Please don't treat her as if she's just another girl
From off the street

And please, don't do her wrong
For her pride is almost gone
For you see Rose means the world to me

I love the girl you found out in the world
The girl that every man knows
But I love her today so different from your way
For you see, I'm the brother of Rose",Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain

But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still my dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you

I never once stopped believing
We'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you

I could have loved another but I chose to wait and suffer
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you 'till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you

Conway Twitty,"Reuben James in my song you'll live again
And the phrases that I rhyme 
Are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James.

Reuben James all the folks 
Around Madison Caunty cussed your name
Just a no count sharecroppin' colored man 
Who'd steal anything that he can
And they always laid the blame on, Reuben James.

Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James.

Flora Gray the gossip of Madison County died with the child
And although your skin was black 
You were the one who didn't turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name, Reuben James.

Reuben James with your mind on my soul 
And Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek 
There's a better world waitin' for the meek
In my mind these words remain from, Reuben James.

Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James.

Reuben James one cold dark day 
They brought you from the fields
And that lonely pinebox came 
Just a preacher me and the rain
To sing one last refrain for, Reuben James.

Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James",Reuben James
Conway Twitty,"Wish that I was on ole Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke up on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on ole Rocky Top
Part bear, the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from ol' Rocky Top

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Conway Twitty,"Just outside these prison bars
The hanging tree is waitin'
At sunrise I'll meet darkness
And death will say hello

Darling, touch your lips to mine
And tell me you love me
Promise me again before you go

Will you visit me on Sundays?
Will you bring me pretty flowers?
Will your big blue eyes be misty?
Will you brush away a tear?

A grave is filled with silence
If a sleeping man could hear
Darling, would I hear
Your footsteps up there?

Promise me that time won't
Separate me from your mem'ry
That you'll remember me
Until the days of silver hair

If not for you, I know
I'd lose my mind before morning
Hold me close and
Tell me you still care

Will you visit me on Sundays?
Will you bring me pretty flowers?
Will your big blue eyes be misty?
Will you brush away a tear?

If a sleeping man could hear

I thought I saw him smile in your direction

With ten minutes he had asked you for a dance love
Oh too soon you said you'd like it fine
I thought you danced too close to be strangers
Or was my imagination out of line

As the night grew old the wine had made you careless
It seemed to me that he was just your style
I said let's go home before there's some heartache
And you said your imagination's running wild

My mind was filled with cruel and painful vision
Afraid I might be wrong I tried to smile
Then you left with him and all my fears were happ'ning

A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in the winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man but you can do the job
When you're in town""

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in the winter wonderland

Conway Twitty,"Everyday your husband goes to work from nine to five
Wakes up in the morning and puts on his coat and tie
Sits down at the table with some coffee and the news
""Two eggs over easy,"" girl, that's all he says to you
The kids are all in school now and you sit home alone
Spendin' all your time down it the basement a-washin' clothes
Somehow this just ain't the way you dreamed love would be
I can look into your eyes and tell just what you need.

You need a bad boy
To love you up and down
A bad boy
To take you on the town
It's plain to see what you need's
A little bit of mystery
You need a bad boy
A bad boy like me.

Every night at six o'clock he walks on through the door
Lays down on the couch and throws his shoes off on the floor
Tonight was gonna be the night he took you to a show
Now he's much too tired and he doesn't wanna go
Once again you spend the night in front of the TV
In bed you turn to touch him but he's already asleep.

You need a bad boy

Conway Twitty,"You tell me that it's over
I'm just someone you think of now and then
And you say that you once loved me
But the love you had for me came to an end.

And you tell me that my memory
Is just a dying ember not a flame?
Well, you can call it what you want to
It's still love by any other name.

Call it what you want to
I still bring out the want to in your eyes
Every time that I'm around you
The desire that surrounds you just can't be disguised.

You can call it anything at all
But what you're telling me don't change a thing
You can call it what you want to

Conway Twitty,"HARD ACT TO FOLLOW
WRITERS DAVID CHAMBERLAIN, GARY NICHOLSON

My leading lady is gone
And it's so hard to go on
Without the part she played
My life's just an empty stage.
She's a hard act to follow
I thought I'd find somebody by now
She's a hard act to follow
Her leavin' brought the whole house down.
She was so right for the part
The way she fit into my heart
After the love she gave
Who could ever take her place?
She's a hard act to follow
I thought I'd find somebody by now
She's a hard act to follow
Her leavin' brought the whole house down.
She's a hard act to follow

Conway Twitty,"Imagine a world where no music was playing
And think of a church with nobody praying
Have you ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

But, I've run out of reasons to defend your alibis
I can't go on pretending everything is still okay
Now, I know the truth behind all the games you've played
It wouldn't be so hard for me to turn my heart away
If I didn't love you.

Looking back, it's easy now, for me to understand
Why you got so angry when I asked you where you'd been
You told me my suspicions were only jealousy
And, you used the way I trusted you to make a fool of me
You closed my eyes to lies that I could never have believed
If I didn't love you.

If I didn't love you
I'd have walked away a long, long time ago
If I didn't love you
I never would have let you hurt me so.

Now, the time has come for me to tell you that we're through
Leave this broken dream behind, and go find someone new
I can see that it would be an easy thing to do

Don't let me cross over.

Lord knows I've tried to think of my lover.

But it's nowhere to be found
But that's how it is in lonely town

Conway Twitty,"Well, I was working this joint in Dallas
To make the payment on my car
Just a weekend stand with a local band
They had me playin' rhythm guitar.

Well, I was singin' some old cheatin' song
When this blue-eyed blonde came by
She said, I'm a table over in the corner
Why don't you drop around and say hi
So, I did.

Well, she was dressed like a million dollars
But she was way up outta my class
She whispered into my ear, honey I hear
A honky tonk man moves fast.

All of the sudden my body went numb
I had enough sense to see
That everything I ever wanted in life
Was coming to easy for me.

So I said, ""Wait just a minute,
Wait, just a cotton-pickin' minute.""

You better not get caught in the desert
Without your snake boots on
You don't lay down on the railroad tracks
'Til after the train is gone.

You don't swim out in deep water
With your pockets full of stone
You don't get caught in the desert, son,
Without your snake boots on.

Well, she was quicker that a boys good judgment
So, we were headed for the parkin' lot
When a guy in the band said, ""Wait a minute, man
Lord, are you crazy or what?""

""Well, ole big bad Tex is her lover
And, he's terribly skilled with a knife
He's real particular 'bout who rides his horse
And, nobody fools with his wife.""

So, I said, ""Wait just a minute,
Wait just a dang minute.""

Like walkin' on a high wire, Lord, it scares me half to death 
You're always high above me and I'm always fallin' down 
Our love's just a circus baby, and I'm just the clown 

And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to 
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around 
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown 
'Cause our loves a circus and I'm just the clown 

Everyone's in love with you, but they just look at me and laugh 
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act 
Ah, but someday when it's over and we bring the big top down 
You can say it was one big circus and I was just the clown

And only been in love a night or two
They see a beautiful woman in the shadows with a man
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous

Lovers lyin' low
We must be deceivers
'Cause baby they don't know

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves

I've been fallin' for you for years
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong
It's been goin' on and on and on and on for years

You make it easy to be a one woman man
Just look at you sitting there
Your eyes are talkin' in that soft and sexy way
Sayin' let's slip away, slip away somewhere

It don't take a rainy night
Or music in the dark
But baby when your body sends
A message to my heart

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves

Conway Twitty,"We step out on the dance floor, the band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

Time standing still as I whirl you around
We're dancing without even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

No words are spoken
That don't need to be said
You and the music
Have gone to my head

But I'll just go on when the music is through
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you

Conway Twitty,"Some say love, it is a river
And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose",The Rose

I was green as government ink on a twenty dollar bill
I signed a lot of papers, didn't know what I had to lose
Make no mistake about it, now
You can't be too white to sing the blues

Some folks make it fast down here, some folks make it slow
Learning how the hard way taught me everything I know
When that old highway is your teacher

A country boy can get confused
But one thing I know for certain
You can't be too white to sing the blues

I've learned how to whistle, I've learned how to lose
I've walked a mile in everybody's shoes
Well, you can laugh out loud if you want to
But you can't be too white to sing the blues

Someday when I'm old and rich and I don't work no more
I'm gonna find myself a rockin' chair
And I'm gonna sit on my front porch

And as that old sun is settin' I'm gonna howl at the rising moon
Well, you can go out rockin' now
But you can't be too white to sing the blues

I've learned how to whistle I've learned how to lose

With nothing but these memories of you
Staring at these walls that are closing in
Wondering if you're ever coming back again

Why is it always after someone's gone

In my soul emblazoned and blue

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;

The passage of time sure has been good to you
I was tempted for just a moment to run out in the street
But what do you say when two old lovers meet

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn’t let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory

When I get home, I know what I'll find
How I wish that it wasn't so
There'll be no one there to hold me tonight
In that house on old lonesome road

I recall how we laughed
When we read the name
In the paper before we moved in
And after we did our friends all asked
If that house was lonesome back then

We were so young, our dreams were so new
There's just no way that we could have known
The irony of the place where we loved
That house on old lonesome road

And a case of worn out stairs
Just like my old heart they need repair
Maybe I should sell it
Yeah, maybe that would be the best
Maybe then someone else could find
Some love at that address

I used to love that old house so much
Back before she went away
Now everything there is just gathering dust

Conway Twitty,"I was there to buy a pistol. She was there to hock her ring.
The broker in that pawnshop deals in almost anything.
He'll pay you for your misery 
or he'll sell you someone's pain,
And that twinkle in his greedy eyes says your loss will be his gain.

She stood back in the shadows as the broker dealt with me.
Her eyes were dark and desperate from some private misery.
His word was so prophetic when he said, 
You've got a steal.
I said, ""Throw in one bullet, and you've got yourself a deal.""

All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.
Just hand the man the money, and if someone's got to die,
The broker in the pawnshop won't even blink an eye.

He handed me the pistol, and I was almost to the door,
When I heard him tell the lady, ""Seven dollars, nothing more.""
The lady started crying as he took her wedding band.
My hand was in my pocket, and the gun was in my hand.
I had planned to use that bullet on myself, to end my life.

I was once somebody's husband. She was once somebody's wife.
I usually mind my business but I could not walk away,
His dollars just weren't making sense, and I knew I had to stay.
The broker's face turned pasty when he caught my icy stare.
It would never leave my pocket, but he knew the gun was there.
I asked him what his life was worth, and he opened up that drawer.
For a simple golden wedding band, he paid two thousand more.

That Saturday night was special even though it wasn't planned.
As we walked down the sidewalk, she reached and took my hand.
We crossed a bridge, and I took that gun and sailed it through the air.
I said, ""Ever been to Texas?"" she said, ""I think I'd love it there.""

You know it's alright I've got time

You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush, baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love, you want a slow hand

You want a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time with you baby

Conway Twitty,"I woke up crying late at night
When I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
Had passed away and gone.

My world revolved around him
I couldn't lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door.

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't want to cry anymore
So may I stay with you?""

And he said ""That's my job,
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you,
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Later we barely got along
This teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
Were over different dreams,
We each held for me.

He wanted knowledge and learning.
I wanted to fly out west.
Said, ""I could make it out there
If I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
Who will pay my way back home?""

And he said ""That's my job
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Every person carves his spot
And fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
Light as bright as he.

Woke up early one bright fall day
To spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
Within a mile or two.

I make my living with words and rhyme
And all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
As bits of poetry.

But I say ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?""

That's my job, That's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.",That's My Job
Conway Twitty,"Play, guitar play
Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling

Look a-yonder ya-all who's coming
Down the road, he's a coming home
But they know I never will
I left them living with that awful thing I done

I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run
Play, guitar play
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar, before I go

We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord I wonder if they know

Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We got to climb that distant hill

I wonder if they think of me

Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
She's gone, I'm alone, 
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date

I searched for a simple way 
To tell her what I had to say
I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date

Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know 
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize

So blind I couldn't see 
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be

Yes, I know that I once loved her and I placed no one above her

Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises 
Surprised me and said goodbye today

And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away

She sways and the jukebox plays on and on
It's into the music, she's gone

A word to help take the hurt away
I feel what she feels as she sways

Someone let her down, oh, I understand
Me, I'd be happy just holdin' her hand

Her dream was only a dream, that's all

Twisting her hair, staring out into space
There's no talking to her, don't even try

Her head is spinning like a carnival wheel

She's got all the symptoms, she's showing all the signs

Can't seem to fit 'em into her new world

Even harder understanding why she needs him so much
She's not herself when he's not around
Why he's even got her thinking 'bout settlin' down

And tried to find
Just where our love went wrong

Conway Twitty,"Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess 10 years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty two
Joni I just can't wait for you

Soon I left our little home town
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But her words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni, I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

You came to me and you threw me, with a simple goodbye
I begged your forgiveness, but you won't even try
You just say that it's all over, that you'll soon forget
But I still remember, I'm not through loving you yet

She just told me that she was gonna to leave me and that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the loving kindness and the understanding that she had when I first met her
Is still there, somewhere
So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way

And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that you're gonna leave me 
And do things you've never done before

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises 
Surprised me and said goodbye today

And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away
I know you believe you don't love me
Before you walk out that door

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore",Touch the Hand

The passage of time sure has been good to you
I was tempted for just a moment to run out in the street
But what do you say when two old lovers meet

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You're doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein? alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn't let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory

You say, hello

How are you
You're doing well it seems

Came by today to see me and

With him and Billy on a hike

And there's one thing I'd like to do
And maybe if I asked him to
He's sit and talk to me man to man
We'd only be gone overnight
And I could find out what it's like to play

From her son of seven years
He didn't know she'd read between the lines
He'd never really known his dad
And although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his mind
She searched her mind in desperation

Too late now I find I care

I searched for a simple way 
To tell her what I had to say

Conway Twitty,"Don't you like the way she talks to you
When she's feeling woman warm
And don't it make you feel so good
Just to know she's yours all by yourself

Don't you like to see the sun go down
When she's lying close to you
And can't you feel her all around
And when she loves you ain't she something else

Chorus:
Ain't she just some kind of lover in the morning
Can't your arms feel the warmness where she slept 
Ain't she just all that you have ever wanted
And when she loves you ain't she something else

Don't you like the way she clings to you
And loves you 'til there's nothing left
Now tell me don't her lips taste good
And when she loves you ain't she somthing else

Lord, When she loves me she's sure something else",Ain't She Something Else
Conway Twitty,"Somewhere between her blue eyes and jeans
There's a heart, that's been broken
Along with her dreams.
And tonight she's out dancing
Drinking and thinking
Feeling a feeling,
Between her blue eyes and jeans.

She looks just like an angel
In a big ole cloud of lonesome
Reflecting her memory
Round a golden wedding ring.

And tonight some dance hall doctor
Might break the chains that locked her
To that lonesome old feeling
Between her blue eyes and jeans.

Somewhere between, her blue eyes and jeans

Conway Twitty,"They all reach to touch him
As he walks out on the stage
They came to see the legend
And to hear the legend sing

While the men sit there applauding
Ladies love him with their eyes
And he looks just like a legend should
Up there in all those lights

But they don't know, after the show
How fast the legend fades
How he reaches for the bottle
When guitars are put away

And the photograph of the love he had
Fills his trembling hand
There's a lonely world of difference
Between the legend and the man

He's won all the shiny statues
All the records pressed in gold
But he lost what really matters
What he really wanted most

And tonight in some big city
Lord, he'll drive the crowd insane
They'll feel the pleasure of his songs
But they won't feel his pain

'Cause they don't know after the show
How fast the legend fades
How he reaches for the bottle
When guitars are put away

And the photograph of the love he had
Fills his trembling hand
There's a lonely world of difference
Between the legend and the man

Down lovers lane we were walkin'
She said, ""Honey child, do you love me?""
Right away I started talkin'

Is a bluebird blue?
Has a cat got a tail?
Hmm, is a blue bird blue?
Well honey, I love you

Well, I held her close and kissed her
Then, I looked in those big green eyes
She said, ""A hey boy, do you love me?""
I said, ""I wouldn't be at all surprised""

Is a bluebird blue?
Can a big wheel roll?
Hmm, is a bluebird blue
Then honey, I love you

Well, she finally believed my story
Said, ""Baby, I understand""

And you'll be my big lovin' man

They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.

And as I read between the lines
I began to realize

He didn't know I lost you
A long long time ago
Oh, I, just can't make it any longer
Everything I do is always wrong

Lord I'm just living a lie
And there's no need in trying
To keep hanging on
After all the good is gone

Lord I wish that I could die
And there's no use in trying
To keep hanging on
After all the good is gone",After All the Good Is Gone [Single Version]
Conway Twitty,"Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

The bottle is almost empty
The clock just now struck ten
Darlin' I had to call you
To our favorite place again

We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fire's gone out at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot

Each time we say is the last time
But we keep hangin' on
And there's nothin' cold as ashes

Conway Twitty,"I pinch myself when I wake up each morning
'Cause I'm constantly amazed when I see
Exactly everything I've always wanted
But I can't believe she gives it all to me

Lips that warm my face with morning kisses
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly
And love that always satisfies completely
But I can't believe she gives it all to me

She gives me more than any one man deserves
I who have everything am nothing without her
Somehow she knows I need her desperately
I can't believe she gives it all to me",I Can't Believe She Gives It All to Me [Single Version]
Conway Twitty,"I talk to the man in the moon.
I said, ""Sir, is she coming back soon?""
He smiled and he stated,
""Son, I'm over-rated,
I've had to much credit in those old love tunes.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love.""

Then I asked him ""Where is she tonight?
You must see all things with your light.""
He said, ""Son, I could tell you things that might kill you,
But I don't get involved in what's wrong or right.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love.""

He said, ""I can move oceans when I take the notion.
Or make mountains tremble and rivers run dry.
But in all matters human, remember there's someone
In charge of those things way above you and I.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love.
I don't know a thing about love.""",I Don't Know a Thing About Love [Single Version]
Conway Twitty,"I pushed him away
And carefully said
I'm just not that kind of girl

You might think I'm square
'Cause you've been around and you're wise
In the ways of the world

I know that making is taking for granted
It's all easy come, easy go

And girls with old fashioned ways
I still believe in love songs
In the good, in the good ole days

I've always liked happy endings
Somebody's dream coming true
I still believe in Waltzes
And dancing the last one with you

He slipped into bed, I turned over and said
I'm worried you working so late
Is it just your job that keeps you away, Lord
I know the temptations are gray

I'm just a wife, I'm just a momma
It's not too exciting I know
He pulled me close and whispered those same words
He told me that night long ago

Conway Twitty,"As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see

Darlin', don't say a word, I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine, you're tired of fast moves
You've got a slow groove on your mind

You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love, you want a slow hand

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey, we're drifting free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darlin', don't say a word, I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine, if you want all night
You know it's alright I've got time

Conway Twitty,"See her there, see her crying she thinks she loves him so
She don't know how much it hurts me to hear her beg him not to go
If she were mine again I'd never let the tears fill her eyes
She don't know how much it hurts me to see an angel cry

Once she built her world around me and like a fool I tore it down
And she begged me not to leave her just the way she's doing now
Now she's begging to another with that same hurt in her eyes
She don't know how much it hurts me to see an angel cry

I didn't know how much I loved her 'til she turned and walked away
I didn't know how much I'd hurt her 'til I say her here this way

Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling
Look a-yonder ya-all who's coming
Down the road, he's coming home
But they know I never will

I left them living with that awful thing I done
I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run

Play, guitar play
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar, before I go
We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord I wonder if they know

Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We've got to climb that distant hill
I wonder if they think of me

'Cause she always was the gentle kind
She's hoping I'll hear it from a friend somewhere
She's hoping I'll read between the lines

So watch her untie the ties that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

She's already gone except in body
It's just a matter of time
Well I should have seen the storm clouds gathering
But he who won't look is just as blind
So there's only me to blame when my woman drops my name

I don't want you to take this the wrong way

Came by today to see me and

With him and Billy on a hike

And there's one thing I'd like to do
And maybe if I asked him to
He's sit and talk to me man to man
We'd only be gone overnight
And I could find out what it's like to play

From her son of seven years

He'd never really known his dad
And although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his mind
She searched her mind in desperation
Six long years of separation
Dimmed the words she knew she had to say

And as I put my arms around you

Conway Twitty,"I woke up crying late at night
When I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
Had passed away and gone.

My world revolved around him
I couldn't lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door.

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't want to cry anymore
So may I stay with you?""

And he said ""That's my job,
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you,
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Later we barely got along
This teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
Were over different dreams,
We each held for me.

He wanted knowledge and learning.
I wanted to fly out west.
Said, ""I could make it out there
If I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
Who will pay my way back home?""

And he said ""That's my job
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Every person carves his spot
And fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
Light as bright as he.

Woke up early one bright fall day
To spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
Within a mile or two.

I make my living with words and rhyme
And all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
As bits of poetry.

But I say ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?""

That don't really matter at all
Cause you are here with me
Right now and you're

You're so fly
Baby you've caught me eye
Baby I can't deny I wanna try
To make you feel me like I'm feelin' you
You gotta know someplace where we can be
Just you and me so we can see
If this thing was meant to be

I know it's no coincidence or just by chance
We crossed each other's paths
Somehow somewhere we just connected
It's a simple fact that I'm content

Being here with you
I'm feelin' your style your smile
Your deep conversations
There's no regrets you should know that
Baby let's get outta here so we can do what we gotta do

See it's time to make your move
(I been checking you out for a while now)
So what are you gonna do, ohh

I don't care as long as we're together
Having you next to me giving me extacy, you're

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
It's bout that time we got the tunes
Hot on the block sippin' on 'yac like some damn fools
Consumin' liquor by the ounce
Ya guys is rollin' up to get their grub on,
wit the dubs on and the car that bounce
Help at the park, barbaques wit roasted pig
And can nobody eat until the meat is done and we feed the kids
Nieces, nephews, uncles and aunties
Yea, you ride wit plenty of folks but ain't got nothin' up on these
Seeds from the weed, up out the bangs of optimos
A bunch of pimps, playas, and hustlaz to fock the hoes
Pros comin' off, when the barbaques done
ain't really focus on that, but hell a playa bound to get some
Kids runnin' back-and-fourth cryin' on who pushed them now
We all fam, but I be damned if they push my seat down
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown

Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Hook: be	-12]
M-dub, three thugs sittin' on duece dueces
Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices

[Verse 2: Coo Coo Cal]
Midwest is the timezone
When it gets hot,
We go block-to-block, open up shop, and get our grind on
Now I ain't lyin' homes to whoever make a playa change
To release the tension, mention basketball and play a game
Wit dames on the sideline cheerin' you on
And haters that can't play on the side while,
cryin' foul, screwin' you on
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

A lot of them cut the top, hookin' up decks and sounds to roll to
It ain't the old two-hundred twenty twins
Mack-10, boss jackin' at the lakefront in the city I'm in
Bendin' corners in an orderly fashion
Twenty cars deep,
creepin' up the street, beatin' dawg so it be mashin'
Flashin' bread at them chickenhead
Yea they jumpin' in to sin dawg,
'cause-it's-about the only thing that'll get 'em fed
Hear what I just said
Pick 'em up in the presidential rento limo, TV's and (?)
Ghetto celeb is the gear we wear
Naw ya'll don't hear it there
But by the end of this year you gonna feel the player
Sippin' on Henn, and Cris is gettin' plenty drunk
Which switches from the candy-coupe dawg, an empty front
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

Cookie Coleman,"The first night we met
a chill was in the air.
We kept each other warm.
Woke up to a different world
covered in first snow.

Somehow I knew
our love could never last,
it came too easily, 
then vanished like a dream,
faded with first snow.

From the first snowflake falling
my heart keeps calling you.
If you're wondering where love goes,
it melts like first snow.

Now every year
when cold November comes,
I still remember you.

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

[Chorus 2x] 
I had the strangest dream 
I was in this place called butta 
You wouldn't believe what I seen 
Ooh  you got that butta 

My name Cool Breeze I got that country crock 
All the girls on the block they call me chop  chop  chop 
I cuts em up baby and my cuts be very precise 
And  uh  right before they melt  i put em back in ice 
And every now and then I take em out for a test 
Then it's back to the cooler to make sure they stay fresh 
They always scream my name at my heavyweight bout 
I like grits, girls raised in the South 
Hanging out for a night and she'll never forget 
How I showed her respect and I'm a East Point vet 
She stay on Old Nat'l, she wants to see me today 
And when she see me tonight she gon be college parkay 

[Chorus 2x] 

OK, first let me tell you how I tell how I tell 
When i first walk in the room I check for the smell 
And if it's on and popping I won't be saying nothing 
We can begin on the sofa where the parts jumping 
I know she telling all her friends about this butta she get 
And tonight she gon submit to the greatest hit 
Now we done done a lot of talking and enough has been said 
Girl get up on this toast and let me see how you spread 
I said paper, scissors, young cool cutter 
Toss em up in the air and cut em up like butter 
She said she never heard of nothing like that in her whole life 
That's when I pulled off my shirt and then I took out my knofe 

[Chorus 2x] 

Take you to get yo nails done, play that song ""The Player's Ball"" 
Run you over Kiesha house, drop you off by Greenbrown Mall 
It don't matter how long you try to keep me out 
I'm a still chop and dice you up like we were at the Waffle House 
Girls always asking me like what do I mean 
When I say butter berry cream when I'm floating downstream 
See this type of butter ain't like Land-O-Lakes 
it's just moist in the middle like some hot pancakes 
When I go over her house she always sitting alone 
And be playing my songs, I mean like all night long 
If i, Cool Cutter, gave one reply 
When I wake up in the morning, my cholestorol high

See where I'm from I was taught that
Two wrongs don't make a right but it'll damn sure get your money back
So best believe you got's to watch folks
You hit cho' lights, they have they face off in yo place
Just like a cockroach
Tryin' to hit chu' for yo index
Tear some paper out the back and re-arrange your whole contents
That's why you gotta keep yo history
In a book so when they look it'll never be a mystery
I've seen people come and leave, comeback and leave
Come back and still ain't stack no G's
So everybody won't be pushin' buttons
Just the ones who gave they all when you know they didn't have nothin'
We comin' what chu' gonna do when we run
In a pack against a pit and lay up under the sun

See growin' up is like a girlfriend
Ya keep ya cool, take ya time, and when ya day come you put it in
That's a reflection on ya whole life
From the moments you wake up to those minutes that you pray at night
Like when they pushed you at the playground
And all ya friends would wonder
Why you yelled 'the field' before you threw down
 
That's just yo instincts tryin' to tell ya heart
That is ya mother wished the best for you
You'd be tested it from the jump start
So that's when people come around and wonder
What make you tick, how you do it, but you keep ya business on the under
I ask my folks question every season
They say the Lord blessed every child, boy he blessed you with a reason
So with that I go for years and years
On a quest to return and reveal to my peers

[Chorus]

What if yo life story was in a book
And they left certain words that only you could say
Because they knew you looked
That's like your future bein' planned for you
You know who real and who fake and who ya friends and who gon' be loyal
You keep yo thoughts on a level
That don't nobody know what chu' be doin' next
Cause you change like the weather
You the chosen, the one who reveal
Every battle that we battled and every hill that we build
Your life is their forever burnin' torch
So the messages you carry reach and travel importance
See in the book you was this place that people actually lived
They disappeared in the mists of the hemispheres
But when they return they speak of travelin' on their journey back home
We shall rise once again and let it be known

Cool Breeze,"Hey, I remember when I came, came
I didn't have to ask nobody in the streets
To scream my name, name
'Cause we got a lock on this whole city
And got a key to the Dirty South
And the South coast, now play with me

So bring your semi thirty, art thirty
If you put your hands on a Calhoun player
It's gon' get dirty, dirty
And everybody trying to claim boss
But that's just talk
You don't really wanna turn these mics off

They trying to slick us with our own slang
Using our words like back and forth
Just calling us up out our name
See and for that they gonna pay, pay
Everything they did in one week, I'ma do in one day

You can say that it's about to start
Don't call us rappers
'Cause nowadays a rapper ain't considered smart
So I just stay away from those haters
And anybody in my clique who roll with me, you a creator

So it's like, who do you believe in?
Just like the hustler came back once
The clock is gon' strike twelve again
And I'm most requested in my old hood
From Martel to Springdale and all through Club Candlewood

You can ask Cool Cane or Dre-High
Either Po-boy, Dirty Red, or they gon' cut? I'm fire, fire
And they consider me that raw, raw
And your partners where you represent
They say you got that flaw, flaw

And Cool Breeze, he got that hard, hard
And ain't nobody taking nothing
And don't want nothing to start, start
So when I'm riding through the hood, hood
They respect me when they see me
'Cause they know I got that good, good

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

And can't nobody touch my team, team
Just like EJ from Southwest ATL
My partner got that green, green
And we gon' come through kicking the most game
Taking fo' sho' routes and pointing out the lane, lanes

So when you come and you ride through
It won't be no mystery, who everybody listening to
That's right 'cause all we do is stack, stack
And Organize this Noize and everybody know that

Plus we testing out this new sound
Everybody done put down
Now we breaking up some new ground
'Cause we serve 'em up that real, real
And be forever Dirty South in this place we live, live

That's what make the brothers hawk, hawk
Trying to step up and showcase
All that is is talk, talk
See Cool Breeze, he ain't your fool, fool
So don't ask me no questions
Like what makes me so cool, cool

They'd rather see me in the Chain Gang
Than rolling a V-12, riding on them thang, thangs
I get respect out to Alabama
To the West Coast to the East
Then right back to Atlanta

And that's how we keep it tight, tight
I come through busting the door first
Then we ship it out the same night
So when I'm riding through the hood, hood
They respect me when they see me
'Cause they know I got that good, good

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good

Hey, I was introduced to fame by way of mouth
I was rappin' on this tape, and the rap was about
How for my folks, and for mine, I forever stay down
And represent this town, and for that, I'll be crowned
It's been known that my attitude'll reach it's peak
That's right
But never has it once stopped the way that I think
I know the speakers addin' bricks to the path you lay
And to be is to live everything you say
I read once that if you die, the people couldn't forget
That your eternal flame will forever stay lit
One day I'll leave this place and add another star to the sky
But all of my creations, they never would die
I told you dirty jed clampett tried to front me some weight
This time he pushed me in his house, and had it laid on the plate
He had stacks of it packed all down in these crates
Stampin' bdf, nothin' but that flake
See, the only way the southcoast will ever become
We gotta all come together, and become as one
When they say ""what's your name?""
We say ""where you from?""
When they ""what you say?""
We say ""come get some!""

Run with me, and see if I give a fuck though
Wicked when I kick it, most expected to do dope flows
Underground, treasured by the ones who listen to it
Respected in the field by them soldiers who really do it
I'm on the frontline, moral for the troops
Makin' niggas lace their boots, and hit they mark when they shoot
Lord forgive me, but my people must defend their people
It's gonna take mass destruction just to see we all equal
Forty days and forty nights, we gon' fight and get wreckless

That Imma be big in the south like buffalo wings 

And I been blowing up the spot since the single came out 

And I'm starting to make a lil money it's getting hard to count 

And if I carry any with me it's in a small amount 

And I keep the rest in a stash by my auntee house 

So check the internet for when I hit your local stages 

of the the dirty south pages under south coast phrases

Cool Crooners of Bulawayo,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine (Cabanga)

Yeah, you're my friend, and when we're lost I'll still
Hold your hand
Revealing white when the shadows fail
And any shadow that you can name
I'll be the shadow of your name...

Hold the prize close to your heart
Prizes made for those who fail
Hold the prize away from you, so maybe you can hold me as well

And whatever's left of you, you'll be my dream

Cool for August,"I crawled out of my skin, looking at my pain and self
But it seems I've fallen in denial
The truth I admit, something I long to find
And it always comes in denial
The longest I lived, and sectioned the river passes through
And the margins way hours, half past tomorrow
And I will hanging from the line, and my head in magic
Take you to another time, like a child that passes away
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Life is what you imagine, powerless descent
And I've lost myself
The future is certain that the rain will divide us
Will a new shade that will force it's way out
Half past the silence
And I will hanging from the time, with crashes and province
They can see right and come to find, why the time has carried me away
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world

I hope I'm wrong
By step by step....

Destroying my youth
And the other side's the same
When the rain pours

Taking life in another way,
Contrived in the words they say,
Keeping time with the wolves at prey and I hope I'm wrong
I hope I'm wrong

Cool for August,"Faded lens and broken scar, feels no compassion
Pale blue car with tales of gold, in the wrong direction
And I stand the prison floor, my thoughts are changing
Locked in silence, and I see forever now, there's nothing left of you
Time has crashed again, fading promises remain
And the times that pass have changed, needless conversation makes me
Crazy
And I can't seem to find that looking glass, of you
When the ages come and go, like sees the passage
The empty threat has poised us all to see the madness
Just hand the table flow, his ever hand to guide the soldiers
As I try reason it all, calling out to you
My eyes crashing blank, visons of you have betrayed me
Try to pass the mate, knowing if all that's he's missed and hated
And I can't seem to find that looking glass
Maybe that's only made to last
When my fingers and thumb start to scatter fade
Of you... of you
Time has crashed again, fading promises remain
And the times that pass have changed, needless conversation makes me

Maybe that's only made to last

Taking a train to nowhere looking back at the past

As a world that I love to hate

Saved by a little realizing and a whole lot of pain
And all the time that I spent
And all the time that slipped away ain't over

Three people torn to pieces from a child's past
And the tears like rain pourin' down this broken face
It was all that I could take

The bonds that surround my home, they look like flies

And the time that you hate to walk away
Because the time that you regret, you walk away
They say that I live like a dog, but I think I'm bitten
A kitchen full of nothing, but there'll be something soon
I see a light above me, could it be my angel?
Could it be my love, to keep this struggle on

Bring me away to something I cannot hold

Breaking through the pink horizon
Winking at the sun and flying home
And I don't mind the weather
'Cause my seats aren't made of leather
If my car would keep on going
I could sing this song forever

I can't drive forever

And where they'll go
They'll go

That they should be poised
And ready to
Kick the window

And I found myself
In a field one day
I'll stop the car
In rainwater

Lighting all things unseen
And wisping me away fro You

From fleeing, familiar

How sweet the face
That I long to touch with dirty hands
I'm seeing sideways
Because I've fallen down again

But never turn to see their origin

You would bow to me and even die
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Who Am I?
Who am I that you would bow and put your knees to dirty ground?
Who am I to meet the king and have him wash my soiled feet?
You met me here, whispered in my ear
Now I melt into you (x2)
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Jesus, I feel you changing me

This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is I'm sorry

And I ate everything momma put on my plate
Niggaz walked around packin be	-be	 guns
Knock on yo' door and run, just for fun

We went to the sto' and sold bottles fo' a nickel
To feast upon a big bag of Cheetos and a pickle
You could get a soda foe less than quarter, and
People used to speak even if they didn't know ya

We fought in the streets like little black soldiers
Shake hands, and still be friends when it was over
We used to play tag and, hide and go seek, or
Hide and go get it if we had a few freaks, but

Now thangs changed, kids ain't the same
They bang, and slang, and blow out brains
I wish I could go back but, wishin is for suckers
Life was so simple then

I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh
When we used to hang
On the porch, drinkin brew
And now they drive-by (bay-bee)
I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh
When we used to play
Shoot-em-up, up and down
But now they gang-bang (bay-bee)

Well I remember yesteryear like it was yesterday
Runnin through the streets of Onessa P-A
I take you through my childhood step by step
Daddy always told me to maintain my rep though

Daddy was a dawg he ain't raise no punks
In the midst of the trees we learned how to thump
At the tender age of nine momma put us on a plane
Next stop -- the land of the insane

Compton California where the killers grow
Forced to live a life that I didn't know
Wore the wrong colors cause I didn't know the facts
Call her bitch, caught a case, caught a slug in my back

But I adapted quickly, suckers tried to get me
Now the fools better run cause this just driveby Billy
Little black boy from the East
Forced to be a killer, but I can still remember

I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh
When we used to play
Domino, on the porch
But now they drive-by (bay-bee)

I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh
When we used to have
Army fights, in the smog
But now they gang-bang (bay-bee)

[Coolio] Back when I was a kid nigga
 We used to have this game called paperball
(Paperball? What the fuck is that?)
 Get a piece of paper, ball that motherfucker up
 and play with it! Hahahaha

I got Tha Alkaholik juice to wake ya up like a rooster
Back when I was young, I used to be a booster
Stealin candy from the sto', go to school, come up
I had the whole playground, chewin all my gum up

You know what I'm sayin? Playin still to the chest
And I was the best, playin kickball at recess
I play Pop Warner, golden pairs for the losers
We used to hop corners on the fresh deuce cruisers

Playin Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin Reese's
I had all the women cause my tough skins had creases
And it's been that way since day one
Girls of the world ain't nothin but fun

I used to watch Dr. J, come through in the clutch
Remember New Zoo Review, and Starsky and Hutch
I remember lunchtime, we used to rhyme out loud
Peace to the Wop and the hip-hop crowd, I remember

Ohhh, my life, no no
I do remember ohhhhhhhh
I know you do
I remember yesterday

I remember when we played
I remember yesterday, aoowwwwwww!
I remember, hell, when we used to play
In ghetto blocks through the dark

I rememmmmmberrrrrr

We used to play dominoes all night long

Coolio,"Back in the days when I was a young buck
Stuck like a truck gettin shit outta luck
Times was rough and I didn't have a plan
I was barely on the edge of my life as a man
It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib
No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids
That's why a young nigga learned how to steal,see
Shopliftin laid me a whole lotta meals
But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and
Life was unfair but who the fuck cares?
I still hear Momma,what she used to tell me
That you don't get shit in this life for free
And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top
Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop
Not everybody can relate to what I been through
Even though some front and they try to pretend to
Know about the life of a kid and the strife
Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe
Good goes to bad,bad goes to worse
And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse
So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes
I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky
My stomach is growlin,word is born
'cause all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn

BRIDGE
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
I tried to get full off a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen

A few years later,I pledge a legions to the set
I'm growin up but I ain't grown yet
It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain
Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain
I'm sittin in the restaurant,guardin my food like a eagle
Pickin up scraps like a seagull
Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip
So I can put it in my pocket
Phoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork
We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork
And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how
When it come up I let you bring me down
So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group
Of gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'
Give me liberty or give me death
'cause a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh
And now that I'm older with kids of my own 
I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone
Get'cha self together,word is born
'cause a man can't live on a can-o-corn",Can-O-Corn
Coolio,"Once upon a time in a land called fuck 
Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck 
Mickey Mouse wore a rag  pants in a sag 
Neighborhood kingpin  but his brother was a fag 

Donald had beef  so Mickey couldn't sleep 
They was hootin' for a while  and it was gettin' kinda deep 
Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots 
Known to hit a five from a mile with a shot 

Goofy was Mickey Mouse right hand man 
One day smoked a stick, and came up with a brand 
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago 
A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald 

But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G 
Had big time respect, from the West to the East 
Haps up see, and listen to the funk 
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Huey and Duey and Louie with a 
Shot down Mickey Mouse made .. Minnie 
Everybody know Minnie got shot down 
And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound 

Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog 
Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog 
But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify 
Pixie and Dixie just did a drive by 

On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed 
And now Bugs Bunny is gettin' kind of pissed 
'Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer 
Bugs sellin' drugs on the motherfuckin' corner 

The future's lookin' shitty in fuck city 
So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy 
Shit's on the street, no that's how it goes 
Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead 
Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head 
Huey and Duey and Louie got caught 
And now they in the county, ready to sell out 

Pixie and Dixie's on the run from the mob 
'Cause they tried to kill Donald and they didn't do the job 
Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin' drunk 
Bullet fucked up Beetlejuice, while Miss Piggy had a pump 

Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin' 
So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen 
Goofy was a punk and everybody knew 
Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin' brew 

In the alley out back, in the corner in the dark 
But they both got smoked by Jabberjaw the Shark 
Donald Duck got the whole damn city sewed up

Coolio,"One dark night I need some ends
I got a spot cased out I'm breakin' in
I gotta cutter that'll cut through ya window like butter
Suction cup, window up
Now I'm on the inside lookin' for some loot
38 special I don't want to have to shoot
I ain't no young, raw fresh recruit, uh
Steel tote boots, black khaki suit
A real quick search and nobody's home
Just like I planned, now I'm home alone
I hope ya don't mind if I use tha phone
And fix me somethin' to eat before I'm gone
I got the servant and the china, deuce-five and the 9
Rolex off the desk so I can tell the time
No one knows where the flow goes when the 'dults crow
You better take some no doughs
Now I'm out tha back with a sack fulla goods
Throw it in the truck, take it back to the hood
Let me be brief, I'm on the creep
I stole the sounds out'cha jeep, it takes a thief

Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin' thief! It takes a thief
Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep
Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin' thief! It takes a thief
Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep

I need a lick real quick-like
My mind ain't wrapped tight
I scale like Mike Tys so call this fright night
You don't want to see me comin' down the street when I'm broke and it's dark
So run your motherfuckin' pockets 'fore they find your ass dead in the park
Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers
No I ain't the cops, I just want your rings
And your wallet and your watch and your fat gold chain
Don't try nothin' strange or I'm blowin' out'cha brains
I rob from the rich so I can get rich
I ain't got shit so I take what I can get
I need my mail, my snaps, my dollars, my ends
My grip ain't high enough so I'm robbin' on my friends
Somebody out there's out to get me
The smaller the nigga, the bigger the gat be
I don't give a fuck about your pain and your grief
You shouldn't of fell asleep, it takes a thief

Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin' thief! It takes a thief
Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep

There's a buster on the West Side, I heard he gotta grip
And he's outta town on business so I'm schemin' on his shit
I heard he got ki's and Gs and deeds
And guns and big trash bags full o' weed
I stole a brand new fresh shaft telephone van
So now I guess I'm the telephone man
The bathroom window ain't got no alarm
I gotta skeleton brick that works like a charm
It didn't take long to find what I was lookin' for
I was damned near finished when I heard a key in the door
I jumped in the closet and checked my clip
Pulled my ski mask down, I can't believe this shit
I counted to five and the front door opened up
I counted three more and the front door was shut
I counted five more to give me some space
Then I jumped out the closet and bucked him in the face
I loaded up the van in broad daylight
'cause Looky Lou's have their high beams on at night
I take the backstreets to avoid the heat
And never let em see me sweat, it takes a thief

Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin' thief! It takes a thief
Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep
Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin' thief! It takes a thief
Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep

Oh yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Hey yeah!
Just a reminder to let you know
There's motherfuckers out there that want your shit
So you better watch out, better watch your back
Can't be goin' to sleep, protect your shit

Coolio,"Verse 1: Coolio
Hey baby, how you doin? What's goin on?
I'm sittin in my motherfuckin cell, it's the same song
Tell my kids that I love em but don't tell em that I'm through
Keep cryin and tell em I'll be home soon
Oh baby I'm goin crazy
'cause I keep seein shit that amaze me
Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep
I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya
but I can't, so fuck it
I'ma behind these bars and it's burnin like nitro
I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle
Aw shit, there the lights go....

(Hello)

[Chorus]
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn)
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know)
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer
but I love dat nigga

Bridge: LeShaun
Hey ba-by
What's happenin honey?
How you doin?
I miss you

Verse 2: LeShaun
The kids keep askin where's their papa?
I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers
It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself
It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help
Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black
and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back
Damn, the pressure's gettin hot and heavy
and yeah, I'm gettin sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy
But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas
The ends don't justify the means
and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams
But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin end
but a bitch can't even trip like she doen't have a friend

[Chorus]

(Hello, you have a collect call from...)
Coolio!
(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now)
*number dialed*

Verse 3: Coolio
What the fuck you mean you need a friend?
I can't be havin no niggas round my kids
Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker
and start killin motherfuckers, SHIT!
I know it's rough, I know it's tough
but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up
You better stay away punk ass bitch, he ain't shit
I don't want to have to kill him
'cause think about the times that we used to have
Don't make me reach out and touch that ass
You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster
Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers
You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque
Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books
Peace

[Chorus]

Verse 4: LeShaun
Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas
now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do?
My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92
Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick
'cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip
And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you
He got evidence he never presents to
the people in court, I heard witnesses abortin
What's he doin about gettin you out to hold the fort?
I got some ends, I'ma send you a dime and two doves
Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta

[Chorus to fade]","Mama, I'm in Love wit a Gangsta"
Coolio,"5:30 in the morning and I haven't been to sleep
A pair of raggedly ass ProWings on my feet
Ten dollars in my pocket and now I'm on the creep
to the double-up spot 'cause the shit is comin cheap
It's 1984 and the rocks is all fat
Southern California, LA is where it's at
I'm smokin like a motherfuckin choo-choo train
Big cocaine inside my brain, aah
But nobody knows that I'm on the hype
Use to be in CREAM, well now I hit the pipe
Face sucked in, yellow tooth grin
No bitches, no friends, no ends to spend
I'm stuck like a rat in a sticky ass trap
and I sold everything but my motherfuckin gat
I got a habit like a rabbit and I want to stop it
but I can't 'cause I'm locked 'n da closet

Bridge:

Oh make me want to holler, right into my life 
Oh make me want to holler, right into my life 
Oh make me want to holler, right into my life 
Listen homey

No rehabilitation, no wantin to talk to...
Doin crimes on every fuckin place I can walk to
I still get props in the hood when I stroll by
'cause niggas don't know that I'm smokin like Popeye
Mama's in the kitchen cookin rice
Daddy's in the pen doin life
Sister gotta husband, she's a wife
And I'm in the backyard hittin the pipe
It's been three or four months since I started usin
It's a uphill battle and now I know I'm losin
I go to the spots where my face ain't familiar
and I cook here jack 'cause I don't know these niggas
I'm livin like a peasant and it ain't pleasant
I think I need to change my direction
I got the five dollar piece now I'm all in the carpet
in the dark 'cause I'm locked 'n da closet

Chorus:

Someone's knockin at the door, somebody's ringin a bell
Somebody's locked n da closet, somebody's goin to hell
Do me a favour, open the door and let em have it
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah

One year done passed and now I'm lookin dusty
Disgusted because my own mama don't trust me
My sister's on the trip 'cause she knows I'm on the hit
And I can't take this shit
There's a rumour goin round that I'm puffin heavily
and my neighbours is lookin at me crazy, G
I guess they figured out that I broke in they house
and stole all they shit while they was out
My sister told my aunt and my aunt told Pam
and Pam let it slip to that bitch Roxanne
Roxanne told Bill and Bill told Duke
Now the whole hood knows that I play the flute
But before I lost my respect
I didda lick your dumb ass on a jet, SHIT!
Now I'm back to life, yeah I'm back to reality
Ain't no side effects or technicalities
There's one thing about it when your life is fucked
At the bottom the only way to go is up, aah
No more cocaine bitches
I kick the door off the motherfuckin hinges
I'm out the closet *screaming*

Chorus:

Someone's knockin at the door, somebody's ringin a bell
Somebody's locked n da closet, somebody's goin to hell
Do me a favour, open the door and let em have it
let em have it

Someone's knockin at the door, somebody's ringin a bell
Somebody's locked n da closet, somebody's goin to hell
Do me a favour, open the door and let em have it

Coolio,"Verse 1:

I know a place where the trees don't grow
Just another place where niggaz live low
I know a place where life is fucked up
Make a wrong move and your ass get stuck up
Time ain't nothin but a frame of mind
And life is like a mountain or a steep ass climb
I've been lookin for a place to leave
The only free place is inside of me
So let's take a trip, and you don't need a grip
But you better be equipped cause it might be some shit
African-American, nothin but a nigga
Had our fingers on the trigger, but I pulled mine quicker
I know a place where there ain't no calm and
You better stay away if you're soft like Charmin
South Central, Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton
A nigga on the west coast on his way to Harlem

Verse 2:

Now it's time to step into the light (Light)
Put up your dukes, there's gonna be a fight (Fight)
And when it's time to fight, you better fight right
Cause if it don't fight right, out goes the light
Take a close look at what I'm freakin on
Niggaz think I'm tweekin, but I'm speakin on
Subject matter, data
Information that I gather
Through my travels
Cause the hardest of the hard, hit hardcore killer
Can't stop the slug of a nine millimeter
Everybody thinks they know, but they know not
If they haven't caught a cap on the block *gunshot*
So shine up your boots and pick up the pieces
Grab a fresh pair of khakis with the sharp ass creases
Ring the alarm, here comes the storm
I got a firearm on my way to Harlem

Verse 3:

I know a place where the sun don't shine
Everybody is a victim of neighborhood crime
I know a place where niggaz walk the line
One false step and they must do time
Since I'm in the same boat 
I must stay afloat
And sing every note
From the quotes that they wrote
So, I look into the past and walk the path of the greats
So I won't make the same mistakes that sealed my ancestors fates
If I had to be a slave I'd rather be in my grave
If I get in how many lives could I save?
One, two, three, a hundred, a thousand
My heart is poundin, the devil keeps soundin
But he don't want my money, he wants my soul
So I reach like a tree, and like a weed I grow
My stomach is full, but my mind is starvin
Rollin in a g ride on my way to Harlem",On My Way to Harlem
Coolio,"Brainiac, with a zany act, cleptomaniac
Before I go to work I smoke me a fat sack
Of indo, then climb through the window
And eye the VCR, and load it in the Pinto, huh!
Yes I'm on my way to the bait
or should I say the pawn shop, but I don't smoke rocks
Some people say I'm crazy and they think I'm on crack
Cause I hock all the shit and I never get it back
Coolio loco, you better call Bronco
Stole a link from my auntie, and sold it to my uncle
Took the flowers from a hearse, romanced a nurse
Put the girl to sleep then I went through her purse
Bandit, underhanded, yes I'm skanless
Snake in the grass fool, I'm taking chances
If the price is right, you can call me a killer
Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Finger

(""But he's stickin you, and takin all of you money"" -- Guru)
(""I ain't never got gaffled like that"" - JD)
(""Don't, you blink, or I'ma rob your ass blind"" - Sticky Fingers)
(""What you doin stickin in that people's window?"" - Richard Pryor)
(""Gimme that..."") big fat dope sack
(""Gimme that..."") ca-di-llac
(""Gimme that..."") big gold chain
(""That's the life, a-that I lead"" -- Run-D.M.C.)

Coolio call me shady, janky, slick right
You and your crew better duck from my gunshots
I takes no shit, carryin no drama
If I can't get you I bust a cap on your momma
I never had a grip, so I learn how to shoplift
My trenchcoat is long and now I got some fresh shit
Yeah, buddy, sht's lookin good
Gets much props and respect from the hood
Caps from my raps and a trunk full of hubcaps
Step to the crew, and you're bound to catch a pimp slap
But I don't pimp no bitch for my dough
They got somethin I want, I just rob the hoe
Early birds catch the worm so I crow like a rooster
They follow me round the store because they know that I'm a booster
Tell me what you want and I'll be the stealer
Call me Coolio, or call me Sticky Fingers

(""Coolio..."")
(""First they do' ring, now they mob ring"")
(""Told you before, you shouldn'ta never fell asleep"" - Big Daddy Kane)
(""Give it up, give it up, give it up"")

I don't want to go to jail cause I don't like the lockup
Turn out the lights and get ready for the sock up
One plus three equals four for the knockout
Got circles on that ass like a Mike Tyson PunchOut
You better hide your shit if you want to keep it
I'm driving down the street in your 'llac while you're sleepin
I was born with a sickness, that they call brokeness
Never said I was the best, but I'm damn sure the loc'est
Up, up, and away, like a rocket
Some fool got shot, now I'm goin through his pockets
He won't be needin no dollars where he's goin
And when I get to hell I'ma act like I don't know him
I'm takin everything that ain't bolted to the floor
And before I go I steal the knocker of your front door
Let me be free for I'm a thief and a gangster
Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Fingers

that a ho is a ho wit a toe-up slut so
if you're gotta have em, might as well be a fine one
but it seems that some niggas can't seem to find one
So they go and get a bitch that's lookin like Trixie
and Hekkyl & Jekkyl wit some saggy ass titties
A big fat flagrant hoodrat hooker
and the nigga got the nerve to pretend she's a hooker
Sportin that down from your arm like a Simpson
Talk about bitches that you wish you was pimpin
Come around the homies and you swear that she's playin
But everytime I see her, you're beggin
Go get you a girl that got somethin goin
Get rid of that bitch that's lookin like a dragon
Now you want to fight 'cause you're baggin on your Mrs
But that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches

Chorus:

When I was young I used to have fun
fuckin with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave em alone
'cause I went from rags to riches

They say 'beauty is skin deep' but goddamn weeded bitch
look like buckwheat mixed with opi
Toe up, toe up, straight from the floor
and her bad ass breath is about to make me throw up
Niggas started dissin and you blamed it on the gin
but the very next day you was with the bitch again
Now your ass is gettin clowned like Bozo
but that's what you get for fuckin with that ugly ho
I don't know what possessed you, nigga
Stand that hooker in front of a trigger
Spendin your time with a big goony-goo-goo
To niggas like you I gotta say ""Choo choo""
Dig a ditch down in desperation
Send that monster on a permanent vacation
The girl is chop-top, but you don't listen
'cause some niggas like fuckin with ugly bitches

Chorus:

When I was young I used to have fun
fuckin with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave em alone
'cause I went from rags to riches

Interlude

Aw shit, there go my nigga pretendin he don't see me
Talkin with a bitch that look like a flea G
Holdin her hand as he walks through the plaza
I try to play it off but I couldn't hold my laughter
The girl is done so take her ass off the oven
Put her on a BOOM and send her back to the covent
Cookin up a plan in a big, black cauldron
And the dumb ass nigga don't know that he's fallin
into a trap 'cause now the whore is pregnant
9 months later and she's squirted on an insect
He don't want to claim it, she went and got a test
Now he's sendin child support in a big fat cheque
My nigga got depressed and he started drinkin liquor
One night he got drunk, went to her house and killed her
Riches to rags and rags to riches
but that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches

Chorus:

When I was young I used to have fun
fuckin with ugly bitches
It seems that it's sad for this pussy I had
came from some ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
fuckin with ugly bitches
It seems kinda sad 'cause this pussy I had
came from some ugly bitches

Then when you shake that ass it's always amazin'
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches
Then ya gotta give a nigga his props
I got sides in my rides and motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to get the party open
Slide, slide but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

It seems nowadays
Just to get some respect
Ya gots to roll a Lex and collect a fat check
Or come around the corner on 3 Hobbit
Blockin' up the street
Flossin' back on your keys
An' everybody's sayin' you're the man loc
Never broke
An' high off that pream old smoke
Sippin' in the seat
Rollin' in the ragtop Chevy '63
The p.i.m.p.
On top of the game
But now you're gettin' laid
'cause that gak weed o' yay is playin' tricks on your brain
You're lookin' for a way out
Before your game play out
'cause once you game play out
Ya lose all ya' kriz out
Late one night you was rollin' down the block
With a half a pint of yat and the twenty dollar rock
One-time got behind you and they told you to stop
But you kept rollin' 'cause ya said you wasn't broke
Out like a sucka
You dumb mothafucka
Now the chase is on
An' here go the song
How the hell do you think you can run
When the helicopter light's as bright as the sun

-Chorus-

Lockdown since the '80 situation number three, a
Nigga is released from the penitentary
Fools betta recognize
An' visualize
Don't be surprised
Ya betta realize
They gotta plan fo' your ass, a
Cage for the mask, so
If you're rollin' dirty ya then ya betta have a stash
Spot in your whoopty
An' know the whoompty whoofty
When the whoompty whafty is done unto you, see
He don't know the new game
be	'cause the new game ain't true game
Well he betta catch her quick
Becuz the old game is runnin'
Nine is his waist
That's the new game loc, 'cause
If you ain't heated then you might get smoked
He was walkin' down the street
Mindin' his business
Just happy to be free
And what do we see?
From the corner of his house
Here come one-time
So off he dashed
Like they set fire to his ass
'cause if he get caught
It's strike number three
An' this might be his last day on the street
I bet next time you'll listen when I tell ya son
That the helicopter light's as bright as the sun

Coolio,"I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby, get in, we fixin' to cruise till we can't
You got the drink, I got the denk, and we done stopped at the bank
Sunbeamin' this weekend; heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair; one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin' to the beat; feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me, so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine, and we gon' have a good time
To the outskirts of first, buzzin' off the erky jerks
Swoopin' while I puts in work; now watch me skirt
I heard 'em callin' me, but then I ball and see
'Cause if you're ballin' me you got your own set of keys
The breeze is hittin'; don't think you'll catch me strippin'
Forty Thevz Wino and gat got that back when we're dippin'
To the west coast, down south in your direction

Hand him the jizz back, clowin' up the coast like that
Tangaray all nice in back seat, pete
Just do a rollin', top down, ready to hit the street
Shoulder to shoulder, turn their heads, 'cause it's a black thing
Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped; won't be no jacket
Consider that chocolate mixed with that tie
Wind be on my neck; the beach caress my thighs; now I hope he's high
Ready to get my groove on, so I'm playing teams
Know when he's feelin' me and what those feelin's be
Kinda' flossy, 'cause, Tossy; we do it on seat tip
Snuggled up, freaky dick give the drink a sip
Leaning on his chest, I feel security
Just my man and me, against the world; you understandin' me?
Cruisin' till the sunsets; yep, we'll be headin out
Dippin' through the city, me and my niggys; what I'm talkin' about

Sunday afternoons in the tape deck
My woman's on the right, lookin' bomb for this trek deck
Floatin' on the freeway at a cool sixty-five
Malika rolls the top, so's I can feel that rocky mountain high, yeah
Take the wheel while I shake off this hairbrush
Yep, I'm down the bus like no one like what
Watchin' the sunset; be the flyest with the top down
Park up at the spot; I ain't gonna front; I'm tryin' to mess around
Your homies still around
Yeah, they busy though
That's all I need to know; roll up the windows, and lock the door
It's all that poppin' on that cooze got me worked up
Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some
Yeah, that's how we do it on the western hemisphere
All my homies be a man, 'cause ain't no pretendin'
Cruisin', feel the wind blow my braids back
Trippin off into the night, bumpin' to a fat track, yeah

Coolio,"Now I didn't use the word bitch a few times in a rhyme, but
Now it's '95 so let me drop a line
This goes out to the young black queens
On the neighborhood scene
Who haven't lost their dream
I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love
And to get where you go ya got to push an' shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Do his five in the purse an' five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to momma
The only kind you ever let get past the drama
Coolio know that you ain't no ho
And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat
Queen of the entire universe
And you know how I know that you were put here first
An' to every nigga that dissed ya an' every nigga that hit ya
Accept my apologies for my brothaz....

My...sista...
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need...



Princess of the Nile
An' sweet black sexy child
Ooh I like your style, huh
First motha on the planet
I know it's gettin' scary
And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet
But ya gotta shake 'em off like fleas an' nigga meat
And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matta where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn
Brick house with a face like Leena Horne
I ain't no cap to save a ho
But I got your front
An' your side an' your back if that's what ya want
So when it's time to put it down I won't be runnin'
Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubmanm, huh
No matta what ya do or where ya go
Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio....



-Chorus-



Hernie Dipp got the lips, finga tips, and the hips
Ta make mice outa the crazy-ass Bloodz and Crypts
Make a nigga sing a song all night long
Til' his voice is gone
Wit' no music on
You can be a busta on a hardass low
An' should be down wit' your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh
Every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, 'cause
When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way
Wit' no hesitance
An' any type of the leg
I talk about my granny
Batana, an' Vanita
Jacki an' Nicole an' Grandy an' Artisha
I gots to give credit where credit is due
An' all credit that is credited is credit to you
I give praise to your wayz
An' for all my day
Apologies much respect to the sons I raise....

Coolio,"Steppin' up out the shadows I comes equipped to wreck 
Hold up just a sec Coolio I'm on deck (Malika) 
Yep the diction is on point 
'Causin'  friction when I flex up the jaw to hit the joint 

That can actually give a blood mob like Gotti 
Like the body cool  keep the strap up by the naughties 
Niggie trippin' why you beam us I don't step up with no bullshit 
See that there it's clip for this stickup on the hip 

Peep the correct way to get your pimp on 
Let me hit the bong oh and my mind's quite strong 
Wreck it nice and proper if it's on I'm finsta to stop her 
If I'm swingin' for the knockout, best believe I'm fits to drop her 

Ninety-five's on poppin', representin' I keep stompin' 
Throw up my fists just like this when I'm mobbin' 

I killed the last, killed the ass, with my ninety-five drive 
I'm deep like Denzel with my Crimson Tide, nigga 
Like Chaka Khan, I tell you something good 
I'm Hi-see like Spike Lee within Tales From the Hood 

You need it, I'll feed it, baby check the size 
Have you Goin' Down like Mary J. Blige 
When it's poppin' like this, you can't be a coward 
Shorty freaks fuckin' beats like Adina Howard 

My squad is hard, with players, and hustlers 
No toleration, for fakers and busters 
Fuckin' with me with all honesty 
You get bombed rap songs comin constantly

Killin the competition, while making a fuckin' green 
So ring, around the rosie, and mosey to the Rosie 
And I want you to know G

We bust and cuss and kick up dust 
Don't none of y'all niggaz want to fuck with us 
So what's the time? It's time to get real 
Why you bust your rhyme? Cause I got skills 
We bust and cuss and kick up dust 
Don't none of y'all niggaz want to fuck with us 
So what's the time? It's time to get real 
Why you bust your rhyme? Cause that's how I bail 

Watch me, swallow this nickel and shit five pennies 
I'm the loc'est of them all though the rat is kinda skinny 
How many linny and squidgy think they can see me? 
I'm from Compton where even in the summer niggaz wear beanies 

Bustin' lyrics sharper than razor blades catch it from head to toe 
if you're shocked, then amazed, when you see me at my stage show 
For my stage show beat em up 
40 Thevz gettin' busy rockin' coast to coast 

Dogs the most rap the hoes then rocks em up 
Givin' it up for hip-hop vicitims how should I drop em and then pop em 
for poppin' like to get what I got, and I ain't got a whole lot of 
Nothin' 

'Cause I been ruffin' and scuffin' so give it up when I'm bustin' or get to duckin' 
'Cause I ain't given em nothin' 
Fools can't get none, so fuck em! 

Let me rock the motherfuckin mic 
Smoke a whole stick of dynamite, then fight all night 
I got jabs like a welterweight champion 
The pocket-pincher purse-snatcher pistol-packin 

quick to get it crackin' 
Went from jackin' to rappin' to runnin' with a pack of mad men 
Pull a trick out my sleeve like Aladdin 
Some fool tried to play me for a punk I had to have him like 

Lunch or dinner, he's just a beginner 
Fuckin' with a winner, number one contender top dog 
Head nigga in charge runnin' with a group of hogs 
40 Thevz, MAAD Circle, Cat, and Crowbar 

Best to put your daughter 
Wack ass rappers get tossed up 
Trying to come in here with that garbage 
My crew see the dopest and the hardest 

So clear the path or get your punk ass Bogart-ed

We bust and cuss and kick up dust 
Don't none of y'all niggaz want to fuck with us 
So what's the time? It's time to get real 
Why you bust your rhyme? Cause that's how I bail 

I peep game and get recognized, buyin all the hard liquor 
toothpick and beedy-dyin 
Bitch you got dealt, peeled your cap the other way 
like a reversible Louis-Vitton Gucci belt 

And ain't nothin' crackin' 
For them niggaz steppin' up with the funk I'm packin' Tinactin' 
'Cause I be earnin' stripes in tight bunches 
All the homies carry nines I carry rhymes in sucker punches 

What? Tootsie, my knees don't bend 
Just like that actor Hoffman I be Dustin off men often 
Jaywalkin over your coffin with an eleven shot loss and 
John wrecked that Austin won't soften you're lost and 

see arson, to exterminate the flyest nigga like Orkin 
Stalkin lofts men to New York and in between 
so take caution, leave the flossin for dental hygiene 
Mental plus my gene equals nasty young bastard 

The raps be lung mastered takin' vinyl's virginity 
Coincidentally I run shit like Walter Payton 
Niggaz player hatin' cause I spoke like a Dayton 
I kick the bass like Ron Carter at the Carter when 

C and B came strollin' 
Blowin' niggaz up like when Mookie's stupid ass got caught smokin' 
Figure, your stigma is lack of enigma 
So bitch-ass niggaz better step, like the Delta Sigma Thetas 

We don't give a fuck, fools better duck 
39 deep in the back of Wino's truck 
Like robbin' in the paint, fool think I ain't? 
Your crew is on stank, that's why I'm pullin' rank 

I rev like a motor float ON like a boat to 
kick a style like Tical from here to North Dakota 
The ambassador of funk with amps in the trunk 
And when it's time to rock a mic I won't be no punk 

I bring death to the evil and power to the people 
My name ain't Steve Miller but I Fly Like an Eagle 
Don't play me for a chump, I get around like Gump 
And I, got more con in my verse than Chuck 

And you don't want no motherfuckin' problems here 
'Cause I can round up a posse like Paul Revere 
Your whole crew'll get took out, turned out, shook out 
Burned up like a cookout, so fools better look out 

Fresh out the penalty box 
Sportin' a stockin' cap, cut off dickies, and some high-top striped socks 
The freestyle finatic pyschosomatic back at it causin' static 
With lyrics still as tight as a straight jacket 

The last in line but one of the first to get wit cha 
Bringin' more terror to MC's than a Michigan militia 
Click click boom, nigga fuck your crew 
It's the chanky hip-hopper, takin' over pissin' in your stage monitor 

socket you think that you can fuck with mine in your wildest dreams 
You best to wake up and apologize 
Niggaz penitentiary yearn me 'cause I, burn like Parker 
but anyway, half of y'all couldn't see me with a pair of Blu Blockers 

The lyrical night stalker stalkin' at night in a pair of creased Khakis 
Chuck Taylors, my pistol grip tight 
Dub-see, that nigga from Westside MAAD Circle 
Ay man! Ay ay. 

What's up Wino? 
Uh like loc, it's like late, let's get the fuck up out of here 
Are we out?

Every geto got a different name, but they all the same
So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps
Homies who sell crack
Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks that's a fact
Cause, you from the neighborhood niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, ganstas, and thugs
To unwrap the strap before you know what
The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck
And broke all of the sills where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on account
This time he might get stuck attempted
One eight seven and he's a minor  with pride
So the DA want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke
And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders

Niggas who got warrants out for their arrest
Be your own good ride

Dead cats in the street playing craps
Niggas catchin dice with they feet

The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now
One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch
Liscence and registration
""All I got is a drivers permit""
Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip
Welcome to Southern California
Liquor stores and churches on every other corner
Your little brother plays pop warner
Darks raided the dope spot
Eight year old kid got shot 'cause they mistook his BB gun for a glok
And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano
He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh
I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state
He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8

Hey the homiez kickin' it real
Yeh I hear what he's sayin' loc
Sometimes it's just like that in the hood
Yeh don't nothin' change of the game but the name

To the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up
The house parties that's gonna always get shot up

Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat
Pulling sex in through his back

And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade
They carried their dead homey to his grave
Pour out a little liquor
Homegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting 
thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper
Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped
Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
Big G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks
Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
Young niggas going to school to be a doctor
Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank
Rollin D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
This is just a little something for a nigga
That's still gonna be a nigga if he don't get no bigger
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

Coolio,"Yeah 1996
Coolio with the flow
Rated are superstar
LV that's right

Mossberg Smith & Wesson
Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson
House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know
But I had to go they had a house full of hos

I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head
The hos is looking good so we try to make a friend for night
Let's get it right let's get it straight
But now these punkass niggas in the party want to play a hate

I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that
It's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt
Like American Express here we go again
I never leave home without it so don't even think about it

Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed
But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove
Back up off let's keep it soft
Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name
Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same
All these sucker set-trippin killin for no reason
That's why I never leave the house without my nina

I love my baby carry my baby wherever I go
For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin
Stop wishin you was in my shoes
And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else

It's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet
The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go
Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work 
I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop

Stop hating my life and get your own
Be true to this game or this game will do you cold
Everywhere I go I got my back
I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

No no oooo I can't escape this life
I been trying to live in piece but these fools won't cease
They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip
Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin it's a new thing

One shot from a Jake .38 can make your brain ache
I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin'
But if you run up on me trippin you best believe I'm dumpin'
I got bills to pay and kids to raise

And a whole generation of lost niggas to save
So I ain't got time for that yip yap
If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back
Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true

Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it
Don't start no shit and it won't be none son
But if you do I'm going for my gun
Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary

So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life

That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life

That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life

That they got me trapped inside
This really really really ain't me
But the streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life

Coolio,"Got kinda high and uhh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin beer beer drinkin eight ball

[Chorus: x4]
Got kinda high and uhh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin beer beer drinkin eight ball

I'm sittin' at the bar with a hundred dollar bill
The homies is runnin' late so I got some time to kill
I'm peepin' out this freak in the booth in the corner
I think I seen her rollin a Noble nosin under and moanin

Two hookers walked in and they was lookin' for a vic
But they, kept on passin' me by coz they can recognize a trick
Twenty minutes later and two double shots of yak
I take a look up at the clock, now where the FUCK the homies at

I feel my pagers on my hipbone, who could it be
'Cause I done talked to everybody that I was 'sposed to see
Hahaa! Now I know, the story is told
And I don't even call 'em back cuz they don't know the homie cold

I received a page my niggas from the phone in the back
I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black
Another double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin'
But that's only the beginning, god damn!

[Chorus]

I take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and
see if I see the homies, but they still ain't there
There's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it
I was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it

I opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away
So mister policeman, you can put your chalk away
I mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table
'Cause, niggaz be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal

The homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think
Homegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink
She's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar
Doing tricks with her tounge and a cherry like a porno star

The club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin
Another double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin'
She's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded
It's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it

[Chorus]

Now I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic
The big homey done erected, damn I've been affected
By the funk in the boom and the booty in the room
This ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom

Now I'm mackin' and struttin' and asking baby wassup
My name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump
let's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans
We can do a little drinkin', and do a little smoking

When all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin'
I hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds*
Ahh shit, I got baby on her titties
I guess there go my chances of gettin with her kitty

I turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with
long ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's
Now I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk
'Cause I got too high and uhh, got too drunk

Coolio,"I'm seein' bodiez in the alley and blood in the valley
From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali
I'm callin' rally to the homies in the street light
Take a real close at what it look like
A young nigga in the ghetto raised up on whit
The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit
Playin tag with body bag,
Bullets,
And bloody rag
And did you put the dodge on the toe tag?
Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow
'cause life is full of hardships, pimpslaps, and sorrow
Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do
Make sure what you believe is real and true
Fuck the liez an' alibiez an' come to realize
My vision won't assault of wasted on blind lil' eyes
Like A T an' T ya gotta make a switch
O' get pushed to the side like a lil' ol' bitch....

-Chorus-
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front
With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair

I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah
Lootin' an' shootin'
I'm doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in
Niggaz don't be doin' what they 'posed to do
They betta post on the corna with the busta crew
Playin' games I used to play back in '79
With the same bullshit an' the same ol' lie
If you want some respect ya won't be individual
On the nigga nuts 'cause he rollin' in the Sixty-fo'
Yo favorite line is fuck all a y'all
But one day there's gonna be a final call
That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep
Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep
So pull your money outa your pocket an' put it in the middle
This ain't no roosta ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....

-Chorus-

Way back in the dayz we used to sling 'em in the street
But now when niggaz get beat
They want to go an' get their heat
Everybody know that you know how to kill
But tell me do you how to let a nigga live
I gotta dream that maybe one day
Niggaz can't fight then walk away
I'm talkin' fist to cuff with them pistols up, an'
Shoot 'em from the shoulders
To show them you can hold your
I sing the song of the fight of the black man
In America
In a state of hysteria
No longa will I accept the second rate
I plan to set the record straight be	'fore I disobey
Its the one - two combination punch to the throat
There's a hole in ya boat bitch
That's all she wrote
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....

Rhyme 1:

One night of pleasure nine months of pain
three days later and that's when you came
two arms two legs ten fingers ten toes
brown eyes like mom, with your grandmothers nose
even though you're momma's baby
and daddy's little baby
my love is unconditional to one of us is swayze
day or night, roll the light
no matter what you do,
like the Jackson 5 said I'll be there for you coz
my life is your life and your life is mine
to thinkin'en I'm your friend 'til the end of time
I'll make sure you get your props
you can call me pops
and anything you need I'll pull it out of the stops
even though we're not together like we used to be
D A D D why, you can count on me
coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again

Chorus

Rhyme 2:

Forget about Batman, Superman and the Power Rangers
coz I'ma be your hero if you ever in some danger
this ain't the hustarone and my name ain't Cliff
no matter how old you get you could get that ass whipped
daddy don't take no mess
and I ain't gone settle for nothing less than your very best
when I do what I do coz you did what you did
It's coz I ain't the kind of father that be raising no dumb-ass kids
You gosta be a leader, it's my responsiblity to teach ya
right from wrong, and make decisions of your own
I never said that I was perfect
but I know that you're worth it so
I'ma do my damnest to make sure you get some chances
so just listen to your daddy coz he tryin to tell ya something
and don't let nobody tell ya I don't love ya coz they frontin'

I take a look into your eyes and then smile again

Chorus

Rhyme 3:

Every day is a struggle when life is like a puzzle
that we gotta put together
together so and ever
you need a shoulder to cry on and someone you can rely on
your daddy's home
I'm tryin'a build a foundation on which you could stand
when you's a grown woman and you's a grown man
I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear
when I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spir-it
I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for
the knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids
I know it's hard growing up coz I used to be a youngsta
so we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under
people let me tell ya about my best friends
coz I'm down with the children all the way 'til the end
coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into their eyes and then smile again

At the same old time
With the same state of mind

The walks in the park, escapades in the dark
We knew how it had to be right 
From the very start coz
I got obligations and she's in the situation
That she came to state, so this is our fate
Holding hands, a smile, a glimpse 
A kiss and a dance but we can't take a chance on
Gettin caught 
So we stick to a plan coz 
We both got another and they wouldn't understand it 
Me and Mrs Jones have a thing going on
I wouldn't call it love but it damn sure strong

Or living like a flirt

Saw her from across the room
And instantly we both became consumed by the thought 
Of she and I being together so I
Headed in her direction for some closer inspection
I intentionally brushed her hand her 
Skin had a satin texture
The feeling she gave me was
More than I could measure and 
Right away I 
Knew I had to have her with me
If not with me then maybe just to hit me 
She got pin point skill and percision in the walk
And the way that she talk 
Make my mouth turn to chalk
She give me everything that I don't get at home
And it seems like I'm a man coz her's is always gone, now
Tell me what love got to do with it
No coz we both feel good when we kickin' it
Some might say that I'm wrong and I should leave her alone
But me and Mrs Jones got a thang goin' on

Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones

It's been about a year since we've been seeing eachother
And we're a whole lot more than just part time lovers
Coz when I got a problem she do everything she can to solve 'em
But her life is not revolved around how revolving
I'm the Shaka Zulu and she's my fantasie, but
Deep down inside we know that we can never be
Any more than what we are, a phone call in the car
Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar
When all of a sudden right out of the blue my
Ladie got a clue on
What what we was up to and
Wait a minute, damn 
From what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man
Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
Coz I got a woman and she got a man so
That's how it goes, and that's how it is

And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler

The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there with muted sounds bumpin'

[Chorus]

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryin' stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
you gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Chorus]

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I give love 
But when push come to shove 
I'm 'posed to solo 

Diggin me out the ditch 
(Hey  hey  Cool  give me some chips  fool) Ain't that a bitch 
Ain't no cash just fallin out the sky 
You hell of high 

But why why did she touch the tie? 
But I start on full wit a gangsta limp 
Morris couldn't see this pimp 
I'm backslappin gimps 

True, I'll be in the cut, but you notice me 
Try to throw with me 
Now you want to roll with me, fate 
I'll lead you left instead of right 

Tonight's the night 
So, let's get the situation tight 
I hear 'em tryin to playa hate me on the under 
My momma said, ""Never let a sucker take you asunder"" 

Don't be gettin outta line where it concerns mine 
It might be your time, but it's my rhyme 

[Chorus]
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
And nobody won't care? 
Can I get down one time without 
All the criticism and media in my business? 
Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
And speak my mind? 
Can I get down one time? 
Can I get down one time? 

I take my picture with a smile like Jack 
'Cause I'm back 
You picturin' all them chips in stack 
I got love, though, don't be no stank hoe 

I'm not fallin' for the gank, yo 
God I thank, though 
Enemies it's your decision 
The gift I been givin' 

Got you in the life I'm livin' 
Watch your sane, sane like Marley Mike 
Your game ain't right 
You be slippin every night 

I'm hoverin' up in the nest with the claws out 
'Cause he had his paws out 
When he paused out 
He's out, now it's in with the new 

In with the two 
You know how these thieves do

I can't do what I want, or how I want to 
This shit is drama 
So what is it you want, huh? 
We tryin' to make it to the tizzy 

I'll be a hell of busy bee 
The gizzy 
Through the frizzy, is we 
Tryin to have somethin' 

We goin off frontin' 
'Cause nothin' leaves nothin'
And nothin' means we head bumpin' 
Pumpin', no punk can hit this, my stable 

Twistin' me a fable 
Somethin' sweet like sable 
You shoulda reached out and grabbed it and got his pay nice 
Jealousy got him dropped, with his neck sliced 

Liquor be revelain' 
The homies true feelings 
So, I be willin' 
To turn into a villain 

Then if you're still with me 
You got to chill with me 
Bustin' lyrics with a skill when they deal with me 
Never senseless 

Thank you for your business 
And I got more rhymes 
Than L.A. Times got headlines

I know y'all want to take me down
I know y'all want to see me get clowned
I know y'all want to take my sound
And put a nigga like me in the lost and found
But I refuse to fade
I'll stay this way
Spreadin' venom in the mic till I'm old and gray
And now niggaz want to attack me
Flip-flop and back me
But fool you's a mackey
I'll starch your ass like some khakis
Your shit is tacky and you better play the backwoods
Me and my crew will use your CD for a hackey sack
Imagine that
And it shouldn't be hard
Cause your style ain't large 
And you want to make all the profits with crowbars
Can you Dig It?
When nothin' can save it
Shock your ass like a phaser
Burn and cut like a laser
Amaze you, with this flava
I run with a pack of tennis shoe playa's

Can you dig it? 
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it? 
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?

The first law of age is called survival
That's why I'm deadly on revival
And it's vital
To my basic instinct 
That all whack emcees become extinct
Because we on the brink
Or, should I say the edge
Like a schizophrenic with seventeen personalities walkin' on a ledge
Then you can't see the black cause it's blocked by the blue and the red
U-F-O's
And scandalous ass hoes
Waist deep in the shit, it's still smellin' like a rose
And I suppose
You want me to play superstar
And when I see you on the street act like I don't know who you are
So, you can run back and tell that
But I won't do that
So, fool you can chew that
To all sucka emcees you better beware
I been conjurin' up forces way back in my lair
And my crew don't scare
And we don't care
We act, we wear, I swear

It's the thrilla
Straight outta Compton, not Manilla
Got a choke hold on the mic like I was M.C. Gorilla
Take this to the heart for real a
Don't you ever try to steal a 
Like AIDS this shit came like gin a
Might fuck up your liva
Call me Pharaoh cause I'm floatin' bustas up the river
When I deliver
Make your sister and your grandma shiver
Top feelin' steadily rakin' up the scrilla
Kickin' back in my easy chair sippin' on some Henna
Exol 'cause my whole crew is locin'
And fools always tryin' to fix shit that ain't broken
I'm down with pixies so you don't want to see me
So, grab everyone in your crew and disappear like a genie
Never said I was the best but I ain't the one to be testin'
Cross the line and in pieces you'll be destined
Don't stop, get it, get it
'Cause I blow up the spot every time I grab the mic and hit it, hit it

[Chorus: x3]",Can U Dig It
Coolio,"Verse 1:
If you free your mind your ass has got to 
But you're caught up in that same ol' patent and trap that the homies go through
Searchin' for answers without no questions
You thought it could never happen to you and your crew, but y'all was no exception
It started out as fun and it was all about kicks (Kicks)
But each and every kick turned out to be a trick
Imagine this you got no family, you got no ends
You got no hustle, no muscle, no car, no clothes, you got no friends
You once was the neighborhood boss and hog
And no G livin' legend like walkin' dogs
Niggaz hate to admit it, but they know it's true
Damn near everybody in the hood, includin' the kids, want to be just like you
So, hear I stand as a witness, or, should I say a reclaimed victim
Written off and spit on by this really sick ass system 
You can roll what I roll in the swirl from the smoke
Somebody take a vote, the devil is dope

Chorus:
The devil is dope (Dope)
Out of control
The devil is dope
The devil is dope
Out to get your soul (Yeah-yeah)
The devil is dope

Verse 2:
Things seen only imagined and in dreams
Until, the same nightmares in tv screens your teenage screams (Ahh!)
Cause the dosage wasn't right 
Now his chest is gettin' tight
And everything is goin' black
But it's the middle of the day, figure that
But you still can't see with a thousand watt beam (Blind!)
And you need mo gin to feed your triple beam with schemes (Wake up!)
Cause traffic done slowed up like the one ten at five
So, you dance the street section at around two, to try to stay alive
And now you trapped tryin' to play hockey with some tic tac's (Tic Tac's!)
And niggaz tellin' you to kick back and bend back, but you already did that
And all money ain't good money
But everybody want the cream and honey
Thinkin' that the other side is all green plus it's sunny (Yeah!)
But, money, lust, and jealousy most lead to treachery
From A.C. to O.G. to P.G. to P.C.B. 
As you call for your locs, set adrift in the smoke
It's like murder, heat, smoke, the devil is dope

Chorus

Verse 3: 
Sunshine on your mind but darkness prevails
You move your sales from motel to hotel
Prerequisite for a blast, merchandise, cash, or ass
Bloodshed often is the door where personalaties crash
And it's your task to try to make a meal ticket
So, you can kick it and be swift with your chicken (Bock-bock!)
You's a victim and since you got your own mind
It ain't all your fault, but you gotta do your own time
Choose your weapon cause your first impression
Often dictates the situation that you find yourself caught in
If you still blind and you can't see 
You better obtain yourself some glasses and clear your vision like DMC (Don't run!)
And remember what I told you
Remember who brought a soldier
I want to wake you up like Sega
consume large amounts of dank-a
Man overboard
Beware of the underlords
Stay your ass on the boat, the devil is dope (Ooh-ooh!)

Coolio,"A homeboy is somebody that got your back 
Whether you right or wrong 
Somebody that excepts you for what you are 
Not what you got on  what you can do for them 

If you lucky enough to have some then 
You know what I'm talkin bout 

Friends  how many of us have them 
And not that many 
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny 
But  it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do 

'Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew 
A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click 
And if your firm ain't thick 
Then your squad becomes vixed 

Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna 
'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya 
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts 
And a wolf in sheeps clothing 

'Cause some of y'all ain't knowing 
Me and you go back like roaches in the projects 
And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet 
A good homie is hard to come by 

But most times you get done by the ones you trust most 
So, I gotta raise a toast 
To my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose 
Pour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc 

[Chorus]
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
Uh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah) 
Thick and thin, nigga 
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy) 
If I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga 
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy) 

Now I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime 
That I would of smoked if i would of had a Tek 9 
But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say 
I'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way 

And the homies I grew up with 
Locs I threw up with 
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with 
Why does it seem that the good brothers die 

And the evil brothers live 
And prosper and multiply 
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side 
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired 

I hope you rest in peace 
And, when it's time for my release 
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low 
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow 

My flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0 
This is comin from the one and only 
And like MC Shan said, ""I'll never leave you lonely"" 

[Chorus] 

Me and you is like family 
And everybody know that we go back to back 
And we go toe to toe 
Comin' from the west 

Where the sets run thick 
Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
I never lie 

I run out on mine 
Anywhere or anytime 
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say 
But, if you've lost you'll receive a ass whippin with your instant replay 

Or, deckin like Tekken 
So, show some respect when respect is given to you 
And, watch out for the forty too 
Fake curve 

And fools who got the nerve

A man is heard running and breathing fast
Scared Man: Damn!  Wha...

The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds 
terrified.  The devil's laughing is getting much louder

There is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying 
to hide and everything is in his way

When night falls over the city 
Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
Somebody's comin to get me

Verse 1:
It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area
And every night it's gettin a little bit more scarier
The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick 
People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this
Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?
I been tryin, but it seems that I can't win
I've fallen and I can't get up
And the homies that was my homies went and set me up
Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain
I tried to act a hard male runnin cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin on we supposed to be happy here
God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control

Chorus:
When night falls over the city (When the night falls)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Feels like somebody)
Somebody's comin to get me (When the night falls)

When night falls over the city (When the night falls, Ooh-yeah)
I gotta be ready cause it feels like 
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin to get me)

Verse 2:
I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin on me
And scheamin, I wish I was dreamin
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man
The same old pattern has got me goin crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke 
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?
The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin to feel like I might come up missin
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen

Chorus:
When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin to get me)

When night falls (When the night falls, yeah) over the city
I gotta be ready cause it feels like (I want to be)
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin)

Verse 3:  
I'm feelin oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein stars and hearin whistles
One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
won't stay to state side 
Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your ass on the plate side
There's nothin to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold
Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone
I'm your creation
The product of a twisted nation
Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!)

Somebody's comin to get me

When night falls (When the night falls) over the city 
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me

When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over!)

Verse 1:

Another Saturday night, and I'm feelin kinda slothy
I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry, I need some Kurathers
Peep this, but not up in my stomach
I want to chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Somethings on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, ""Let's go the spot!""
Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty 
Rats run around the room
But, wait, I spoke too soon
Ah, damn, look what done walked in
Pumps and a bump, breath smellin like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe some day me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter

Chorus:  

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)
Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)

Verse 2: 

Damn, I'm feelin frisky
Come and sit down wit me
Conversate about hanky panky
And a little dranky wanky
Tell me bout your innermost thoughts, wants, neeeds and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine
We can spend some quality time
You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen
I want to mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama 
With love for her daddy, anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or, some filet minon and still let me know I'm the man
I'm the doctor, and you can play the nurse
But we got to have patience
Even though we hella anxious
Let's take it slow and proceed with caution
Cause love just don't come round here too often
So take my number, and we'll get together later
And I'll take yours, I'm out like the L.A. Raiders

Chorus

Verse 3:

A few months went by with phone calls and some dinners
Moonlit nights with Marvin Gaye, Dramatics, and The Spinners
Top down on the Vette watching California sunsets
And pretty soon we developed that respect
That we needed so we was here to get the relationship heated
And hot and bothered, no what I'm meanin?
It started slow with some kisses and some touches
A few more weeks went by cause we didn't want to rush it
They say a fast horse don't win no races
And I'm a witness cause real winners always take steady paces
Hand in hand, woman to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me and
We made love for the first time 
In the right way, in the perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot mo than your average bump 'n grind
You better get yours, cause I got mine

You can try to throw salt, but I keep my game face on
And the only thing on your mind is stalkin' more digits than a telephone
Me and thirty-nine thieves jumpin' out of white Hummer
From Compton (Wooh-wooh-wooh), while your crew get dumb and dumber
Grew up straight out of low cash like CB fo'
Now I got dough and you got one night stands like gangsta, yo
See on the low it's all gravy
But the threat of this new world order is about to drive me crazy
And all you want is the Lex and gold Visa
Bomb singles and stackin' your chips like Pringles
While my rhymes jack for platinum plaques
Quicker than one time Jack Black's
I twist sacks and sip yac
Plus, the Invisible Man got my back like a spine

And it don't stop
Till another brother drop
That's why I poured out a little drink for the homie Pac (Rest In Peace)
What's a thin line between love and hate?
A million dollars in the bank and you still can't escape
It's a small world, after all, you're clausterphobic, you can't breathe
So, store your ball like Christopher Reeve
It's the hater in you that makes you criticize me
Cause if you handled your business then yo ass would see
Nineteen-ninety-seven is still crackin' 
I'ma get the ladies out their seat like this was a car jackin'
They say the game is to be sold, not told

I seen a million rappers in the same Versace suit

And your backstage and your ghetto pass got revoked
Scrappin' or rappin' what you want to happen?

We gon work this shit together
We gonna stack enough loochie to get your girls gift from Gucci

Yes we are!
Well, get on down' like your 'posed to
and pass a joint to the loc when he roll through

Verse 3:
If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open
You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

Chorus:
Are you ready to throwndown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and pass the brew to the loc when he roll through
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and give a loc a little dap when he roll through.

Coolio,"I'm gettin' bunions from all the disrespectful sisters in my face 
I give love
But when push come to shove 
I'm 'posed to solo
Diggin' me out the ditch

(Hey, hey, Cool, give me some chips, fool) Ain't that a bitch
Ain't no cash just fallin' out the sky
You hella high
But why why did she touch the tie?
But I start on full wit a gangsta limp
Morris couldn't see this pimp

I'm backslappin' gimps
True, I'll be in the cut, but you notice me
Try to throw with me
Now you want to roll with me, fate
I'll lead you left instead of right
Tonight's the night 

So, let's get the situation tight
I hear 'em tryin' to playa hate me on the under
My momma said, ""Never let a sucker take you asunder""
Don't be gettin' outta line where it concerns mine
It might be your time, but it's my rhyme

[Chorus]
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah
And nobody won't care?
Can I get down one time without 
All the criticism and media in my business?
Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
And speak my mind?
Can I get down one time?
Can I get down one time?

I take my picture with a smile like Jack
Cause I'm back
You picturin all them chips in stack
I got love, though, don't be no stank hoe
I'm not fallin for the gank, yo

God I thank, though
Enemies it's your decision
The gift I been givin
Got you in the life I'm livin

Watch your sane, sane like Marley Mike
Your game ain't right
You be slippin every night
I'm hoverin up in the nest with the claws out

'Cause he had his paws out
When he paused out
He's out, now it's in with the new 
In with the two
You know how these thieves do

[Chorus]

I can't do what I want, or how I want to
This shit is drama 
So what is it you want, huh?
We tryin' to make it to the tizzy

I'll be a hella busy bee
The gizzy
Through the frizzy, is we
Tryin' to have somethin'
 
We goin' off frontin'
Cause nothin' leaves nothin'
And nothin' means we head bumpin'
Pumpin', no punk can hit this, my stable

Twistin' me a fable
Somethin' sweet like sable 

You should a reached out and grabbed it and got his pay nice
Jealousy got him dropped, with his neck sliced
Liquor be revealin' 
The homies true feelings
So, I be willin'

To turn into a villain
Then if you're still with me 
You got to chill with me
Bustin' lyrics with a skill when they deal with me

Never senseless
Thank you for your business
And I got more rhymes
Than L.A. Times got headlines

Coolio,"Uh!  Yeah!  What Up?

I know why y'all want to take me down
I know why y'all want to see me get clowned
I know why y'all want to take my sound
And put a nigga like me in the lost and found

But I refuse to fade
I'll stay this way
Spreadin' venom in the mic till I'm old and gray
And now niggaz want to attack me

Flip-flop and back me
But fool you's a mackey
I'll starch your ass like some khakis
Your shit is tacky and you better play the backwoods

Me and my crew will use your cd for a hackey sack
Imagine that
And it shouldn't be hard
'Cause your style ain't large 

And you want to make all the profits with crowbars
Can you Dig It?
When nothin' can save it
Shock your ass like a phaser

Burn and cut like a laser
Amaze you, with this flava
I run with a pack of tennis shoe playa's

Can you Dig It?  (Can you Dig It?)
Can you Dig It?

Can you Dig It?  (Can you Dig It?)
Can you Dig It?

The first law of age is called survival
That's why I'm deadly on revival
And it's vital
To my basic instinct 

That all wack mc's become extinct
Because we on the brink
Or, should I say the edge
Like a schizsophrenic with seventeen personalities walkin on a ledge

Then you can't see the black cause it's blocked by the blue and the red
U.F.O.'s
And scandalous ass hoes
Waist deep in the shit, it's still smellin' like a rose

And I suppose
You want me to play superstar
And when I see you on the street act like I don't know who you are
So, you can run back and tell that

But I won't do that
So, fool you can chew that
To all sucka mc's you better beware
I been conjurin' up forces way back in my lair

And my crew don't scare
And we don't care
We act, we wear, I swear

[Chorus]

It's the thrilla
Straight outta Compton, not Manilla
Got a chokehold on the mic like I was M.C. Gorilla
Take this to the heart for real a

Don't you ever try to steal a 
Like AIDS this shit came like gin a
Might fuck up your liver
Call me Pharoah cause I'm floatin' bustas up the river

When I deliver
Make your sister and your grandma shiver
Top Feelin' steadily rakin' up the scrilla
Kickin back in my easy chair sippin' on some Henna

[Unknown] 'cause my whole crew is locin'
And fools always tryin to fix shit that ain't broken
I'm down with pixies so you don't want to see me
So, grab everyone in your crew and disapeer like a genie

Never said I was the best but I ain't the one to be testin
Cross the line and in pieces you'll be destined
Don't stop, get it, get it
Cause I blow up the spot everytime I grab the mic and hit it, hit it

Coolio,"A homeboy is somebody that got your back 
Whether you right or wrong
Somebody that excepts you for what you are
Not what you got on, what you can do for them
If you lucky enough to have some then
You know what I'm talkin' bout

Friends, how many of us have them
And not that many
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny
But, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do
'Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew

A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click
And if your firm ain't thick
Then your squad becomes vixed
Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna

'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts
And a wolf in sheeps clothing
'Cause some of why'all ain't knowing

Me and you go back like roaches in the projects
And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet
A good homie is hard to come by
But most times you get done by the ones you trust most

So, I gotta raise a toast 
To my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose
Pour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc

[Chorus:]
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Uh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, n****
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, n****
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)

Now I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime
That I would of smoked if i would of had a Tek 9
But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say
I'm hell of glad that my momma didn't raise me that way

And the homies I grew up with 
Locs I threw up with
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with
Why does it seem that the good brothers die

And the evil brothers live
And prosper and multiply
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired

I hope you rest in peace
And, when it's time for my release
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow 

My flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0
This is comin from the one and only
And like MC Shan said, ""I'll never leave you lonely""

[Chorus]

Me and you is like family
And everybody know that we go back to back
And we go toe to toe
Comin' from the west

Where the sets run thick
Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip
I cross my heart and hope to die
I never lie

I run out on mine
Anywhere or anytime
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say
But, if you've lost you'll receive a a** whippin with your instant replay

Or, deckin like Tekken
So, show some respect when respect is given to you
And, watch out for the forty too
Fake curve

And fools who got the nerve
To pretend that they was down
When last month they wadn't even around 
West coast, East coast, and worldwide

My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died
I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside
And, you can call me homeboy

You can call me homeboy, boy, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

When night falls over the city 
Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
Somebody's comin' to get me

It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area
And every night it's gettin a little bit more scarier
The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick 
People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this

Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?

I been tryin', but it seems that I can't win
I've fallen and I can't get up
And the homies that was my homies went and set me up
Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain

I tried to act a hard male runnin' cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin' on we supposed to be happy here

God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control

[Chorus: x2]

I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin' on me

And scheamin', I wish I was dreamin'
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man

The same old pattern has got me goin' crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke 
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?

The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin' in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin' to feel like I might come up missin'
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooohhhh

I'm feelin' oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein' stars and hearin' whistles

One shot from a little junky a** twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
won't stay to state side 
'Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your a** on the plate side

There's nothin to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold

Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone

I'm your creation
The product of a twisted nation
Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!)

Another Saturday night, and I'm feelin' kinda slothy
I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry, I need some Kurathers
Peep this, but not up in my stomach
I want to chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Somethings on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, ""Let's go the spot!""
Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty 
Rats run around the room
But, wait, I spoke too soon
Ah, damn, look what done walked in
Pumps and a bump, breath smellin' like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe some day me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter

[Chorus:] 

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)
Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)


Damn, I'm feelin' frisky
Come and sit down wit me
Converse about hanky panky
And a little dranky wanky
Tell me bout your innermost thoughts, wants, needs and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine
We can spend some quality time
You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen
I want to mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama 
With love for her daddy, anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or, some filet minon and still let me know I'm the man
I'm the doctor, and you can play the nurse
But we got to have patience
Even though we hella anxious
Let's take it slow and proceed with caution
Cause love just don't come round here too often
So take my number, and we'll get together later
And I'll take yours, I'm out like the L.A. Raiders

[Chorus:]

A few months went by with phone calls and some dinners
Moonlit nights with Marvin Gaye, Dramatics, and The Spinners
Top down on the Vette watching California sunsets
And pretty soon we developed that respect
That we needed so we was here to get the relationship heated
And hot and bothered, no what I'm meanin'
It started slow with some kisses and some touches
A few more weeks went by cause we didn't want to rush it
They say a fast horse don't win no races
And I'm a witness cause real winners always take steady paces
Hand in hand, woman to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me and
We made love for the first time 
In the right way, in the perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot mo than your average bump 'n grind
You better get yours, cause I got mine

You can try to throw salt, but I keep my game face on
And the only thing on your mind is stalkin' more digits than a telephone
Me and thirty-nine thieves jumpin' out of white Hummer
From Compton (Wooh-wooh-wooh), while your crew get dumb and dumber
Grew up straight out of low cash like CB fo'
Now I got dough and you got one night stands like gangsta, yo
See on the low it's all gravy
But the threat of this new world order is about to drive me crazy
And all you want is the Lex and gold Visa
Bomb singles and stackin' your chips like Pringles
While my rhymes jack for platinum plaques
Quicker than one time Jack Black's
I twist sacks and sip yac
Plus, the Invisible Man got my back like a spine
So, why you all up in mine?
Keep the money and the fame cause all I really want to hold
Is my artistic flavor and control of my soul

Ain't no tellin
Most women are still waitin' and sellin'
Most of my homies is ex-felons (Convicts)
In two decades, rap went from Planet Rock
To crack rock  
Now, everybody got a glock
And it don't stop
Till another brother drop
That's why I poured out a little drink for the homie Pac (Rest In Peace)
What's a thin line between love and hate?
A million dollars in the bank and you still can't escape
It's a small world, after all, you're claustrophobic, you can't breathe
So, store your ball like Christopher Reeve
It's the hater in you that makes you criticize me
Cause if you handled your business then yo ass would see
Nineteen-ninety-seven is still crackin' 
I'ma get the ladies out their seat like this was a car jackin'
They say the game is to be sold, not told
You can keep your bankroll, I want control of my soul

When Bruce Lee was scrappin' with Kareem Abdul
You got into triple beams and guns you ain't gon shoot
I seen a million rappers in the same Versace suit
Or, the same pair of locs, that's probably why you're broke
And your backstage and your ghetto pass got revoked
Scrappin' or rappin' what you want to happen?
If I ever come up short you the first one I'm jackin'
It's thieves in the area like aircraft carrier's
We're launchin' F-15's 
And Anti-Wack Maf Machines
Michropone, sittin' on my vocal chord
Sendin' busta's to the crossroads like Thuggish Ruggish Bone

I make it hot and you can pop it like a firecracker
In the bedroom, bathroom, livin room
Outside in the yard, it's a full moon
In the car, in the front seat, back seat
On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good
I'll be the piece and you can be the booty
And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie
You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up
Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up
Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game
You never come the same if we say yo name
Is it real or a dream
You make me scream
When you rub my body with shaving cream
Stick your tongue down my throat and give me a kiss (Mmm-waah!)
'Cause you know it don't get no better than this (That's right!)

And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo

We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime   
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown

If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovic
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open

You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

[Chorus:]",Throwdown 2000 [Version]
Coolio,"Aw here it goes

Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Keenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room

'Cause they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Keenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Keenan

But you gotta watch Keenan 'cause
Keenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top

But they kinda in the middle
'Cause they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Keenan and Kel in your vicinity

Like Siegfried and Roy, Stan and Costella
Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble

Aw here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick",Aw Here It Goes [Theme from Kenan and Kel][#]
Coolio,"Now I've seen places and faces 
And things you ain't never thought about thinking 
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking 
And smokin' 

Pretending not to locin' but you're brokin' 
Let me get you open 
Now little Timmy got his diploma and 
Little Jimmy got life 

And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe 
The other homie shot the other homie and ran away with his money 
And when the other homies heard about it they thought it was funny 
But who's the dummy 

Now you done lost the hustler 
A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster 
And though I got love for ya 
I know I can't trust ya 

'Cause my crew is rollin' home and your crew is rollin' dusta 
And just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more 
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes 
I ain't tryin' preach 

I believe I can reach 
But your mind ain't prepared 
I see you when you get there 

[Chorus] 
I'll see you when you get there 
If you ever get there 
See you when you get there 
I'll see you when you get there 
If you ever get there 
See you when you get there 

More temptation in faith 
I guess we livin' for the day 
I seen a man get swept off his feet 
By a bullet and an AK 

The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted 
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business 
'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention 
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin' 

Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse 
Someone's gotta run a little faster coz we gotta lay the struggle 
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender 
And if everbody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner 

No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers 
And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us 
I'm a scuff and struggle y'all breathless and weak 
I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak 

Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something 
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin' 

[Chorus]

You need to loosen up 
And live a little 
And if you got kids let 'em know how ya feel 
For your own sake give a little 

Oh, you don't want to hear that 
You busy tryina stack 
And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own 
The realist homies got you but you known them longest 

But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone 
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us 
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when 
It's something wrong and we desire 

So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous 
I know time seems dry and problems seem endless 
But in times of despair we gotta put ourselves together 
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it 

'Cause nothing worse than a quitter 
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother 
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition 
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side 

[Chorus] 

As we walk down the road of our destiny 
And the time comes to choose which shall it be 
The wide and crooked, or the strait narrow, 
We got one voice to give and one life to live 

Stand up for somthing or lay down in your game 
Listen to the song that we sang 
It's up to you to make it be 
I guess I'll see you when you see me 

[Chorus]",C U When You Get There
Coolio,"What you gonna play now
Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up.

Every ghetto got a different name, but they all the same
So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps
Homies who sell crack

Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks that's a fact
'Cause, you from the neighborhood niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, gangsters, and thugs
To unwrap the strap before you know what

The loudmouth one locked up in front of the icecream truck
And broke all of the sills where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on account
This time he might get stuck attempted

One eight seven and he's a minor with pride
So the DA want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke

And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders
Be your own good ride

Niggas who got warrants out for their arrest
Be your own good ride

Slap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin'
Dead cats in the street playing craps
Niggas catchin' dice with they feet
Think they got the funk that one fool got stoked out

'Cause he's a mark with a gun
The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now
One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch
License and registration

""All I got is a drivers permit""
Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip
Welcome to Southern California
Liquor stores and churches on every other corner

Your little brother plays pop warner
Darks raided the dope spot
Eight year old kid got shot cos they mistook his BB gun for a glock
And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano

He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh
I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state
He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8

Hey the homies kickin' it real
Yeah I hear what he's sayin' loc
Sometimes it's just like that in the hood
Yeah don't nothin' change of the game but the name
That's right you know that's right

To the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up
The house parties that's gonna always get shot up
Be your own good ride

To the negros real to stop the violence
All the niggas who locked up during the L.A. riots
Be your own good ride

The nigga with all 16 switches sitting ODs
Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat
Pulling sex in through his back
Now his momma ain't all black

And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade
They carried their dead homey to his grave
Pour out a little liquor
Home girl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting

Thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper

Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped

Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
Big G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks
Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex
Be your own good ride

Young niggas going to school to be a doctor
Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters
Be your own good ride

To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank
Rollin D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks

Coolio,"Hey baby how you doin' What's goin' on? 
I'm sittin' in my motherf***in' cell it's the same song 
Tell my kids that I love em but don't tell em that I'm through 
Keep cryin' and tell em I'll be home soon 

Oh baby I'm goin' crazy 
'Cause I keep seein' s*** that amaze me 
Still I had to kill a motherf***er last week 
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep 

I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya 
but I can't, so f*** it 
I'm a behind these bars and it's burnin' like nitro 
I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle 

Aw s***, there the lights go.... 
 
(Hello) 

[Chorus]
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn) 
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know) 
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer 
but I love dat n**** 
Bridge: LeShaun 
Hey ba-by 
What's happenin' honey? 
How you doin'? 
I miss you 
 
The kids keep askin' where's their papa? 
I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers 
It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself 
It's a goddamn struggle when a b**** ain't got no help 

Now everybody tellin' me that you ain't s*** black 
and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the f*** back 
Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot and heavy 
and yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy 

But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus 
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas 
The ends don't justify the means 
and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams 

But you know I got your back to the motherf***in end 
but a b**** can't even trip like she doesn't have a friend 

[Chorus] 
 
(Hello, you have a collect call from...) 
Coolio! 
(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now) 
 
What the f*** you mean you need a friend? 
I can't be havin' no n****s round my kids 
Don't you make me break up outta this motherf***er 
and start killin' motherf***ers, S***! 

I know it's rough, I know it's tough 
but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up 
You better stay away punk a** b****, he ain't s*** 
I don't want to have to kill him 

'Cause think about the times that we used to have 
Don't make me reach out and touch that a** 
You put yourself in danger when you f*** with a buster 
Like shootin' dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers 

You got more class than the average-type hooker b**** 
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich 
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque 
Give a n**** a look and put somethin' on my books 

Peace 

[Chorus]

Ah-yo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas 
now he's wearin' the f***in Lexus like a necklace 
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a b**** to do? 
My n****'s stretched in the pen since '92 

Them visits ain't doin' the trick, drop f***s make me sick 
'Cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip 
And that motherf***er representin' you, I think he resents you 
He got evidence he never presents to 

The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin' 
What's he doin' about gettin' you out to hold the fort? 
I got some ends, I'm a send you a dime and two doves 
Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta

Coolio,"[Chorus 1]
We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday
We blowing up Wednesday and Thursday
She shake it up Friday and Saturday
I beat it up all day on Sunday

[Verse 1]
It was on the very first time that I met her
That leather was fittin that ass and that skin tight sweater
Was curvin around that body and I painted a picture
In my mind I wrote a letter bout us getting together
Green eyes dark hair honey brown complextion 
I was rollin in a bucket she was rollin a lexus
I sweat it now we can do the damn thang if she want to
If she don't I'm just satisfied with bendin some cornas
Drink coronas just as long as she don't leave me alona
I can name fifty niggas now that wanted to bone her 
But they didn't I'm happy bout the place that I'm sittin
Didn't buy shit my name is still on her kitten
Written in platinum she don't just love me for rappin and actin
She love my mind the way I'm dippin in matchin
My blackness, her reactions are like fatal attractions
she jackin and blastin and ridin for the man that she's rackin

[Chorus 2]
We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday
We blowin up Wednesday and Thursday
She shake it up Friday and Saturday
I beat it up all day on Sunday
So shake it up (shake it up)
Do yo thang little mamma shake it up (shake it up)
Bend over touch yo toes and shake it up (shake it up)
I like the way you move now shake it up (shake it up)
Just shake shake shake shake shake (shake)

[Verse 2]
She my main squeeze only thing maintained
Sometime tha that shit I be sayin she the only one that understand
She my boo my freak i know that I'm her main man
So fuck these hos and bullshit niggas with these same games
I let my chain hang and still claim the same thang
And even when she don't love me I'm the same main
Nigga that she call when she need somebody to talk to
Hit her from the back eat and walk wit her
She got a lot to offer look what she brought with her
She got brains and taps that leave niggas that start wit her
She don't care about houses cars sex and bling bling 
Even though nine and half inches is a big thang
She ain't the type that be creepin and sleepin and jumpin in other niggas jeepin
When I'm outta town on business 
When I'm on a mission to put us in a position 
Where we don't have to do nothin but show the love and kick it listen

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]",Shake It Up
Coolio,"[Verse 1]
Imagine looking at life through rose-tinted glasses
And the policy of the people is passive
And all the women got fat asses
And all the homies got dubs and deeds to spend
And when the po-po's pass they wave and say ""hi""
And wear a grin (hey)
And everybody that you meet is a potential friend
And the women in your life love you for yourself and not your ends
And the population's real so there's no reason to pretend
And ignore we are the same, so no one hates you for the colour of your skin
And every waking thought is one of peace and harmony and bliss
That simple satisfaction like a plate of eggs and grits
Senses fully alive like the feeling of a first kiss
And when it's check out time you got a smile on your lips, huh
And the whole world is like your next-door neighbour
Quick to do you a favour even though we come in a million different flavours
And I know there's not enough time to put it all in one rhyme
So I savour the flavour and sweet taste I feel from the rays of the sunshine

[Chorus - Woman singing]
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm sittin in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm walkin in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine

[Verse 2]
If love was a flower I'd spread the petals about the planet
And plant seeds throughout every city and country
Even in those who do not want me
I try to make some sense of the situation that we call life
Some, verbal illustration to help ease this strife
Some, lyrical penetration to try to make things right
In hopes that what I'm saying can saturate your mindframe
And help you with the pain and the strain of the everyday struggle
I don't need it all, I want to see all y'all bubble
And rise to the top then prove to be hard like a rock
'cause you know it don't stop unless we let it all stop
So when you face to face with adversity, just curse him, see
And look him in the eye, and let him know, that he can't hurt a G
And that you willin' ta risk it all
For the things of people that you believe in
So educate yourself in order to assess your achievements
And if I had to explain this realer so you could see it in your mind -
I guess it's kinda like sunshine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Before I continue let me make one thing clear
Took me a while but there's three things I learned to put before my self and career
God, family and my fans
I wish that I could hold your hand
And be like Moses, part the Red Sea and lead you to the promised land
Our demons blazin, and it feels amazin
I can lay here till I'm old and grey and shrivelled like a raisin
Throughout the years 'n months 'n days
When life used to pass by in a daze
And I was posted simply gettin faded, just waitin
Livin life with the eye for nothing but cold steel, fast cash and hot payment
Impatient to be a baller and roll a SS on Daytons
And now I'm here and I promise to get my whole soul, mind, body and spirit
And try to lift every voice and rhyme loud as hell so all y'all can hear it
And still remember the words from that old hip-hop spiritual
I'm livin in a Gangsta Paradise and I hope y'all remember too
And even though it's west coast eastside Compton on mine
It's ok 'cause I don't mind if you share some of my sunshine

[Chorus] x2

I'm diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine
I ain't lyin (sunshine)
I'll be diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine
And I ain't lyin (sunshine)

I fend for my papers my self and my dream
Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or wear my patches
Call the pimp
You can call me the rat
Watch my feet hit the track ain't no lookin' back
I'm on a mission trying to put my fucking click on a mac
But these niggas don't know the half
Runnin' with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass
'Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
I exercise my game until I had my game perfected
I wrote the game on paper then I put the game on record
You better check it nigga don't you every disrespect it

One night stand and once again she's a loner

Keep my dollars in my pockets 'cause I'm hip to ya game

Of cold and bloodless faces in the crowd

Into a cold and crooked wind

Cop Shoot Cop,"Here I am
Putty in your hands
The rain is coming down
And I am coming down
Feel so small
Back against the wall
And I think of her
I feel like furniture
And her echo is slowly fading from my brain
Like a stranger's face seen from a passing train
Out of time
There ain't no perfect crime
And nobody to sing your lullaby
Feel so bad
Worst night I ever had

I walk the bridge of sighs
The tombs avert their eyes
All alone
Sinew on a bone
I watch the cars go by
Sounds like a lullaby
When I nail my broken spirit to the ground
I can see her picture floating upside down
Out of time
There ain't no perfect crime
And nobody to sing your lullaby
I am a liar
I set it all on fire
And nobody will sing my lullaby",Lullaby

Of the boiler room
All night long, playin' its song

Dog, you don't want us running home. 
You don't want it Holmes. If you a 'G'
You as silent as the one in front of Gnome
And you can love me, or you can judge me
But dissin me's like, Beetlejuice in a cape, Super Ugly
Trust me, I'ma shit on my foes
And sit on my throne
So hop off my dick and get on your own

O-H-I-O, no place like home
Everywhere I go, I relocate my throne
Roll it up. Light it up. Fire it up
Bring a bitch to the telly and get high as fuck

Schatz got me upchuckin in a cut buzzin
Might spit about the same shit, but then again
Who the fuck doesn't?!?!
When writers fed, bite his lead, or we can fight instead
And fuck a can, we open whoop ass by the keg
Tell your boys to get your lame crest on
Want to rip together? why'all can share the same headstone
And it's rarely ever that I bury pairs together
But I'm ruthless. 
I did it with ease like Jerry Heller
So if you mention me, 
You fairies better levitate or jump a fence from me
 
Seven eight's a heavyweight, like pregnancy
And you can die in a coupe with dark tint
COPY! Shoot the sky til the moon is dark red
STOP ME! You could try, but I move at mach 10
WATCH ME! Superfly from the booth like Clark Kent
COPY! Doctor Strange when I'm on the ???
The vets I roll with will put your dogs to sleep
Puff five blunts straight to the brain
Jakki's got one five one through a pump straight to the vein
Sights a bit wrecked. 
I ain't even light the spliff yet 
And already my eyes are bloodshot like a crips set

O-H-I-O, no place like home
Everywhere I go, I relocate my throne
Roll it up. Light it up. Fire it up

Y'all cats ain't never gonna advance, I'm big headed
Got an even bigger ego for the one in my pants
Lames hurtin. 
I aim perfect for opponent's heads
Still in charge like a cordless phone is dead
Only writin four bar verses now. REASON??
Can't get past the fifth line without the crowd screamin
Y'all don't rhyme, why'all bitch. Dick in mouth even
Only time why'all spit's when you spittin out semen
Hope you're ready bastards, 
My prose already classic
And like laffy taffy I got a joke on every rapper
You hold your own? NO YOU DON'T
I'll let you shit first, when I start shittin the toilet overflows
And I ain't quittin six four, dyin hittin chicks raw
In the Hyatt on the fifth floor with her hymen splittin
So bet the money you got MY ALBUM'S LIKE HELL!
You don't know when it's comin but you know it's gonna be hot

Copywrite,"Women asked how many times I practiced promiscuity
That depends...before or after I hit puberty? 
I was six watchin hoes slob
The dough mom gave the babysitter also covered the blow job
Older cousin's tongue bathed the balls
I confess, I was molested at seven. No complaints at all
And if I did complain, it's when she'd give me brain
And teeth scrape my dick like a dog playing frisbee games
When I pay for snatch, I'll eat a cat's bleedin 
And keep the reciepts as a write off for tax season
I'll take your slore home, 
Let her pick her favorite thong, 
Play DJ and have her suck me off to her favorite song
Make sure the handycam is on
Fuck a threesome, I'm takin you, your mom, your niece and your granny on
And any other family member with tits and a cunt
Whip my dick out at the reunion like...""Is this what you want?""
Cuz..

If it's a dick you want, I got inches
If it's a chick you want, I got bitches
Whether lesbian, or the best of friends
You can spread your legs open and let me it

What's a nice girl like you doin suckin my cock? 
Or gettin pulled over for speedin and fuckin a cop? 
Whether you loved it or not, you still did it to get out of a ticket
Now suck my dick before I beat the shit outta you with it
Want a milkshake? Suck the shit out and you'll get it

Six four and I'll fuck the shit out of a midget
Lived out most men's dreams when I was seventeen
Been through more shit than most porn stars ever seen

I'm not sure which bitch to bone next
I got AT&T operators callin me for phone sex
I'll make you get wet, cum til you smile and moan
And once I bust a nut all you'll hear is a dial tone
Imagine me givin one shit about a dumb bitch
Coulda wrote a book titled 'One Million and One Clits'
To which of you bitches am I givin it to? 
When they get to know me first I'm diggin you...now
Let me stick my dick in you

If it's a dick you want, I got inches
If it's a chick you want, I got bitches
Whether lesbian, or the best of friends
You can spread your legs open and let me it

If it's a dick you want, I got inches
If it's a chick you want, I got bitches
Whether lesbian, or the best of friends
You can spread your legs open and let me it

In the middle of the night, 
Pillow fight, 
With a widow and a dyke
Dress up as the ex-husband with the widow on the right
To my left is the dyke, 
As I bite on the nipple of her tit, 
Pushed the widow's head to nibble on her clit
Tape it and sell it off the net
For a bitch mad I did it without consent, you're awfully wet
Got hoes suspicious. Even one peg leg bitches
After I came, fucked em with they own leg
They ain't know the difference
Your cunt's wet and your pants are soaked with it
I don't discriminate, even cancer hoes get it
So open up, I'ma cram your throat with it
I want you to suck just like the antedote's in it
All you strong women claimin queen to the universe, 
I'll fill you with Kahlua and cream on your newest skirt

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Cora,"Amberlights in Amsterdam
Slowed me down in no man's land
Chasing dreams and dodging tramps
Playing the cosmopolitan
Driven by your fantasies
Dealing danger and decease
All my love can't set you free 
In Amsterdam

Crossing bridges one by one
And wandering along the waterfront
Felt the heartbeat flooding the streets
Though the surface is calm still the waters run deep
Drowning in your fantasies
Drifting further from my reach
All my love can't set you free 
In Amsterdam

Shine on Amsterdam teardrops in my hand
A rough and uncut diamond the heart of Amsterdam
Shine on citylights springtime's scented nights
Like a lovers kiss the feeling's timeless

With our sweet illusions and passionate plans
Followed the curve to rainbow's end
We were going to fast on a dangerous bend

C’était peut-être un archer avec son arc,
Ou bien un musicien avec sa harpe…

Peut être avec une flèche,

Coral MacFarland Thuet,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

And we're lost out here in the stars

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

And hair like a gentle breeze

You wanted time I gave eternity

Corbin Bleu,"You are individual, never typical
Everything you do, you do your own way
Letting down your hair, made me stop and stare
Very first time I saw your face

The way you smile, you got style
And it shows you've got it goin' on
How you walk, the way you talk
You gotta know you're everything I want

Never met girl like you, so amazing
Every little thing you do gets me every time
Never met a girl like you, you drive me crazy
You're the only one I think about day and night

Never met a girl like you
The way you

Way you like to play, flirt and run away
Everything you do, so unique
Silly way you dance, don't you hold back
Use your attitude, be who you wanna be

You're the girl, flipped my world
You call me up and leave some crazy message
Eight o' clock, heard you knock
Woke me up, made me wear my PJ's to breakfast

Never met girl like you, so amazing
Every little thing you do gets me every time
Never met a girl like you, you drive me crazy
You're the only one I think about

The way you keep it chill with looks that kill
It's a vibe that's all your own
Way you hear your song and sing along
Silly ring tones on your cell phone

How you like to laugh every chance
And the way you say my name
You're unusual, original
In every single way

Never met a girl like you
Never met a girl like you, no
You drive me crazy
How you walk, the way you talk

Roll with you
Yeah, roll with you
Roll with you

It's in your eyes just love the way you walk away, knowing that I'm watching you.
Everything about us I can see, it's just the way I thought that it could be.
When you take my hand it's like I never wanna stop the way I feel right now.
You're getting' to me like a fever I can't shake.
Like I'm dreamin' while I'm wide awake.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Took a little time for me to find a way for me to really be myself.
Always hangin' out and runnin' with the crowd
Then you dropped the bomb, gave me something that nobody ever did before.
Kinda like this groove it just feels right, kinda like the stars light up the night.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Nothin' better baby, but you and me in the glow, you feel the same way, and I like it When you
Let me know let me know.
Special somethin', I don't know what it is, but I count my blessings that you're right here with me.

I wanna roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Just wanna roll with you in the night.
Roll with you.
Music bangin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Corbin Bleu,"She comes inside
Been playing football with the guys
She's all high fives
And dirty footprints on the floor
Next thing I know,
She's hanging out
She's got her dress and high heels on
And we're alone, I couldn't ask for nothing more

And I love
(I love the way)
A simple smiles reveals it all
She calls my name

She could be all I'm ever gonna need
She's like a beauty queen
In just her t-shirt and her jeans
She could be just the one I've waited for
Could be a perfect score and more
She could be, She could be, She could be
Mm hm

It's Friday night
And her friends are home by nine
We hit the show, tip the bouncer, skip the line
Next thing I know, we're out the door
And now she's dancing in the rain, a fragile flame
Under the pale blue colored light

Oh, I love the way
This girl is not afraid to fall
She calls my name
(She's callin' out to me)

She could be all I'm ever gonna need

A secret the world's been keeping
The music that keeps repeating,
Keeps repeating inside your mind
Like an angel on your shoulder
That makes your colors bolder than you dare
And you want to take her everywhere

Yeah yeah

Oh, She could be all I'm ever gonna need

Could be a perfect score and more

Corbin Bleu,"Lately I've been thinking about the things that we've been through
And I don't know if I'd be here if not for you
I had to take a little time to try to work things out
And you should know that I had never meant to let you down

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you
You're always there for me

Sometimes I know I can be so hard to understand, it is okay
Even when I'm lost you show me who I really am
Life with me hasn't always been an easy ride
But because of you I've learned to lose my selfish pride

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you
Oh, you're always there for me

Oh, no, it's love, ooh
It must be love, oh
It's gotta be real love
It's gotta be real love, real love

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall

Corbin Bleu,"Looking back on a photo album of my life
It's the little things that make us smile
That, that, that, that make us smile

Like the very first time that you discovered true love
It's a feeling you can't describe
But it always stays on your mind

Or the first time you hear your song on the radio
That gives you goose bumps all over from head to toe
All the time you stayed up all night on the phone
And you look down and realize she's staring
At the same song as your boo

That's what gets me sentimental
That's what life is all about
That's what gets me all emotional
More than all the things I can do without

'Cause I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter
And I figured out
That these are the moments that mean the most to me

'Cause I know I've got friends, trust, family and love
All around me that should be enough
And I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter to me

The one thing that I try cherish when I'm on the road
Is I know I'm never alone
N-n-never alone

Just look around at sunsets and waterfalls
And you know that God's very close
'Cause the world's full of miracles

It's like that the first time that I learned my history
'Cause my dad looked down into my eyes
And broke it down for me

I still remember my mother asking me how my day went
When I came home from school
And these are some sweet memories

'Cause that's what gets me sentimental
That's what life is all about
That's what gets me all emotional
More than all the things I can do without

'Cause I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter
And I figured out
That these are the moments that mean the most to me

'Cause I know I've got friends, trust, family and love
All around me that should be enough
And I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter

Keep people you love close to you
'Cause when it gets tough they'll help you pull through
No don't let anybody take your moment from you

Cordelia's Dad,"By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,

Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond.

O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.
But me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond.

‘Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen, 
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond. 
Where in deep purple hue, the hieland hills we view, 
And the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.

The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping:
But the broken heart, it kens nae second spring again,
Tho' the waefu' may cease from their greeting.

Cordelia's Dad,"I was out one night
acrawling and acreeping.
I spied a fair maiden
asnoring and asleeping.
Just lay your leg over me, do.
Says I, ""My pretty monarch,
I'll come to bed to you.""
She snored, and replied,
""Just come to bed to me,
and lay your leg over me do.""
""Your drawers are so tight
that I can not undo them.""
She snored, and replied,
""Then take a knife to them.
Just lay your leg over me, do.""
""I haven't owned a knife
since I can remember.""
She snored, and replied,
""There's a knife in the window.
Just lay your leg over me, do.""
The knife was got down
and the drawers was cut under,
and then they went at it
like alightning and athunder
and alay your leg over me, do.
In about nine months,
this maid fell aweeping,
and then she remembered
the snoring and the creeping
and the ""Lay your leg over me, do.""
The babe it was born.
It was an awful wonder
that it wasn't killed
by the lightning and the thunder
and the ""Lay your leg over me, do.""

Telling our jokes and making plans
Knowing it our hearts it was the start of our ever after

Then one day we got the news
Her and her family had to move
There wasn't anything we could do
Then I turned and watched her walk away
All my sunshine turned to rain

Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin
So what cha want nigga, ya punk nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin down your god damn door [and it goes a lil somethin like this]

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on

Verse two, comin with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it
[Assume the position] Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens

Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus

[I got more glocks and techs than you]
I make it hot [Nigga won't even stand next to you]
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit

Corey Clark,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

Say you really love me, darlin';

Oh, I really love you, darlin.

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

I had one time, one

Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Through this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

Corey Hart,"When I was a young boy
I called to my dreams
Prayed to a god that would know
Said I walk a thousand miles
To take one step
When does your vision show?

Then one day I found myself lost in the sand
Staring at the foolish stars
The innocent, so wise, claim that soon
You can draw your water from the moon
You can draw your water from the moon

Now I see the sunlight
And it's shinin' in my eyes
Will I keep the distance from the shore?
Understand the mystery
That I tried to ignore
Now I say, now I say no more

Prophet told the blind man that one's hope
Something you cannot see
Take your right of passage through the dune
Where you can draw your water from the moon
You know you can draw your water from the moon

Now I see the sunlight and it's shinin' in my eyes
Will I keep the distance from the shore?
I understand the mystery that I tried to ignore
Now I say, now I say no more

When I was a young boy I prayed to my dreams
Through melody and rhyming words
Whenever I must face days of gloom
I can draw my water from the moon
You know, I can draw my water from the moon

Tu peut décrocher la lune
Tu peut décrocher la lune

I've drawn my water from the moon
'Cause you can draw your water from the moon

A lucky child of significance

And we're travelin' down the road

I sweat my brow and wipe my hair when I do
I could wear a shirt and tie everyday
The diamond eyes are not the treasure they say
Where's the ""Catcher in the Rye"" anyway
O the tragedy
Young rebels in their glory - misunderstood
Such a calamity
It's obvious the babes do steal the wood
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away
I, I tell you now the summer's high
The forward cast of windswept dreams in the air
I will run close to the edge - every time
Between the wedge there lies a passion that's born
I said a passion that's born - born
O the tragedy
Of unsung heroes searching for their cause
Such a calamity
The unrequited rebel without applause
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away
O the tragedy
Young rebels in their glory - misunderstood

I'm goin' home, I cry
I'm goin' home now, o no

Can you count the days that have left you dry
And can you count the ways you ask yourself why
You carry on, yea, yea, yea
And you can justify all you do
But when you look around and find you're alone
Tell me where can you turn to
I will go to where I feel the light, o yea

I'm goin' home now, yea I said
I'm goin' home, I cried
I'm goin' home now, o no

'Cause you can never forget from where you still belong
For the times I'm lost when I look around
I know I'll always be heading northward bound, yea

But it's only Monday afternoon
Still there's a party goin' on in my livin' room
It's just me and fifth of Beam
Swayin' to the sounds of old George Jones
And it won't be long 'til the whole damn bottle's gone

And I know it might sound sad
But to tell the truth it ain't half bad
I love my misery
Gonna drown my blues in a sea of whiskey

I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin' in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again

I've got no friends to call
They've all straightened up and settled down
And they don't ever wanna hang around
But I guess I understand
This house ain't much for company
Smells like a cesspool here
It's stinkin' nasty

And you might say I'm bad off
But I chose the road I strumbled across
I picked my poison
Give me another shot of bourbon

Cause I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again

Well fortunately for me I find relief
When the world is weighin' down on me
I pop a top, I take a shot, I drop a pill
Turn the radio up, sit back and chill
Pretend my life is a bed of roses
Try not to notice all the ghosts
That are hauntin me and tauntin me
And wantin me to cut my wrists
So they can watch me bleed
And laugh at me, as I scream in agony
I get high for the sake of my family
Cause the alcohol is all that's helpin me
To cope since I went broke and lost my hope
I kicked my girl to the curb of the road
You know I couldn't afford to support us both
Hell I'm not rich, don't have a good job
Do construction work with this dude named Bob
And he's an ass. Yells at me all the time
Pays minimum wage on overtime
Still he's got it made, drives an Escalade
And gets two hundred times what I get paid
But that's okay.
I'll drink to his health and ruin mine
I'll chug liquor and he can sip red wine
And I'll be fine. Trying to find some peace
I'll quit payin' my rent and I'll break my lease
I'll live out on the streets and beg for change
Crawl in a box when it starts to rain
Forget my family and my friends
Forget the world, ya'll, I'm drinkin' again

I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in

They feel my pain and man I'm gonna miss em when I'm gone
But I'm moving on, If I don't I'll be dead by 21
I'd shoot myself in the head before I wind up like my dad
Working a job I hate and taking out my anger on a kid
I can hear my mama crying as I cross that county line

Do you remember the way you looked at me back then

Two hungry eyes wrapped up in a smile so innocent

It all makes one hell of a reminder

Keeps me cryin? Carolina


We had a hotel room with a harbor view and a bottle of Chianti

That spring break in Charleston, it keeps comin? back to haunt me

Took a carriage ride to the battery, toasted shots above the water

Then stumbled ?cross the cobblestone, hands holdin? us together


Do you remember the way we carried on

Blew all our money and we had to starve the whole way home

Corey Smith,"When I was only 17 couldn't wait for twenty one
I'd hang around on Clayton St in the bars there getting drunk
A baseball cap and a fake I'd would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
Well, I'm premed here at UGA
Live on Millage Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead
I drive a BMW
I was breaking hearts
And taking names and numbers just for fun
Stealing kisses wishing I was twenty one

Well Thursdays came
And pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern
We'd pay a nickel for the beer
Shooting pool, smoking cigarettes
With a dizzy head and a grin
4 A.M. on a school night
Still hanging out with my friends
One hour sleep on a dirty coach
No shower off to school
Smelling just like a brewery
With a bad hangover too
The teachers all would hassle me
""Stay awake Pay Attention""
I was catching hell wishing I was twenty one

The youngest one of all my friends
I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecoming parades
Now I look back and have to smile
Cause boy it was fun
Being seventeen wishing I was twenty one

Now I'm only twenty six
Feeling more like forty three
My hair lines disappearing
And I never get IDed
My clothes are out of fashion
No I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o clock each night
And up at half past four
Still I go down
To that college town
When the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can
'Till the whole damn thing is gone
Then I look at all those college girls so innocent and young
I just check them out and say ""Damn
I wish I was twenty one""",Twenty-One

At what point did fate crumble to the ground?
I thought I found something to last forever.

Corinne Bailey Rae,"I awake to the drip drop of icicles
Melting outside my window
Everything was new

I had noticed a bird and seen
Cherry blossom was falling like confetti
What is happening to me these days?

I, I got intuition, oh I, I had my suspicions
I'm in love with you
It feels like springtime

Emeraldine, apple seed, olive green intense
Colors unfurl like petals in a time lapse sequence
Feels like something in embryo

Could I say I'm dreaming?

We feasted on olives from the fridge
We stood alone and we ate
We made love all afternoon
'Til the stars went gloom

You wrote, I laid, we dine, on oysters and champagne
That's what it seemed like
We connect in so many ways
So easy on my sake

Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?

Another rainy day,
We sat inside by the radiator watchin' old black & white films
Where everybody sang
You played in my solitude
You didn't get dressed 'til 2

New rain, says I, I wrote this song on my guitar
But it didn't turn out right
So we just connected in other ways
So easy on my sake

Neighbor's always smiling with the baby on her knee
Mia's sat on the front step getting her hair combed out in weaves
And music, the bass boomin', oh, it's from the car parked in the street
Got that new song on repeat, oh, oh

Used to spend our summer having parties on the drive
Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet

And I'm just sitting, watching, hoping the boys will call for me

Wary of the world 
She got much to learn
Get her fingers burned.

Said that I'd be fine

Give me all your time
And I left your side

And when you would, make sure that you remain the same

Corinne Bailey Rae,"I never knew you were standing on this shore.
It says everything. Explains everything.
And then from then on it couldn't be just like before.
It says everything, changes everything.

So don't just stand there wishing life would fade away.
Don't you go around with anyone that makes you feel ashamed.

Good and bad paradise.
I hope that someday you could try.
Good and bad just some change that you give it all away.
Goodbye, goodbye.

Saw your face in a faded light.
Said everything, explained everything.

In home saw you dazed and it comes to you a lie.
You did everything, blamed anything.

But don't you cut those ribbons to take away the pain.
Don't you go around with that same old crowd
That makes you feel ashamed.

Good and bad paradise.
I hope that someday you could try.
Good and bad just some change that you give it all away.

Corky Hale,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Corky Hale,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Corky Hale,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

That this heart of mine embraces all day through

The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Corm,"It's one of those times that I, 
Can't seem to find the words or thoughts, 
These hazy eyes, the perfect partner to my weary mind, 
And its not been a matter of days 
In fact its felt like an age since I last sat down or, 
Saw a town that wasn't linked by shores. 

And fatigues soon ignored, 
As your feet hit the board, or as the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for, 
The ones who constantly try, to appease our nine to fives 
They are the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake. 

You are not your job, and you are not the clothes you wear, 
You are the words that leave your mouth so speak up, speak up loud, 
For none of us want to sit, 
In evaluations taking notes for hours, 
We're all sick and tired of waiting, lets set sail. 

And fatigues soon ignored, 
As your feet hit the board, or the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for, 
The ones who constantly try, to appease our nine to fives 
They are the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake. 

Why do we look to the tide when, 
We find that our minds are getting stale, 
Why does it bag me this place on the waves, 
And are we looking for meaning, from demeaning, 
The soul destroying task, 
We do all the time on the shore. 

And as I picture you on the television, 
Talking all the seller hook past all the people walking, 
Its about then that I realise that your the same as me, 
So call me Ishmael, we are all striving for, 
The thing that makes this grind worth surviving baby, 
I won't wait long for one little moment, 
Where our dream's to feel alive.

You wake up the next day, and that shit really hits you like
""Damn, I ain't gon' see my nigga no more.""
Shit's fuckin me up times, son
Word, yo, yo, yo

Yo, we bled for hours, now I learned to ?dwell? tomorrow
I had to see my nigga Yammy dead, but he can rest with honor
'cause he was reppin on his quest for dollars
I was the one who took him Uptown, with someone into measure powder
Now I treasure our memories together, it's hard to believe
I'ma never see you again, but I'ma make you breathin through pen
So everyone can see you my friend, in fly sneakers again
Life is sweet and kinda deep when it ends
I still remember you, beefin over bullshit, at basketball games cheatin
Yo, my cipher ain't complete, yo I'm sorry for that argument we had
On 12th Street over a cell, now I'm well into seakin ??? well
What we made up the same night
And through the years remained tight, the same love
The same gold rockin the same nights
Now that you gone, I'm here to reppin your name right

Chorus: (2x)
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
God forgive me for fillin niggas with slugs
And is it a crime when we was dealin these drugs?

And to my cousin Ben
my muthafuckin man, I find it hard to understand
That you gone, you physical form is dormant
I'm lost like the Bulls without Jordan
Tell my man J.B. from ??? I said peace
Son, I live a thug life, I clutch mics
With the same intensity that I used to clutch right
G-Fresh was at your funeral, son I felt it
And if I start cryin when I rhyme I can't help it
Analyse, never think I forgot you, son you my heart
And even death can't keep the two of us apart
From day one, watchin cartoons and shootin playguns
Who ever thought we see this day come
Tell my moms I miss her, give her a kiss and tell her
That her younger child done her proud
I know she heard about me runnin wild
Ya'll gone now, but livin in my memory
You fallen soldiers, sleepin in serenity

Killa Black, whattup my nigga?
I know you chillin with my nigga Ill Will 
inside a ghetto heaven building
With a Mac-11, dealin your jeans, screamin Infamous Queens
Forty-First Side kid, you know me
I know the O-Z's are whiter there, pussy much tighter there
Navigator ?rents been a shine and live brighter yeah?
The same old thing, gun, game and cocaine
Your brother Havoc got a platinum gold chain (shinin, kid)
Son, it's all good in the hood, I'm in a Lex with the wood-grain
??? is never misunderstood, dearly departed
Hear me acknowledge real niggas who passed
Wheather holdin heater, in it for cash
Some of ya'll ???, some are pure like
Columbian raw, knockin on heaven's door

You mighta got killed, it couldn't be real
Then reality struck me, nah, that shit crushed me
Your life ended, you cheated me outta a friendship

Plus we wasn't speakin' as frequent
I was O.T., you was in Queens bridge
Son you know me, it wasn't no secret
I wasn't agreein' with niggas motives, shit is corrosive

Like rust, who can I trust when niggas is cobras
Yo I spoke at ya funeral, your aunt sang beautiful

Sittin' on twenties, sippin' on Remy
If you looked in dudes eyes then you woulda saw envy
And maybe you'd still be alive, you hear me son?

I mean ya daughter was barely one
Too young to understand she'll never see you again
Little Ariel at daddy burial
Unaware of how much daddy cared for you

And I don't gotta talk about the things I'll do

And help me find a judist among me, I know truly you love me
I battled no power but the ruler above me
And prayed for my enemies as well as my friends

Will I ever see you again? Ma, you was so pretty
I'd give anything to have you near me
Life is precious like a diamond necklace
I need you, to point me in the right direction

I'm still learnin' life's lessons, ya my inner essence
I'm your reflection as you seen in my conception
Through-out my adolescence I was missin' you, wishin' you
Would appear in the physical, but you never came

Rappers feel they my equal, but can't measure my pain
That run through me like blood in my veins, my life could be a movie
Who I'm I? A real thug yours truly
Mega, mega, for all my fallen

I'ma pimp, a pen's my hoe
She don't ever move until I say so
Her only purpose in life is get me large
I got my pen workin' 16 bars
When I'm happy she happy, sad she sad
She make sure we both have
She know I got plenty more to replace her
Bitch better have mine
I'm not lettin' no pen get out of line
You did it, I mean, can you dig it
She committed to me, she please niggas for me
My shit's so tight she leave a nigga for me
I met her in a studio, she caught my eye
With her over kickin' whack ass rhymes
I needed a pen, so she let me borrow her
Like my shit ain't ill enough to overpower her
I see he wasn't treatin' her right
So I gave her some paper
And let her do her thing that night
that's right, I took it from that player
He to concerned with his money and his pager
She told me, shit he be kickin' is so weak
I told him, your hoe chose me I'm goldie
Be cool, or we can make the heat come out
Your pen work for me 'till the ink run out (player)

Type shit to have fiends lookin' for more
Your rap is lactose; you cooled off, the glass broke
Customers complainin' never comin' back yo
My rap flow is pure all white, in the hood all night
You made your first sale when I sold out
My shit numbs your whole mouth, yours leaves a foul taste
My rhymes a felony yours never seen a trial date
You need a legal aid, my pen got the DA's paid
My flows sleepin' in a cave
No day's I got the streets in this mad
You need a mask to repair the ? here
You see the glass once I flip this track
You should see my stash, I got rhymes for days
Fuck a right front page, I stay deliverin, ain't no middle men
I never short my man or cross my fans
Or switch my supply when money cross my hand
It's funny, I'm here, I'm like the crew I used to roll wit'
You might as well work for me, I got the clientele
y'all put to much cred in that stuff you tred to sell
that's the reason your empire fell like Goliath
I'm supplyin' the ghetto to satisfy you

Crossed the bridge and came through with platinum shinin'
Bringin' heat to the street like I had the iron

A backseat criminal who pass the heat
To somebody that blast the heat
Man it sound bad on the pad what happened in the street
A villain on the vinyl an analog outlaw
A lot of gats on your DAT taped southpaw
You thuggin when the mics plugged in
Barkin through the speakers like you got no sense
You're wild on the 2 inch
Got your platinum plaques to prove it
Your music's been around the world movin
And it come right back around to the ground on it
Now its time to face your opponent
Infamous cling to this real shit
Stuck where we started at
Fuck that
Not because I have to we want to
I love this shit
The raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Wildin on the dance floor when they song come on
Swinging they fists
Ready for war but its a different type of effect
Its not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranqued by the sound bank
Put under the drum
Numbed off of our shit
Now who you rocking with them or us
Deep love or cheap lust
QB or bust
Infamous til we pass on
You're laughing at the wrong kid I take action
The fam are confidants, nigga
I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of being top dog
As we move through the stage floor I need to bass more
So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL and lose it 
Say no more

Who tale you tellin
Are you frail or felon
Were you makin sounds or watchin niggas sellin
You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid em
You never felt the moisture in the air from coke boiling
You never felt the razor scrapin your plate your hands achin
Yet you keep choppin cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility
Clutchin a gun like fuck it dun
Its him or me
At your best you wasn't hand to hand 
No more than 3 grams
What the fuck you know about a ki man
You never hustle
Lets get it right my nigga wild woulda stuck you
Stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen
What you tryin to do help the guys in blue
Indict duns so that could be another rhyme for you
You a parasite you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
Its clever when you write it
Spoken well for a dude who never been indicted
You know the deal motherfucker
The real make the fake niggas kneel
And lose appetites when you taste nigga's steel
My rhymes are what it take to get a deal
That make it real
I'm like BIG you can't replace the skill
I laced your ill like cocaine in scarface's grill
Your motherfuckin flow is basic kill
I'm Cor Mega raw forever
Y'all niggas know my steez I'm reppin for Queens
Your minor league I'm big time like Mark McGwire's deed
Your whole team is pussy
When I squeeze vaginas bleed
My lyrics they official
I bag up coke on dishes made of crystal
Your niggas they will miss you
My nickel plated pistol got 16 shots
You can take em with you
To the coffin or DAs office
Surgery nurses screamin we lost him
Life suddenly divorced and fuck it it cost him
You want beef say no more
Brace your delf nigga its on 
We spray 4 4 s bitch

Hungry like my ribs are showin', as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut, raw, my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark, I tear you open, cut you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles

When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like medusa stair, I'm so lethal
Obviously, I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace, it's hard to stick me
I'm built for this, in the street, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist 'cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak, I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectance
My essence is gettin' money, my aura like Lexus

On the mic I'm relentlence, pursue the perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw, what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me

I doubt the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper
Son, we nearly extinct
I realized that when buried Spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent

M for the man, E executioner
G get money, A all my niggas movin' up
I'm built for this, for real it's in me
Like RK, I make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer empties semi-auto
I conceal on these streets that to uphold the kiss of death
Tryin' to deal ki's and snort blow, you can't replace me

I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weigh coke on scales that's digitalized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize, the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth
",Built for This
Cormega,"It was 85 Queensbridge was crazy live
Smitty was an icon his son had an MB5
Shan was the man on the rap tip, Marley on the beats
Big Wag on the crack tip, shit was sweet

Trent was a fly nigga, John Boi a live nigga
Treach hung with Ugi, you my heart till I die nigga
Herb was a trouble maker RK a money maker
Can't forget Wee-Wop he was the illest ball player

86 is when The Bridge stuck together
The era of crack vails and dapadamn leathers
Karena was a funny nigga, Fat Boy a hungry nigga
Wells from the 40 busters was a get money nigga

When Tyrone died we cried with Thomas
Smash had the accident that shocked The Projects
Then The Bridge dropped, KRS got on the bandwagon
And did Shan but it was good for hip hop

And 87 hot day mix tapes was bangin'
Anita Baker sang while we were slangin'
Doing our thing hangin' on corners
With Roach that was enormous

Big Butter was rappin', Dime had the tournaments
Rodney was a flashy nigga, Prince Wally had heat
Mark Allen used to physically smash niggas
Can't forget Yammy with the skill and hand speed

That also it the year we first seen Blue Van Deeds
Fun and World was gettin' it big time
And nigga World was the first nigga I seen wit a five
88 was ill, John Hov got killed

In the summer time niggas parked their rides on the hill
Droughs was a fighter, Spunk was a cash getter
Up was mad skinny but not afraid to blast niggas
Don't even ask about a Queensbridge Jam kid

The music was loud and secluded the blastin'
I'm from 40-15 like Horse and Douler
Alley Joe Mar and Troy the future
Jungle to Watson fishin' the Austins

Puertorican one on the fifth floor snortin'
Can't forget cool Chip Hays and Bo Spud
Black Jay, E Flam, Mayo, Wallace Snake
Hi-see Starby, Gram Wiz, Crazy Barry and his brother Robby

A year later we was duckin' from Bobby
On the Ave it was Crazy Smalls Black and Party
Kenyon, Lisa, Inga, Richie, Opps and Howie
Suiter and Bar Kim the Foul One the hand and hand king
",The Legacy
Cormega," 

[Verse One]
Your son's stressin' you out
When he was home, he showed no respect for ya house
Now he locked up, callin' collect and you about
To put a block on your phone, Til he says you're the only one helpin' him out
He said his friends ain't there for him
He wished he'd listened when you said they don't care for him
Every night, before you sleep you say a pray for him
You even blame yourself cause you couldn't pay bail for him
You raised him the best you could
He respect you more now cause you're his best friend in the hood
He said he love you and he sorry for the trouble he cause you
And it isn't because of you he in there
So Live Ya Life...

Chorus: (Singing)
This Life, Oh this life
I promise to keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin'
I'm gonn do it right
So there won't have to be no troubles in my life

[Verse Two]
You single and strugglin', sleepin' with dudes
Get no feelings involved, they trickin' on you
You think you gettin ova, as time flies you gettin olda
You waking up with nobody to hold ya
You're like bad dope, nobody want you
Haunted by your past ghosts, they used to run through
Changin' is your last hope, but do you want to?
Are you still sensual prey when dealers come through?
Is your respect worth losin' for the next man's wealth?
Look in the mirror, stare at yourself
Everything you do in darkness will come to the light
Stop fighting your conscience and Live Ya Life...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You had an addiction
It was so clear
Child welfare came into your home and apprehended your children
Now you faced with a decision
What ya love more : simulation or your children?
The Choice is yours,  In the presence of evil
you started sniffin', Boy you was scared of them needles
Your man died from sharin' with people
You know that dope good if you said ""it's diesel""
Now you staring at your kids room, but it don't seem true
It's sunny outside but it don't seem blue
You got kids who need you
What you gonna do?
The only way you gonna make things right -
Is to get yourself together and Live Ya Life...

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin' [4X]",Live Ya Life
Cormega," 

I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggaz who gossip like bitches
claiming they live but if you pop em they snitching
some wise from the building, the game knowledge of dealers
knowing they lack the heart of those who out on the benches
I was out in the trenches
which enables me to paint such a powerful picture
like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics, every time I sit down
I write, my source of inspiration ain't 3 and a half mics
I must have been an mc in my past life
presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm that nice
people act like, I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot
my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me
luck it was not
for years we ran the projects like a marathon
these catastrophic, my time depth of pride became my own conquest
subsequently some are with me others ain't yet, the gun is within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
some place judgment against me based on nothing but envy
they pray for my downfall like the song by biggie
born in the city which never sleeps till rest in peace
its carved in stone some starved while others bled to eat
rap is my legacy I leave my seed my destiny
except I hope she never see the treachery success will bring
the trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
never sleep, rest assured mega is dope in its pure form
the dealer mc, keeping it real is my protocol
fall back I got you hoping off the style- I was working on it
the beat is lifeless, till I put my verses on it
I reminiscence confinement as I read a kite from
my people with secret inditements
freedom and trying, contemplating putting streets on the tires
dominating this beef with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on the wire
what other lyricist is known for giving people consignment?
I'm eager to find my equal at rhyming
I rock, iceberg jeans with the nikes
an extremist when rhyming deep as poseidon
we lived in violence now I live in a peaceful environment
a secret asylum from the streets where people be wiling
some blind with fury from seeing my shining
like a phoenix arising from the depths showing the reaper defiance",Beautiful Mind

I see the sadness of so many mourned
yet the beauty of so many born
and the only man I trust is god

I'll be a thug for eternity

We real niggas, one in the same
Either deceased, in the streets, or shackled in chains
As war and peace collide in the back of my brain
I'm a decide between felonies (success) or selling kis
Either way, I need the key to longevity

And all my young niggas of dream of living large
For seeing other niggas getting money and cars (Let it Go)
And grimy niggas that be taking what's why'alls (Let it go)
Sky's the limit nigga, reach for the stars

You the type of nigga to talk about how gully you are
Then put on a seat belt, when you hop inside of your car
Welcome to judgment morning
Where the bugs ain't got love for ya
They got slugs for ya

Yo son, these niggas never got consignment
Popped off iron
Wore Fila flip-flops under they cot on the island
Pay they lawyer with street money to eat an indictment
Yet they want the same fucking respect I get
I was supplying during a drought
Fiveteen hundred an ounce, (Hold that)

So bring the madness, and send the baddest
And watch me down grade they status
And turn them all into faggots

It's that shit right here
It's that big boy music!
Yahmean?

Thinkin of a masterplan me and my man
hand to hand on the grind since a half a gram
Understand even then you couldn't pass me hand
was on the land all geared up and Dapper Dan
Around the year of them classic jams
I done seen niggaz get bitch slapped and ran
Word to yam a few got rich and swam
while I was sunk with they G packs trying to pump
It's over, no closure cars gave niggaz exposure
I was carried by Allah on his shoulders
Sober my first AR in the hood
Would of stuck a muhfucker and bring his truck if I could
Understood I was strong headed
But them streets and them guns gave me the wrong fetish
Cool whatever, I'm here we can do whatever
from the cars to clothes to the jewels whatever
Why worry? I'll rest when I'm dead and buried
so for now I'ma dress, get head and be merry

[Hook 2x]
My minds still in the grind you wouldn't understand
It's been a long time since we was going hand to hand
When the block was too hot we had the look out man
Playing the corners to warn us soon as he saw the blue van

[Cormega]
Plans to conquer the street
branded in my head like the mark of the beast
My knowledge so ominous I plot in my sleep
when I eat my niggaz eat
We take the bitter with the sweet
If I die few'll cry, less'll do a bid with me
Once intrigued with money and fast cars
stubbornly I sold crack to my mans moms
Suddenly it troubles me so I asked God
forgiveness for pasts wrongs and future sins
Presently the coop I'm in
View as heavenly as the roof of ?Sens?
Like Vince Carter I'm too intense
for dudes defense to stop me I abuse the rim
Anybody can ball I do it to win
Son it's +Doe or Die+, all that other shit aside
Any sign of betrayal my nine'll improvise
I spit the sickest rhymes
Daydream of getting mines
Fuck scales and just as I ?tri-beamed to digitize?
Pure white perrico I cooked over a greasy stove
From Brooklyn to Queens to O-T
with keys I sold in a V
So cold when I hit the street many people froze
My team deaded the block till it decomposed
And was under our complete control to each his own
I don't sleep on niggaz in the street no mo
Cause when shit hit the fan even Nino told

How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right

And all I remember is me, you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased like I seen approachin D's
I relapsed cause of these words you spoke to me

You said you want to feel me - inside you - conceal me
I belong to you no other woman could steal me

What you give is so real you know I had to give it back

tell my nigga Nut his man Bass is here from Jamaica
I was holding down a fourth and for a other ton
you couldn't touch a jack unless you had gats or box cutters
I seen an ox cutter, so many features
niggaz sneaking up and blowing motherfuckers for their sneakers
I seen this kid cut police up, for real money creeped up
slid the ills out and blew the beast up
yo handcuffs can  make a man tough and suffer
my rhymes keep your mind stimulated like a lye puffer
yo this life is type bugged
I'm surrounded by dope fiends and thugs
but I'm a still maintain my brain frames so...

one thug showing you love for one reason
for all my niggaz that's locked down and bleeding (2x)

Yo the other day I got it on in my dorm
I had Fila slippers on then I transformed
my man dawg from ?Nostra? in the back posting
money started looking when he seen dawg approaching
I said, yo black we could take it to the back
but that's about the time the razorblade made contact
I got relaxed, the fact he collapsed and bitched up
and got ripped up and stitched up for trying to ?get ya'll?
I picked up my ill-son said chill
yo parlay and walked away the kids face build
stashed my ox in case they throw my ass in a box
I could splat the first idi-ot looking for props
the phone time locked, my chrome ox makes domes hot
if I can't live then I'ma blow up your whole spot

when she cried I recognized we symbolized one love..",One Love

You fuckin' with them niggas who bust straight
Menace to society drinkin' juice in the hood, waitin'
Paper made me do it, your body we'll snatch
It's like a London flick against the Japs
Sittin' at the dice table, handlin', man to man
One-on-one, a hundred grand and your son

In life we're faced with obstacles
We want to achieve dreams that might seem impossible
The odds don't lie, look at mine - acknowledge truth
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable
Wise and honorable
The streets raise me to be wise and honorable
Wise and honorable
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable

Beef and money don't mix, invest in peace
I've paid dues in the street, respect is my receipt
Truth will set you free, except with police
Be aware when you sleep or you could rest in peace
I elevate poetically, I'm incredibly deep
Never ball 'til you fall, capisce? Stay on your feet
If you were anxiously waitin' for me and Rae on the beat
Be gracious, understand patience is key
I once needed direction now I'm facin' the East
To give praise like Mohammed
Indeed Allah opened my eyes, I'm watchin' my surroundings
Sharks and piranhas survive in the warmest waters
Mama Sana won't allow me to acknowledge doubters
Couldn't conceive I was built to prosper
The team wearin' diamond jewelry in the projects
If you get knocked, housing's gonna seize your apartment

In life we're faced with obstacles
We want to achieve dreams that might seem impossible
The odds don't lie, look at mine - acknowledge truth
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable
Wise and honorable
The streets raise me to be wise and honorable
Wise and honorable
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable",Honorable

Nous sommes nos propres mères
Si jeunes et si sérieux, mais ça va changer
Ooh
On passe le temps à faire des plans pour le lendemain
Pendant que le beau temps passe et nous laisse vide et incertain
On perd trop de temps à suer et s'écorcher les mains
A quoi ça sert si on n'est pas sûr de voir demain
A rien

Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier (barambambam)
Et vous feriez pareil si seulement vous saviez (barambambam)
Combien de fois la fin du monde nous a frôlés (oh)
Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier
Parce qu'on vient de loin

Quand les temps sont durs
On se dit ""Pire que notre histoire n'existe pas""
Et quand l'hiver perdure
On se dit simplement que la chaleur nous reviendra
Et c'est facile comme ça
Jour après jour
On voit combien tout est éphémère
Alors même en amour
J'aimerai chaque reine comme si c'était la dernière
L'air est trop lourd
Quand on ne vit que sur des prières
Moi je savoure chaque instant
Bien avant que s'éteigne la lumière

Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier (barambambam)
Et vous feriez pareil si seulement vous saviez (barambambam)
Combien de fois la fin du monde nous a frôlés (oh)
Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier
Parce qu'on vient de loin

On voit combien tout est éphémère
Alors vivons pendant qu'on peut encore le faire

De n'avoir la tête qu'à mes poches et pas assez aux autres

Au coeur de mère Afrique, see'est le Rwanda, tu vois
J'ai même pas le choix
On n'a pas de Georges Weya, ni de Kavanagh
Alors je sue beaucoup plus pour porter la torche
Et beaucoup moins pour frimer dans ma prochaine Porsh
Je le dois à tout un peuple de briller fort
Aussi fort que je le peux, ceux qui ""hate"" ont tort
En plus honnêtement je le cache pas
J'aime bien le luxe, 'why a rien de mal à ça

Que je leur tendrai des chèques pour leur payer le loyer

De toi et moi avant la guerre
Nous étions jeunes et sans souci
Et on se prenait pour acquis
A l'époque tu m'intimidais
D'ailleurs je ne t'ai jamais avoué
Ma petite flamme secrète pour toi
Mais j'en fais quoi si tu n'es plus là
Ce qui est difficile avec ce genre de rêves
Qui avant de commencer déjà s'achèvent
C'est la mémoire qui m'empêche de vivre
Dont souvent je me sers afin de survivre
Maintenant que j'y pense
J'aurai dû te dire
Tout ce que j'ai pensé alors que je ne peux qu'écrire
C'est un peu tard, du moins dans cette vie
En attendant la nôtre, je te crie

Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'histoire reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra
Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'amour reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra

Je passe ma vie à te chercher
Je pense souvent t'avoir trouvé
Mais elles ne sont jamais toi
Elles sont tout ce dont je rêve, sauf toi
8 ans après j'ai fini mon deuil
Des fois la nuit je jète un coup d'oeil
Sur ma vie si tu étais resté
Mais pas longtemps, je t'ai assez pleuré
Je sais qu'il faudrait que je te laisse partir
Mais je ne trouve de force que dans ton sourire
Tu vois, c'est la mémoire
Qui m'empêche de vivre
Dont souvent je me sers
Pour afin de survivre
Maintenant que j'y pense j'aurai dû te dire
Tout ce que j'ai pensé alors
Que je ne peux qu'écrire
C'est un peu tard,
Du moins dans cette vie
En attendant la nôtre, je te crie

Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'histoire reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra
Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'amour reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra

Tu étais peut-être celle qui allait faire de moi l'homme que je ne suis pas
Personne ne le saura
Ca fait mal de savoir qu'un jour j'aurai peut-être pu renaître avec toi (me refaire à travers toi)
Ca me tue de vivre dans le passé et le regret, mais je le fais malgré moi, oh !

Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'histoire reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra
Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'amour reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra",Va (On Se Verra)
Corneille,"La terre saigne depuis la nuit des temps 
De grande misère et de guère souvent 
Et pour chaque soldats qui rentre 
Une femmes attendent 
Les hommes les pires et les tous puissants 
Les pires bourreau et même Adolf vivant 
Avait tous au moins une femme qui les aimaient tant 

Et quand c'est pas une sœur, c'est une mère qui est 
Et quand c'est pas la mère, c'est l'épouse qui est 
Et quand c'est pas l'épouse, c'est une autre femme

Alors 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle nous pardonne tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elles nous aiment malgré tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle donne aux hommes le jour 
Moi je dis, que le bon dieu est une femme 

Nos mères paient depuis la nuit des temps 
Depuis l'histoire de la pomme d'Adam 
Elles portent les mots et les torts du monde pour leur vivant 
Le ciel bannis la femme qui hais mon corps 
En infidèle jusqu'à la mort 
Faut être dieu pour être trahi et aimer …plus fort 

Et quand c'est pas une sœur , c'est une mère qui est 
Et quand c'est pas la mère , c'est l'épouse qui est

Si l'or du monde etait dans la main du femme 
On lui ferait la cour pour l'avoir 
Imagine les hommes, si il n'avait qu'a chantait l'amour pour avoir

Corneille,"Reposez en paix
Vos amis du nord m'ont soigné
Tout va bien j'ai manqué de rien
Vraiment je vais bien

Tu peux dormir en paix maman
J'ai trouvé ta belle-fille, maman
Je serai avec elle comme père avec toi, maman
À part ça,
J'ai dîné à l'élysée, maman
J'ai même chanté avec Charles, maman
Et... 
Tout seul les pied sur Terre, Je tiens ça de toi, maman

Père tout comme toi je rêve un peu de trop,
Mais ta femme me réveille dès qu'il faut

Corneille,"Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai le jardin
Où j'ai laissé reposer les corps des miens un beau matin
Je retrouverai aussi ces braves
Qui nous cachaient de la fin
Je leur chanterai qu'on s'en rappelle toujours au nom de tous les miens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai le chemin
Le long couloir du désespoir,
Le grand exode, le long chemin
Et au bout toujours l'animal qui a changé mon destin
Qui, fatigué, m'a dit va, je laisse le plaisir au prochain

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai mon pays
Les mille collines et les vents chauds
Et les rues où j'ai tout appris
Je retrouverai mes vieux amours
Et ma première fois peut-être
Celle que j'aimerai toujours
Mais qui je crois ne doit plus être

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je me reverrai petit homme
Grand de coeur et de courage
Mais tout petit comme tous les hommes
Prendre de l'élan sans recul
Pour se défaire d'un passé trop lours
Sans savoir que l'heure viendra
Où il faudra qu'il y retourne

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Vais-je enfin pleurer de peine
Vais-je en vouloir à la terre
D'avoir laisser vaincre la haine
Vais-je vouloir leur faire la peau
À ces maudits fils de chiennes
Les grands comme les petits bourreaux
Où vais-je rester peace quoi qu'il advienne

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Faudra bien qu'on y retourne un jour

Corneille,"Ca fait trop lontemps qu'on attend
Beaucoup trop lontemps qu'on le sent
Pense même pas me dire qu'il est trop tôt
Ca fait trop lontemps que tu te vantes
Beaucoup trop lontemps qu'on se tente
Viens et montre-moi si on se vaut

J'voudrais pas être indécent mais,
Juste là pour un instant
J'ai osé penser a toi autrement
On peut laisser le temps au temps mais,
Mais si on sait où on mène le vent 
On pourrait le devancer 
On sait ce qui nous attend

[Chorus]
On s'est dit je t'aime 
Et on a fait le tour des mots
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
On s'est dit nos vies
Et avouer bien plus qu'il ne faut 
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu

On s'est dit je t'aime

Maintenant qu'on s'est dit nos amours
Qu'on s'est ouvert chacun à son tour
Viens qu'on répète enfin du corps
Dis-moi tous comme ce que tu préfères
Dis-moi qu'on sache mieux quoi faire
Pour qu'on se désire demain, encore

Je prendrai pas la fuite demain
On s'aimera encore demain
C'est pas mon genr, ne t'inquiète pas et viens
Je serai ton petit matin
Le même pour tous les lendemains 
Et dis-moi que je te rassure et viens

À quoi ça sert d'attendre
Ca fait trop lontemps que tu te vantes
Beaucoup trop lontemps que tu me tentes",Viens
Corneille,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed

Corneille,"You found me such a mess
And still, you took my hand
And held me out of numbness
Became my truest friend

I’d been running looking for a home
But when you saw me out of breath
From running on my own
Is when you kissed me out of death

Now that I’m recovering
I’m so glad for one thing only
I’m so, so glad I let you in
Because

Woman
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful

No one could ever seem to bring me to fall
And God knows they’ve tried
But you could see through my wall
Even when I tried to hide

And I know it hasn’t been easy baby
And I know you hadn’t signed up to save me baby
But here we are now, and better off now, in love

I could tell of your pain too
And I’ll die trying to love it away
But this much I owe you
If I can say

Woman
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful

Maybe, now you can tell me you need me to
Maybe, now I can be all that for you
Maybe, now we can finally say we do
This ain’t no ordinary love
Not when a grown man can say

You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s a miracle

I think I’m gonna have to say it again and again and again
I said

You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful",Back to Life
Corneille,"Just when fate had taken enough from me
That I almost couldn't wait for my turn

Just when secretly
I found little sense in living
And no point at all to the riches I'd earned

Ever so every word that means beautiful
Ever so every word that means wonderful
You came
Now nothing's ever tasted better than life
Nothing's ever tasted better than time

[Chorus]
Heaven, heaven
Can wait
'Cause I got you now
Heaven, heaven
Can wait
'Cause I got you now

I would wear a smile
As make up
Just to get out and face the world

And I have stretched this smile
To make up
For an empty look
Since I wanted to charm the world

Ever so every word that means beautiful
Ever so every word that means wonderful
You came
Now nothing's ever tasted better than life
Nothing's ever tasted better than time

Corneille,"I woke up this morning
To find the world in very bad shape

Freedom and his brother Faith
Had yet again made some more windows
And it was all live to tape

But then I remembered I had you
And I forgot it all as you said ""I love you""
And right then I decided
If a man needs a cause to die for
Then I'll make you mine

Home is by you
Home is by you
Wherever I'll go
You'll stay my truth

Home is by you
Home is by you
Wherever you go
Know that it's true

I wasn't home until I missed you
I've burned your name on my shoulder
And I'll be your soldier always
For home is by you

Your happiness has got to be the prize
If I ever go to war

And I'll need a promise from God
That you'll be here waiting
To look after my scars

I'm so proud to be yours
I'm writing you anthems
And I can't wait to travel the world to chant them

You see, I've just decided
If a man needs a cause to die for
Then I'll make you mine

And I'll be your soldier always
For home is by you

And who knows
Maybe one day we'll have our little army
And we'll raise it to soldier for love
And isn't the only way to change the world really
To leave the next ones with a heritage of love ?

Corneille,"I was so desperate for company
And there you were, faking good friends to me
So I put on my little act for karma

I could have kept fooling the world
But you don't fool karma

That's why I have to say

I never loved you
And I never told you
I guess I should have
But I was too hurt to care
I never loved you
And I never told you
I guess I should have
But I was to hurt to care

I was such a prey for generosity
And there you were posing a family
So I kept on my little act for karma

I could have kept fooling you
But you don't fool karma

That's why I have to say

I never loved you
And I never told you
I guess I should have
But I was too hurt to care
I never loved you

I guess I should have

Now that I've confessed to using you
Just to go through the day

Do you think you have it in you

That you were using me too?

You were filling your rivers up with
Blood of your own

Last time I saw you
You were wearing fire and
Burning our souls to the bone

That's how I remember you
That's how I remember you

So please forgive me
If I never call you home again
Please forgive me
If I never call you home again

Last time I saw you
You looked like apocalypse
Hell and then Genesis combined
Last time I saw you
You were stripping me of anything and anyone that was mine

That's how I remember you
That's how I remember you

So please forgive me if
I never call you home again
Please forgive me
If I never call you home again

And I know, I have told everyone I'd return
To forgive
But that was before delayed anger got to me and burned
All I had left to give of hope
I hope I get to find it again

Next time I see you
If there's a next time
I hope you can take care of your own

Next time I see you
If there's a next time
I really hope you've learned to take care of your own

That's how I wish I remembered you

Corneille,"It's been an hour, maybe ten
Since it's gotten sour
It's been pouring names
Now I'm all drenched up in shame

You're fallen in and out of love
So many times, you're thinking of
Maybe leaving
But that's just straight up insane

I really do believe that our love is stronger than this
Baby please don't get me wrong

Love is good
Love is good
But damn, does it ever hurt
Love is sweet
Yes love is so sweet
But damn, does it ever burn
Does it ever burn

It's been days now since we touched
Feels like a lifetime since we kissed
'Cause you said you can't stand my sight

You're throwing punches
And I'm still standing
But the truth is
We're both struggling
To remember, the better days
The better day

I really do believe that our love is stronger than this
Baby please don't get me wrong

Love is good
Love is good
But damn, does it ever hurt
Love is sweet
Yes love is so sweet
But damn, does it ever burn

You see, the hardest part of all this
Is that love and hate
Are growing into one and the same
But there's a look in you beautiful eyes
That's whispering
Love is winning

Love is good
Love is good
But damn, does it ever hurt

Corneille,"I was born black and free
I was born in the cold
Cold was home to me
Until I was told

I was really from the South
So I traveled closer to the sun

But you see
Flesh burning beat
Got me crossing the sea
Back to the cold again

So here I am
Here I am

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name
But who I am
Is a man of this world

This is my second shot
Winter's smiling at me
I'm taking this shot
To be all I can be

So the next place I stop
Will be the land of the free

A place where a million of colors and dreams dwell
Sounds like a place to me, where someone might understand
Just who I am, who I am

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name
But who I am
Is a man of this world

Now there's this fuss about color
And everybody needs to belong
But take a minute to consider my perspective
You see, black kicked me out once
And white took me in
But white looked at me once
And nearly spat at my skin

I'm so confused, I'm so confused
About who I should hate

I figure I'll just love them all

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name

Corneille,"Oh baby, you see I'm a strong man
And I have seen some dark sides of life in my days baby
But nothing, somehow nothing
Compares to this
No no baby

I ain't never been on my two knees before
And I ain't never been the kind to say please before

I'm out of options baby
And tricks to make you stay

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete
It'll be like
Wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like
Simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

I've said I'm sorry
But I guess that didn't work
So I tried 'I love you'
But I guess that made it worse

Because now you're looking at me
Ever so calmly
And it's that look on your face that frightens me

'Cause that look means you've made up your mind
And that look means my crying is a waste of time

I'm out of options baby
Out of tricks to make you stay

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete
It'll be like
Wasting my parts out in the dark streets

You see, I need you to stay
Out of pity, love or lack of choice
It don't matter today

We can face reality tomorrow
But for now, just for now
Let's just run away

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete
It'll be like
Wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like
Simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder
This will be murder",Murder
Corneille,"I wasn't expecting you
So excuse me if I'm a little unprepared

I wasn't expecting you so soon

You've had your heart broken once
And you've broken a few yourself
That means you know all about these kinds of things

I, on the other hand, am struggling
To make some sense out of these strange feelings

I'm dealing with insecurity, jealousy
And all sorts feelings

I'm playing hard to get
To save what's left of my defense
But you, you see straight through these kinds of things

You are the one
I've got a crazy feeling that
You are the one

You're everything I ever dreamed of
So excuse me if I'm not showing off my mess

It's hard for me to show you my bad card
When you're the one I'm trying hard to impress

Just give me a little time baby
Just give me some time to learn about
All these kinds of things
Have a little patience baby

I don't know how to do this
I've never loved before
I'm struck and truly clueless
But I know this for sure
You see, I am done looking

I only had to care for me

I've had no warning
But let me say

That I will find my way
I always have, I always have

But girl, I have found I'm only myself with you
Now isn't that true freedom?

For there's no freedom alone
Life's been lonely on my own
Solitude is the worst prison I know

Should I assume by your smile
Some reciprocity
So I am not afraid to confess this about me

Il n’en reste que pour quelques heures
Mais qu’à cela ne tienne

On est presque là
Ça fait trop longtemps qu’on attend
Sur les quais y a de la chance

Mais ton courage me sourit
Quelle élégance tu me rappelles

Je sais qu’attendre c’est dur
Surtout, quand on sait que rien dans ce désert nous promet la verdure
Mais je suis de ceux qu’ont la tête dure
Car j’ai appri que la patience est la plus belle des vertus
Aussi la plus belle des tortures
Quand je vois que la chance court vers nous sur le dos d’une tortue
Même si les trèfles à 4 feuilles ont du mal à fleurir
Moi j’ai ballonné mes larmes avec mon plus beau sourire
Car j’y crois moi
A ces menottes qu’on dessert
A ce beau soleil en plein hiver
A ces rêves qu’ont le coeur qui bat
A ce gang victorieux après ce non combat
Non ne me lâche pas la main car j’ai besoin de ça
Besoins de croire même une seule seconde que mon tour viendra
Ta présence et tes mots me servent d’oxygène

Corneille,"Eh, mon paradis

Et si le bout de mes rêves, mes rêves
N'était qu'un bout de toi
Et si au bout des tes lèvres, tes lèvres
Renaissait un autre moi
Et si le bonheur qui me fait perdre haleine
N'était pas plus que ça
Et si l'amour avec toi, avec toi c'était ça
Le coup d’œil à l'au delà

Et si on n'a que la vie
Qu'est ce qu'on attend allumons le feu
Et si on n'est que la nuit
Je fais de nous mon dernier vœu
Tu n'as qu'à dire un mot
Prends le temps qu'il faut

Et si c'était toi, mon paradis
Et si c'était moi, ton paradis
Quand on fait ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes indéfinis
Je sais qu'ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes notre infini
Et si c'était ça, le paradis

Et si dans le fond de tes yeux se révélait un fond de moi
Et si dans le chaud de ton corps je retrouvais enfin la foi
Et si le malheur lui seul dit que tu ne me remarques pas
De quoi aurais-je peur maintenant, maintenant
Je le sais, je le sais que tu ne vois que moi

Tu n'as qu'à dire un mot
Prends le temps qu'il faut

Et si c'était toi, mon paradis
Et si c'était moi, ton paradis
Quand on fait ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes indéfinis
Je sais qu'ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes notre infini
Et si c'était ça, le paradis",Le  Paradis [Robin Notte Acoustic Remix]

T’es où dans les charts?
Es-tu disque d’or?
T’as combien de friends et de followers?
Est-ce que tu chantes encore?

Tant qu’il est chaud je bats le fer

Plus la chute est inévitable
Plus le chemin est long
Plus le succès est durable
Les étoiles sont filantes
S'envolent vers l'oubli
Se pressent vers une mort lente
À force de raccourcis
À force de stratagème
À force de tricherie
Viennent les trancher à eux-mêmes
Là j'sais encore qui j'suis
Fidèle à mes idées
Comme Corneille persuadé qu'on récolte l'amour en semant de la sincérité
Ne rêve pas ta vie, mais vis tes rêves
Méfie toi des raccourcis, la victoire y est brève
On a tellement attendu, on est plus pressé
Vu qu'on ne s'est pas perdu on finira par trouver

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Living in your pockets and talking through your hat
But it won't take long
To turn your head around

Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow

Won't you make a showing everybody knows what to do
Take a dive from your ivory tower
And fall on everyone will catch you, everyone

To hear a little talk about what's been on your mind

A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more

But there is no easy way around it

Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try

Are we alive
Or just a dying planet
What are the chances
Ask the man in your heart for the answers
And when you feel afraid

Love one another
When you've lost your way
Love one another
And when you're all alone
Love one another
And when you're far from home
Love one another
And when you're down and out
Love one another
And when your hopes run out
Love one another
And when you need a friend

We got to love one another",Natty Dread

När blod och tarmar flyter och om era pojkars mod
Min tapperhet är slut, jag tänker desertera,
Och göra det som flera än jag funderat ut

Snart är det inspektion, här är för hett i solen
Nu kastar jag pistolen och gör revolution
Så nästet över ån, det får ni själv förgöra

Att det finns bättre fält, än slagfält där det mördas
Och bara döden skördas och bryter era tält

Och börjar slåss mot döden och sjukdomar och svält

Cornelius,"On that cold winter day At that club
You and I met It had been a long time
Playing on that stage That skinny guy
Hitting his drum Banging his cymbal

Crash!

A row of glasses Sitting on the table
I choose one I pick it up
As I lift it to my lips I saw you
You looked into my eyes I felt it slip away

Crash!

Now it's broken My glass is in pieces
Gather them together Melt them down with fire
Now I can make A glass figure
It looked like somebody Maybe Mick Jones?

Exposure inside the head
Ties in the image

Sympathized sound
Elastic
Deep inside the ear
Resonance inside the heart

Absorbs inside the heart

We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured someday soon
(Someday) We kissed

Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say

Now when twilight dims the sky above

There's one thing that I'm certain of
Return I will to old Brazil
