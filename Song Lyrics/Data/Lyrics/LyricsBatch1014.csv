Matthew Broderick,"And I just want to wish everybody, good luck
Mr. Bloom, hasn't anyone ever told you
It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night

If you do, I tell you
It is certain by the curtain
You are through

Good luck

It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night
Once it's said, you are dead
You will get the worst reviews
You've ever read

Good luck

Even at the Comedie-Francaise
On the opening night they are scared
""Bon chance, mes amis,"" no one says
The only word you ever hear is
Merde

Good luck, good luck, good luck

It's verboten, wishing luck on opening night
Take advice, don't think twice
Or your show will surely end
Up in the Scheiss

Guten lucken

At the famous La Scala in Milan
On opening night it's a rule
In Boccu Lupa they say with Elan
And just for luck they all shout
""Bah fongool""

I got it, now I'll never say
""Good luck"" on opening night
That's the rule, I'm no fool
What do I say, I beg?

What you say is,
""Break a leg""
Break a leg?
Yes, break a leg

If you're clever
Good luck
You'll endeavor
To never, never, never, never
Ever, ever, ever say
On opening night

",You Never Say Good Luck on Opening Night
Matthew Brubeck,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Matthew Cook,"Storm warning,
Feels like a heavy rain.
Winds on the coast tonight.
We may get tossed tonight. 

Storm warning,
He's made it pretty plain
He's fallin' for another,
Found a new lover, and he won't be back again.

Can't stop a river, 
When it's burst it's banks.
I've seen the look in his eyes
He's in love and hypnotized.

Time of mourning.
There's already been a flood of my tears.
Such a sense of loss tonight,
Nought to do but ride it out.

Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks.
I wonder how long it's gonna take
To get over this heartbreak.

Storm warning,
Feels like a heavy rain.
Winds on the coast tonight.
We may get tossed tonight.

Matthew Cook,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight
Matthew Cook,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns
Matthew Cook,"Fort Worth neon shinin' bright 
Pretty lights red and blue 
They shut down all the honky tonks tonight 
Say a prayer or two, if they only knew 

You used to say the highway was your home 
But we both know that ain't true 
It's just the only place a man can go 
When he don't know where he's travelin' to 

Colorado's always clean and healin' 
Tennessee the spring is green and cool 
But it never really was your kind of town 
So you went around with the Fort Worth blues 

Somewhere out across the Great Divide 
Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few 
A man can see his way clear to the light 
Just hold on tight, that's all you got to do 

They say in Texas the weather's always changin' 
One thing change will bring is something new 
Houston really ain't too bad a town 
So you hung around with the Fort Worth Blues 

There's a full moon over Galway Bay tonight 
Silver light on green and blue 
Every place I travel to find 
Some kind of sign that you've been through 

Amsterdam us always good for grievin' 
London never fails to leave me blue 
Paris really ain't my kind of town 
So I walked around with the Fort Worth blues",Fort Worth Blues
Matthew Cook,"Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town.

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon.

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day 
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon",Levon
Matthew Cook,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are fallin'
To the sound of the breezes that blow
An' I'm trying to please to the callin'
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

One more moon dance with you
In the moon light, on a magic night
All the moon light, on a magic night
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?",Moondance

Matthew Cook,"Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh
With things, things for you and for me

Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas, may your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

Matthew Cook,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Matthew Cook,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met

Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Matthew Davidson,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true,

My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,

Can I take you for a walk, young girl

Between my mind and evening
Don't give up on my bad luck
It's all I got with me

I can see the future shine
This is the beginning of time
We can make a mountain collapse to the sea
I am the beginning of me

If temptation runs you down
And my lust is conservation
Lie chains around my throat
Let them rust for my salvation

Whisper in my ears
Share with me your wisdom
I won't tell about your smell
We can join in with them

Matthew Dear,"It's alright to be someone else sometimes
Actions to feed on the right
Circle and wounded love in your life
Sustain her fears deep inside

Babe, hey babe, jar of hearts
Defeating the purpose and hangin' on the wall
Love is the moon in the sky with a string hangin' down
To the ground I can't touch it

Always the silent one
Who sneaks up from behind
Closer to the end

I'm right in front of you now
I try to be such a stank
All that I'll know tomorrow
Is what I've learned today

I'm right in front of you now

Matthew Dear,"Take a trip on something else 
I feel exodus, when I feel golden 
There's something deep inside her, when she has spoken 
We have to concentrate to get the feeling right 
If all I had was this, I'd feel so satisfied 
Take a trip on something else 
And it's like everyone finds a home in the afterlife 
I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore 
Is it me?
Or is it you?
Is it time for something new?
It's not bad anymore
It's not bad anymore
I don't think about anything but you 
When you go away I can't be myself because I'm stuck on you 
Try to oppress this dreaming of you 
What's it gonna take to get on board a basis with you?
Take a trip on something else",Fighting is Futile
Matthew Dear,"It’s just one in a million hearts that feel the way, the way I do x2
Am I the chrome man, am I not of great design?
Do I feel love like all of the others or this feeling only mine?
Are you my delicious game? Is it an obvious play?
I’ll eat like a lion and pretend I’m trying but we know it’s one in the same.

Am I one heartbeat away from receiving a damaging shock to my life and believing that love was a cost worth a witness and seeing a larger machine?
Fighting is futile but I can’t concede to interior beliefs that control and deplete you dismounting a love which has grown from beneath you an ancient machine.

We’re on the ground, we can’t go far,
God’s in the hands, as in their hearts,
A poison brain, pass through the day,
Point at the frame, around the flame,
Trust is a form, and as a breed,
I will protect, you from my needs,
We can go far, sit where you stand,
And on your heart, and on your man

It’s just one, in a million hearts, that feels the way, the way I do x2",Her Fantasy

To receive us when changes fail

While the moss shall ease your head

As the dirt shall be your bed

And I want to tell you you're the sweetest thing that the Lord has ever made
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days

They say youth is a vision that we can't see till we're old
But you're the sweetest revelation that these weary eyes will ever hold

And I want to lay next to you when our glory fades
And I want to lay next to you, I'll never turn away
And I want to tell you you're the sweetest thing that the Lord has ever made

Why aren't you still standing on the sidewalk by my stairs?
Seems like everyone's movin' away
Oh child, seems like everyone's movin' away

There's so much beauty and it fades so soon
There's so much beauty and it fades so soon

Matthew F. Morris,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

And silent stars watch as we sleep

Here beside me all the while
She'll just dream away
Until the break of day
And gently wake me with a smile

She makes me laugh
She makes me cry
She brings down
And takes me high
She fills my life
And makes it real
No matter what she does
She makes me feel

Her nightime dreams they slip away
She's there beside me still
The way she always will

The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you

But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece

I buy a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece

Where we can really find release
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece
Hey baby come and go

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

If you'd surrender
Just for a tender

Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you

And I'd be true

That I'd be playing solitaire

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

Matthew Gee,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

I fall asleep convinced that I ain't breathing

You know it's true
There's nothing I can do
Pick a fight, it's just you being right
Walk away, there's nothing I can say
You know it's true
There's nothing I can do about you

So don't you mind the gap when you leave
There'll be time enough to turn tail tomorrow",Metal Airplanes
Matthew Good,"The crowded future stings my eyes
I still find time to exercise
In uniform with two white stripes 

Unlock my section of the sand
It's fenced off to the water's edge
I clamp a gasmask on my head 

[Chorus]
On my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight 

Another tanker's hit the rocks
Abandoned to spill out its guts
The sand is laced with sticky glops 

O' Shimmering moonlight sheen upon
The waves and water clogged with oil
White gases steam up from the soil 

[Chorus]

I squish dead fish between my toes
Try not to step on any bones
I turn around and I go home 

I slip back through my basement door
Switch off all that I own below
Dive in my scalding wooden tub 

My own beach at night
Electric Moonlight 

There will always be a moon

Now I can get rid of myself
If all of this kills

And it don't mean a thing
Ain't it terrible to think?

By flashlight I had found you
You just held my hand
By the bright lights in some ICU
Even the planless have a plan
I can't write love songs when I'm on these things
I'm affable, responsible
But hard to be around
It's correctable and they're right you know
It's as easy as it sounds
It's as easy as it sounds
It's all as easy as it sounds

Just black out, wake up foreign, wander home

Take me out, lay me down

They're burning futures in the mountains [??]

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

It’s so material, criminal, what we put up on a pedestal
Need a spark to start a fire
Don’t be afraid of a chance for a miracle
Scare it away being cynical
Step into open skies, close your eyes
Jump into something you don’t recognize
Just reach your arms out wide

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by
But we’ll survive 'cause we got love
Think of what we had, we got love
And it’s all we had, we got love
Think of what we had, we got love

I’ll be the voice when the whispers get too loud
Your home base and the king that keeps you crowned
Your breath when you’re choking on your words
Your sex your right turn
When you’re ready to start, lean on my heart baby
Close your eyes just reach your arms out wide

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by
But we’ll survive 'cause we got love
Think of what we had, we got love
And it’s all we had, we got love
Think of what we had, we got love

Don ‘t need a tune with a view on the Westside
Just wanna wake up at your side
'cause when you know it, you know it
In the blink of a moment
It’s like I‘m, like I‘m, like I’m falling for the first time

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by
But we’ll survive 'cause we got love
Think of what we had, we got love
And it’s all we had, we got love
Think of what we had, we got love",Parachute

Come 9 AM
I pack another suitcase
Leave you in your bed so warm
I'll do my best not to wake you, but it's useless
Can't tiptoe 'round this no more, oh

It's gonna get much harder
Before it gets better baby and that's for sure, mm
Just say you'll wait for my footsteps on the staircase

With skin dark by the sun
Eyes so wide and deep with reckless dreams

You were always talking 'bout the sea

You never seemed to shrink from mystery
That was life to you

And you would find a resting place
Where stars would light the room
And trees would bend with sacred grace
Beneath the silver moon

It's like a treasure map
To all I've had
I found you along the way
I remember how you'd look at me
Skies are never grey in the past

Remember when falling stars were meant for you?
We'd always find the love to fall into
Everything felt like April, May and June
We got so far without a clue

Each day's a second chance
To make up for what I missed before
I come with empty hands
And a prayer
I'd forgotten who I was
'Till I stumbled through my history
I came to life because you were there

Remember when falling stars were meant for you?
We'd always find the love to fall into

Matthew Ross,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Matthew Ryan,"I wandered up to what I thought was your door
I'd only been there a hundred times before
I gave it my most polite rap and wish
I held my heart loosely in my other fist

The dead of winter in North Hollywood
The struggling actress and her flash flood
Smell of perfume cash and love
The sucker punch with a horseshoe in the glove

Sayin' if I held you up, would that be enough?
I gave you all that I was capable of
Would that be enough?
Would that be enough?

A trailer park tycoon last June
A telegraph a flash and a boom
An autumn like there never was
A why and because

Hopin' if I held you up would that be enough?
If I gave you all that I was capable of
Would that be enough?
Would that be enough?

The long road
A train whistle
There she goes
",Certainly Never
Matthew Ryan,"It's not the things that
I can't change that bother me
And it's not the things that
I don't know that undermine me

It's not the thing that
I can't hold or the balancing wire
That broke, that throws me

It's not the fact that
You walked out that bewilders me
It's not the sleep that
I can't steal that wires me

It's not the coffee or the pills
It's not this space that
I can't fill that kills me

Well, in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been bent 'til it was twisted

And in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been burned
But it's still willing to try and shine

It's not the drunks and their devices
That provoke me
And it's not the politics of love and distance
And all that that shit evokes in me+

It's not the Sunday morning fights
Or this soul on ice that numbs me
And it's not the passing of another Indian
Summer that saddens me

It's no the shutter in the undertow
That bears down on me
It's not everything ending as it begins
Or the loneliness that grins that destroys me

Well, in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been bent 'til it was twisted

And in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been burned
But it's still willing to try and shine, yeah shine

Matthew Ryan,"I was sitting in hell's kitchen
Contemplating murder
Contemplating murder
Contemplating the great escape

When you walked in
Looking like crap but satisfied
I swear that you looked satisfied
And I hated you for that

Well, someone once said
If you never look back
Then you'll never regret, nothing
Oh, but nothing
Has got a way of sneakin' up

Well, I know you did not ask
But I've got some comfort to offer
Nothing very good or bad ever lasts

Well, the bum that slipped underneath the fridge
Like a phantom card, we call him happiness
And all that happiness is a miserable son of a bitch

Now the kitchen's getting crowded
And the band is really loud
And there's a fat man saying he's my friend
Well, hey, man, if you're my friend
Will you spot me a drink?

And the couple in the corner
They're the reason why I hate rock and roll
'Cause rock and roll is dead, is dead, is dead

Well, I know you did not ask
But I've got some comfort to offer
Nothing very good or bad ever lasts

Yeah, on day soon that dam is gonna break

Matthew Ryan,"The dead girl mopes through a dead scene
With a cross-stitched lip she's picking at the seams
She's got bravado she says she's been
Featured in a few magazines

Outside the bar Hank is straddling a police car
His fingers are purple and numb from circling crow bar
Well, twenty-four years have made it clear
That things ain't ever what they appear

Now, now, he says, ""I won't be going easily
No, I won't be going lightly
And I won't be going peacefully
No, I won't be going innocently""

A sweet drink spiked with a speed ball
A twenty foot ladder and a ninety foot wall
Dark shadows are gathering
And swaggering down the hall

And I know, I won't be going easily
No, I won't be going lightly
And I won't be going peacefully
No, I won't be going cleanly

Never more
Got so low they had to use
The jaws of life
To yank me up from under the floor
Thrilled to be here

It's strange when nothing gets to taste so satisfying
That you don't mind the rot gut
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From Bostone to Philly and I don't know maybe St. Louis
Got a patch
From my therapist
Sha's got a heart like a yacht
But she's all screwed up, she's a pugilist

But if I could choose I'd ask to have
Dr. Martin Luther King back
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From D.C. to Dallas and I don't know maybe Memphis
So when this ship eventually sinks
That'll be alright
Got a friend
In a cracked house
That sits around all day wonderin' who and when
Shot the lights out
But some things won't be explained
Like the cabby that fell asleep in Hoboken
And woke up Shirley MacLaine
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From Hollywood to the East village and I don't know maybe midland Texas
So when this ship eventually sinks
When this ship finally sinks
When all this shit don't mean a thing

In some kind of purgatory dodging the CIA
With a head full of soot, waving black flags
Throwing off the bodies just to cut down on the drag

Matthew Ryan,"There's only one light on in the house
And that's the light up in the hall
And it's shining on the back of my head

And I'm concentrating hard
On the cigarette, to the ashtray
From the ashtray back to my lips

So I lean up from my easy chair
I rub my three day beard
And give that thousand yard stare
As I recall all the time and the money we spent
Before I became irrelevant

So the straw dog threw rock salt
And the precious girl took a bow and walked
As I ran my finger over the screen door

Yeah, every kiss has reeked of betrayal
Since my heroine jumped the guardrail
And decided who she wanted to be once more

Now, every night I'm paralyzed
By the fear of rope burns and morning light
And the smell of wet cement
Since I became irrelevant

Now, memory's just a flash flood
A thick and black sticky mud
And heartache it's like a breaking bone

It was always twelve hours on a missionary line
You think I would've spared some time
But I didn't, I never went home

Now, it occurs to me like blinds undrawn
Or a bullet from a shotgun
That she knew long ago, oh, what it meant
To feel irrelevant

Now, I'm always smilin', cryin'
And hidin' my intent
Since I became irrelevant
",Irrelevant
Matthew Ryan,"I saw the lights of the Commodore Barry
From the deck of the ghost of the flower street ferry
And I felt the shock of an atom bomb
When the tired old city of Chester
Was draped and dying in my arms
For a while I was lost under the weight of remembering
Of how the sun would warmthe projects some mornings
When the birds were falling like winter's frozen rain
And I was all fingers numb holding a brown paper lunch
Twelve years old and already ashamed
Now soon I was floating over Highland Avenue
By my side was the Red Cross, the Pope and the President too
Yeah I had returned like I swore I would
To right some wrongs and sing my song
And share the luck that every man should
But when the fever broke and I awoke from the dream
I was passed out beside a jukebox siphoning gasoline
When my brother yanked me hard from the corner bar
And carried my drunk bones all the way home
Draped and heavy in his arms
",Lights of the Commodore Barry
Matthew Ryan,"Well, I smoked my
Throat out last night
Hoping you'd call
Or just stop by

Now, I'm wheezing
Like the Oakland sky
Feeling like
The rusted tracks
And forgotten dream
Of the old train lines

It's a perpetual stone
In my shoe
One that I'll always
Be trying to shake loose
An ache in my chest
And a thorn in my side

More than a scratch
Beneath this skin
Somewhere between
The beginning and the end

I don't feel a lot lately
I don't feel whole lately
I don't feel much lately
That's how I hide
That's how I hide

You wrote it down not to
Draw attention to yourself
You let the pilot just
To blow it out

Here the conversation's
Always too loud
And we're as pathetic as the jumper
That listens to the crowd

To say I miss you
Wouldn't be enough
I feel like Tom Waits
Singing, 'Diamonds and rust'
And I'm as pathetic as a junkie
Who knows what he does

It's a perpetual stone
In my shoe
One that I'll always
Be trying to shake loose

For cover, deep in those dark and lonely hallways of my heart
And there were problems
You said there was something wrong with me
And they were deep-seated they were deep-rooted
I must've pushed 'em away I pushed 'em away
So you left with the impression that if I could just clear my head
You'd be back with me on day
But now you walk the roads with a rose in your teeth

I hear a symphony
Every time you cough up a noose

Late at night when the shots are like bells
I hear a symphony
When disillusioned is a fragrance that sells
I hear a symphony

You are not alone
You are not alone
I swear this burden is not your own
You are not alone

In the subway of a slow dark pain
I hear a symphony
In the eyes of an old Polish woman on that train
I hear a symphony

In the echo of a muscle that fled
I hear a symphony
In the sheets of a big and haunted bed
I hear a symphony

You are not alone
You are not alone
I swear this burden is not your own
You are not alone

From the seagulls at the garbage dump
I hear a symphony
At the Ritz Carlton Sanitarium
I hear a symphony

In the bunting of corruption and fate
I hear a symphony
In a language that shows your age
I hear a symphony

You are not alone
You are not alone
I swear this burden is not your own
You are not alone

In the sparkle of a young girl's eye
In the exclusive footage of a suicide
In the ambition of astronauts
In this Eden of tinsel and rot

But I don't need to tell you how it went
Except that all things beautiful are blurred into sadness

I need your little hands to hold my expression
'Cause I've been cursed until the kingdom comes
To always have and miss someone
To always have and miss someone

It was one bedroom with a dog in the thorn
I remember thinking about dad as I was walking out the door
Looking back seeing the girl you never should be
Heartbroke and poor lovesick and lonely

Sadly love, know it will really let you in
I need your little hands to hold my expression
'Cause I've been cursed until the kingdom comes
To always have and miss someone
To always have and miss someone

Matthew Ryan,"Door swings shut, keys are cold
Engine cranks and hums
Pull away, feeling slow
By and by, in the hollow

Don't fool yourself, it's hard and soon
Life alone will humble you

Red lights blur, the rain in sheets
It's black above and blue beneath
All my life, ""Rabbit,"" they said
""If you weren't so quick you'd be dead""

Don't fool yourself, it's hard and soon
Life alone will humble you

Thick red hair, sunken eyes
Round as pearls, dim as bar lights
Where a haunted sound can always be heard
In even the truest of laughter

Don't fool yourself, it's hard and soon
Life alone will humble you",Rabbit
Matthew Ryan,"Darling
Stop confusing me
With your wishful thinking
Hopeful embraces
Don't you understand?
I have to go through this
I belong to here
Where no one cares and no one loves
No light, no air to live in
A place called hate
The city of fear

I play dead
It stops the hurting
I play dead
And the hurting stops

Its sometimes just like sleeping
Curling up inside my private tortures
I nestle into pain
Hug suffering
Caress every ache

I play dead
I play dead
I play dead
I play dead",After the Last Day of a Heatwave

My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn

So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

Matthew Ryan,"Has the future come
To make a liar out of me?
Every day I wake
And I'm further out to sea

High above the driving nails
Swirl the gardens of relief
A broken smile, a little grace
For no longer how brief

The little things, the little things mean everything
The little things, the little things mean everything

Now I'm off to work
On the train I only stare
There's a sleepy drum
And there's corruption in the air

Only souls have been lost
Desperate is as desperate does
A little push, a little shove
A little talk I give myself

The little things, the little things mean everything
The little things, the little things mean everything
The little things, the little things mean everything

I bask in ol' blue
Your skin does too

I took the pills
You'll murder me I know you will

That you were hopin'

For some medicine

You must return to me

You hunkered down and lived the past
You're leaving soon

I see a black car
I'm movin through time
When will we part

A cluttered mind

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew is Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Matthew Sweet,"You don't know how you move me
deconstruct me and consume me.
I'm all used up, I'm out of luck I am star struck
By something in your eyes
that is keeping my hope alive.

But I'm sick of myself when I look at you 
something is beautiful and true.
World that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try.
I'm beginning to think
maybe you don't know.

I'll take a leave, the room to breathe 
The choice to leave it
I'll throw away a chance at greatness just to make this
dream come into play
I don't know if I'll find a way

Matthew Sweet,"There's a smog moon, in the amber sky, wavering and burning like a golden lie.
I fell so far, I didn't think I'd make it back
We are all made, as an afterthought,
Destined to believe that we are what we are not
I'm afraid, but I don't need to tell you that

There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like

There's a lost man, with a bitter soul, Only for a moment,
Did life make him whole
And while he was, he thought he was invincible

There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white

They're not your words, but you're reciting the lines
You don't mean a thing, but you exist in their minds
How does it feel, when they have turned out the lights?
'Cause you know they sooner would get rid of you, than fight.

And the dark night, has the strongest pull
We both know that staying young, can take its toll
Are you afraid of finding out you're over that

There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white

Don't sleep it all away 

So I jumped into my car and hit the freeway 
Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

Well the moral of the story is 
Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning 

It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

Cause It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

It's not the end, it's not the end, 
Still not the end, it's not the end, 
I betcha wonder when this song is gonna end
But it's not the end 'cause I'm singing this song 
And I get to decide when it's the end
And it's not the end , well it's altmost the end, 
Guess you could say it's nearing the end
But it's not the end, it's not the end,
It's not the end, now it's the end",The End

Matthew West,"Three o'clock
Tripping down the sidewalk
Looking like a fool with a pocket full of questions
I was living in the worry
Moving in a hurry
In the wrong direction
But then
Suddenly it hit me
Doesn't really matter 'cause I got you with me
I think I don't have to be so
Down, down, down, down, down

I should be happy
I should be happy
I should be living up these days
Just like I know who runs this place
Now that you found me
I should be happy

Three thirty
Got a little dirty
Fear stuck its foot out and I tripped on the same lie
That voice screaming into my head
Pushing me to play dead
Saying ""don't you even try""
But how can I claime to be free
When I carry more chains the world when they see me?
I don't wanna be the fool who stays
Down, down, down, down down

I should be happy
I should be happy
I should be living up these days
Just like I know who runs this place
Now that you found me
I should be happy

Now I'm not talking 'bout a smile so fake
While the world takes pictures 24/7
I just want my faith to be a little more real
What you see is what you get
What you see is how I feel

I should be happy
I should be living up these days
Just like I know who runs this place
Now that you found me

I can't seem to keep it from spinning

I talk and talk and still I say nothing
Am I the voice of my generation?

There is a place my spirit wants to go
It's far away from all these chains that bind
There is a world I long to leave behind

So, I wait and wait
I wait for the moment when you come for me
And rescue my heart from the pain that it's seen
Troubles are circling all around me
And I can't stop thinking

Just a few more days I'll be going home
Just a few more hours and I'll be flying
It could be any minute now
That You take me away
Or maybe just a few more days
A few more days

To You a day is like a thousand years
And only You know when the clouds will clear
So, let me not forget and fall away
Because a thousand years could be today

So, I'll wait and I'll wait
And I'll wait for the moment
When you come for me
And rescue my heart from the pain that it's seen
My troubles are circling all around me
I've got to remember

Just a few more days I'll be going home
Just a few more hours and I'll be flying
It could be any minute now
That You take me away

Your tricks have fooled me for the last time
You know I've had it up to here
With the way You bring me down, down

You're wreaking havoc on my world
You're calling question to my sanity
But I'm not gonna let You get the best of me
Not anymore, anymore

So here I go, watch me run
A million miles under the sun
That's what I'll do if that's what it takes
To get away

I gotta get away, I gotta get away
I gotta get away, I gotta get away

You try to steal away our kids
You try to tear apart our families
You bring Your lies into our towns
And watch our morals tumble down

We are a city on the edge
We are a world that needs a remedy
But we're still the nation under God
And it's time we take a stand

We gotta get away, we gotta get away
We gotta get away, we gotta get away

Give us Your strength to run from evil Lord, lead the way
Lead us into a better day give us hope, give us faith
Help us, oh Lord, to get away, hear our cry everyday

Well, it's just like a child, a new born baby
There were no two, the same tiny toes, finger prints
And with that thought I rest my case

When we wonder why, I still know You're there
When the nights are long in a world gone wrong
There's still a feeling so strong that tells me You're there

You're so undeniable
You're so unconfidable
And your love is so reliable
It tells me You're there

Ten years old and beautiful 
She's a living, breathing miracle

She was coming in last place 
But she crossed that finish line

As if to say 

God bless the last ones (x2) 

Maybe the last ones are the lucky ones

Matthew West,"I remember when I was thirteen
I saw a picture on my T.V. screen
The Reverend Billy Graham and the people singing
Just As I Am And it felt like
You were talking to me
And the whole world seemed to fade away
Until I heard my mother say
""Son, are you okay? Do you wanna pray?""
And that became the hour I first believed

[Chorus:]
Next thing you know I'm high and flyin'
Next thing you know My heart is in your hands
Next thing you know There's no denyin'
Next thing you know I'm a brand new man

Well, I wish I could say
I always stayed right there
And I did until my freshman year
But the world was pulling me a long way from thirteen
And you were calling but I didn't hear
Still I knew there was something more
So, one day my knees hit the dorm room floor
I said, ""If you're there, and if you really care
Come and talk to me like I was thirteen""

[Chorus:]

Got a picture in my head today
Of how heaven might look someday
I see the people there
So I pull up a chair
And their stories, they blow me away
'Cause I can see it on every face
The evidence of grace
And as I listen it occurs to me
Everybody's got their own thirteen

You gotta find your place in the history of grace
Yeah, what's your story about His glory?

I got as much as I could 
And I went to the store 
And I bought it all 
But it wasn't enough 
'Cause I wanted some more 
But my house was full 
So I bought a bigger house 
And filled it up 
And there I was with all that stuff 
And empty 

Nothing else can take the place of You 
It's true 
Nothing else can take the place of You 
I know it's true 

Still I try friendship 
I called everyone I knew 
And invited them over for a party 
They ate all the free food 
And they told me how much they loved me 
But when the food was gone 
My friends were gone 
And there I was all alone 
And empty 

Nothing else can take the place of You 
Nothing else 
Nothing else can take the place of You 
I know it's true 

So take the place 
The place of you 
And fill this space 
The way you do 
I'm tired of searching 
Those days are through 
So take the place 
It's made for you 

Not friends or money or alcohol 
None of these things, believe me 
You can try them all 
Not status 
Not success 
I know none of these things

Where the grass is thick and green 
But your feet are on familiar ground 
Frozen and afraid of what you might lack

Come on, step out of time 
Fall out of line 
Leave a mark they can't erase 
Find your heart and lose your mind 
Watch the journey unwind 
And let it be a new day 
Out of time 

How's your story gonna read 
When they call your name 
And it's all there in black and white? 
Will you follow or will you lead? 
Will you quietly disappear 
Or is this whole world gonna know 
That you were here?

Matthew West,"I take the pieces of my broken heart
I place them in Your hands
'Cause I need answers and I need reasons
But only You could understand

Right now I feel like these walls are closing in
And I?d give anything to feel Your peace within

Higher than the rain could ever find me
And I would reach, reach beyond the stars
Into a place where love will last forever and beyond

For every trial that I am facing
Only brings me back to You
'Cause I believe in a place called Heaven
Where all my hopes and all my dreams will come true

And every tear will be a million miles away
But until then I will be dreaming of the day

When I will reach, reach above the clouds
Higher than the rain could find ever me
And I will reach, reach beyond the stars
To a place where love will last forever and beyond

And let Your spirit carry me
You lift me up into the sky

And may all who seek Him
Find the grace enough to stand

To a heart that's too weary to try

May the hope of Heaven
Touch a life with healing hands

Will know His love

Worst storm you ever did see 
Next Sunday morning when no church could be found

Matthew West,"How many times can a heart be defeated
Before it decides to give in
How many times can a soul be mistreated
Before being locked up within

Some days I wish I could make myself cry
And I wonder if maybe this well has run dry
But just when I think my emotions are too numb to feel

That's when You open wide my heart
I can feel You open wide my heart
And I know just the touch of Your hands lets the healing begin
I feel Your river of love rushing in
When You open wide my heart

Each day I stand at the foot of this mountain
And pray for the courage to climb
When I am weary lead me to the fountain
That quenches my thirst every time

Lord, You are the water, my reason to live
When I feel like I have nothing more left to give
Oh, and just when I think I have fallen too far from Your grace

That's when You open wide my heart
I can feel You open wide my heart
And I know just the touch of Your hands lets the healing begin
And I feel Your river of love rushing in
When You open wide my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah

And You lift me up again
Lose my ground
And You bring me back again

Because I don't act like everyone

I can hear them say 

I'm a sellout 
I'm a loser 
I'm a yes-man 
And I guess I'm never gonna live it down

I must say that my first inclination 
Was to save my reputation 
Try to blend right back into the crowd 
But the more and more I tried to hide 
The less and less I could deny 
The truth was screaming at me clear and loud 

I gave up the fight 
I guess they were right

I'm a loser

And I guess I'm never gonna live it down

Matthew West,"It was an ordinary morning
At the school upon the hill
The sun was slowly rising
The flag was standing still
And the students were rushing to face another day

But in the middle of the madness
There was one who made her way
She was standing by the flagpole
But she bowed her head to pray
And she said ""I, I will not be afraid""

She said, who will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
By God's grace, who will stand?

Now everyone was watching
Staring at the girl
Some of them were laughing
And calling her a fool
And they said, ""She, ohh she will stand alone""

But then one by one they stepped out
And one by one they came
Breaking form their silence
With a simple act of faith
And they cried, ""We, oh, we are not ashamed, no""

And we will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
By God's grace, we will stand

And we will stand up for what we believe
We will stand up for our freedom
And we'll stand up for one nation under God
With liberty and justice for all

We will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love

We will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
And by God's grace, we will stand

We will stand, we will stand, together
And by God's grace, we will stand
Heart to heart, hand in hand
We are not ashamed to stand

Heart to heart, hand in hand
We are not ashamed to stand
Heart to heart, hand in hand
We are not ashamed to stand

And now it's you in the mirror
But you don't recognize your face
And you're looking for a reason
Not to throw it all away

Just go back, go back
To the moment of truth
With three words 'it's a girl'
And she looks just like you

And when this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose
Go back, just go back

You got your hand on the Bible
But your heart feels like stone
'Cause you think that you've made
Too many mistakes to come home

And you're losing your will
And you're losing your faith
And now you wonder
If you even believed in the first place

Just go back
To the moment of truth
When you first talked to Jesus
And He reached out for you

He's still reaching
He's still reaching out for you

What have you got to lose?

The telephone's ringing
The lights are all on and the radio's screaming
A million distractions are stealing my heart from You

I'm tired and empty
This life is relentless
It weakens my knees and it breaks my defenses
It's wearing me down and I'm desperate to hear from You

Stop the world, I wanna get out
I need an escape away from this crowd
Just to hear You speak to me

I need to be still before I make a move
And I need to be humble with nothing to prove
And I need Your Word to show me the truth
I need time, precious time

Stop the world, I wanna get out
I need an escape away from this crowd
Just to hear You speak to me

Stop the world, I'm ready to listen
Show me a sign, just give me a vision of Heaven
That I can hold on to
Stop the world, I need some time with You

Before I can find my voice
I need to hear Your voice

Matthew West,"I'm the one with two left feet,
standing on a lonely street,
I can't even walk a straight line.
And every time you look at me,
I'm spinning like an autumn leaf,
Bound to hit bottom some time

Where would I be without someone to save me,
Someone who won't let me fall?

You are everything that I live for,
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me,
With arms wide open, all I know
Is everyday is filled with hope
'Cause you are everything that I breathe for,
And I can't help but breathe you in, and breathe again,
Feeling all this life within, every single beat of my heart

I'm the one with big mistakes, big regrets,
And bigger breaks than I'd ever care to confess.
Ah, but you're the one who looks at me
And sees what I was meant to be,
More than just a beautiful mess.

Where would I be without someone to save me,
Someone who won't let me fall?

You are everything that I live for,
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me,
With arms wide open, all I know
Is everyday is filled with hope
'Cause you are everything that I breathe for,
And I can't help but breathe you in, and breathe again,
Feeling all this life within, every single beat of my heart

You're everything good in my life,
Everything honest and true
And all of those stars hanging up in the sky
Could never shine brighter than you

You are everything that I live for,
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me,
With arms wide open, all I know
Is everyday is filled with hope
'Cause you are everything that I breathe for,
And I can't help but breathe you in, and breathe again,
Feeling all this life within, every single beat of my heart

You are everything",You Are Everything

You have the power
To give someone hope
Far beyond their wildest dreams

What if I told you it’s right there in your hands?
In your hands

It's hard to imagine
How something so small
Can make all the difference
Tear down the tallest wall

What if December looked different this year?
What if we all just

Give this Christmas away
If there’s love in your heart
Don’t let it stay there
Give this Christmas away
And your life will be changed
By the gift you receive
When you give this Christmas away

It’s feeding the hungry
It’s serving the poor
It’s telling the orphan
You’re not forgotten anymore

It’s doing what love does
Even when no one’s watching you

Give this Christmas away
If there’s love in your heart
Don’t let it stay there
Give this Christmas away
And your life will be changed
By the gift you receive
When you give this Christmas away

So we could be His hands, His feet, His love
His love

What if I told you?
You have the power
To give someone hope
Far beyond their wildest dreams

What if December looked different this year?
What if we all just

Give this Christmas away

Don’t let it stay there

I saw a carboard sign, said 'Help this homeless widow'
Just above this sign was the face of a human
I thought to myself, 'God, what have I been doing?'

Is so that we would not lose hope
And maybe the reason for all hope
Is so that we could face the world

Is to make us long for home, home, home,

Yeah, yeah

I'm going to break my heart for what breaks Yours
Give me open hands and open doors
Put Your light in my eyes and let me see
That my own little world is not about me

What if there's a bigger picture
What if I'm missing out
What if there's a greater purpose
That I could be living right now
I don't wanna miss what matters
I wanna be reaching out
Show me the greater purpose
So I can start living right now
Outside my own little world, ooh
My own little world, yeah
My own little world, ooh",My Own Little World [Acoustic] [*][Version]
Matthew West,"It's almost Christmas time, everybody
And I can't wait

I left the lights up all year ‘round
I just couldn’t bear the thought of takin’ ‘em down
I’ve been singing “Jingle Bell Rock” since July
All the neighbors look at me like
I’m crazy but I
I, got a feeling that I just can’t shake
You see it’s lasted three hundred sixty four days
And now I’m too excited, I can’t sleep a wink and
I stare at the snow outside my window just thinkin’

Come on, Christmas
I don’t know why you’re taking so long, Christmas
Well, I’ve been waiting all year for you to get here
And I can’t take another second, can’t you hear me beggin’
Hurry up, Santa Claus
Here’s my number just in case your reindeer get lost
I sure wouldn’t mind, if you’re early this time
So, come on, come on, come on, Christmas
Come on, Christmas

Well, there’s just something about this time of year
You can feel the excitement in the air
Everyone’s hangin’ with family and friends
And it’s making you feel like a kid once again

Steal a kiss under the mistletoe
While old Bing sings, “Let It Snow, Let It Snow”
The only thing that’s left on my Christmas list is
I’m hopin’ to catch a peek of old’ St. Nick

Come on, Christmas
I don’t know why you’re taking so long, Christmas
Well, I’ve been waiting all year for you to get here
And I can’t take another second, can’t you hear me beggin’
Hurry up, Santa Claus
Here’s my number just in case your reindeer get lost
I sure wouldn’t mind, if you’re early this time
So, come on, come on, come on, Christmas

Hearts are racing all around the world
Smiling faces on the boys and girls
Waiting just to hear those sleigh bells ring
Singing, come on, Christmas do your thing

Come on, Christmas
I don’t know why you’re taking so long, Christmas
Well, I’ve been waiting all year for you to get here
And I can’t take another second, can’t you hear me beggin’
Hurry up, Santa Claus
Here’s my number just in case old Rudolph gets lost
I sure wouldn’t mind, if you’re early this time
So, come on, come on, come on, Christmas

(Hearts are racing all around the world)
Hearts are racing
(Come on, Christmas)
Come on, Christmas
I can't wait any longer
And the feel is getting stronger
So what you're waiting for?
Come on, come on, come on, Christmas","Come On, Christmas"
Matthew West,"Here comes the letdown Christmas is over
Here comes the meltdown, there goes the cheer
But before we have a breakdown, let us remember
The light of the world is still here

Happy day after Christmas
And merry rest of the year
Even when Christmas is over
The light of the world is still here
The light of the world

Come January I’m ready for summer
The Super Bowl’s over and I’ll settle for spring
Sometimes we all need a change in the weather
But it won’t change the reason we sing

Happy day after Christmas
And merry rest of the year
Even when Christmas is over
The light of the world is still here
The light of the world
The light of the world
The light of the world

So take down the stockings, take back the sweaters
Take down the lights and the star and the tree
But don’t let this world take your joy after Christmas
Take joy to the world and just sing

Happy day after Christmas
And merry rest of the year
Even when Christmas is over

Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Matthew West,"I think of loved ones who've passed away
And I pray they're resting in a better place
I think of memories of years gone by
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

I think of soldiers across the sea
Sometimes I wonder why it's them instead of me
But for my freedom they give their lives
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope
I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know
There is peace on earth for every heart to find
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

I think of family, I think of home
And say a prayer for those who spend this time alone
Cause love can reach out into a silent night
And that's why Christmas makes me cry

Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope
I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know
There is peace on earth for every heart to find
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

I think of Mary and the virgin birth
And I'm amazed by how much God thinks we are worth
That He would send His only Son to die
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

Tears of faithfulness and tears of hope
I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know
There is peace on earth for every heart to find
And sometimes Christmas makes me
Oh, sometimes Christmas makes me
Christmas makes me cry
Christmas makes me cry",The Heart Of Christmas

Matthew West,"Well, it’s been real nice living way up here
In paradise, over the atmosphere
But I can’t stay long, gotta make my way
I’m leaving Heaven today

You see the world is dark and it needs a light
I’m gonna hang a star in the eastern sky
So everybody’s gonna know where I touch down
I’m leaving Heaven right now

I’m gonna walk around that broken Earth
Trading in these streets of gold
So if you ever wonder how much you’re worth
You should know
That you’re the reason why I’m leaving Heaven

Ain’t gonna be no kingdom, ain’t gonna be no crown
Just a little old manger, in a little old town
But it’ll do just fine for this humble King
I’m leaving Heaven let all the angels sing

I’m gonna walk around that broken Earth
Trading in these streets of gold
So if you ever wonder how much you’re worth
You should know
You’re the reason why I’m leaving Heaven

And when my time comes to an end
I’ll lay down my life like a truest friend
And when I get back home, I’m gonna make some room
So, don’t you worry, ‘cause I’m coming back for you

And you will say goodbye to that broken Earth
You’re gonna walk on streets of gold
And if you ever wonder what my love is worth

Matthew West,"O, holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior’s birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
‘Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His Gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy Name

Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine","O, Holy Night"
Matthew West,"It’s the news that no one hopes for
Every parent’s greatest fear
Finding out the child you love so much
Might not make it through the year

Now the thought of spending Christmas
Without him just feels wrong
They’ve been praying for a miracle
Now they’re praying he can just hold on

For one last Christmas, one last time
One last season when all the world is right
One more telling of the story
One more verse of silent night
They’d give anything so he could have
One last Christmas

Middle of September
Still seventy degrees
Daddy climbs up in the attic
Brings down candles
Hangs the lights on all the trees

Then the neighbors started asking
And pretty soon word got around
First it was the neighborhood
Before too long they lit up that whole town

For one last Christmas, one last time
One last season when all the world is right
One more telling of the story
One more verse of silent night
They’d give anything so he could have
One last Christmas

Twenty-seventh of October
His time was wearing thin
Friends and family, even strangers
That they didn’t even know
Brought presents in
He was weak but he was smiling
Like there was nothing even wrong
They said he wouldn’t make it
Looks like he got to see it after all

One last Christmas, one last time
One last season when all the world is right
One more telling of the story
One more verse of silent night
They gave everything so he could have
One last Christmas

Matthew West,"I woke up this morning
Saw a world full of trouble now, thought
How’d we ever get so far down, and
How’s it ever gonna turn around
So I turned my eyes to Heaven
I thought, “God, why don’t You do something?”
Well, I just couldn’t bear the thought of
People living in poverty
Children sold into slavery
The thought disgusted me
So, I shook my fist at Heaven
Said, “God, why don’t You do something?”
He said, “I did, yeah, I created you” (now listen)

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something, yeah
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Oh, it’s not enough to do nothing
It’s time for us to do something

I’m so tired of talking about
How we are God’s hands and feet
But it’s easier to say than to be
Live like angels of apathy who tell ourselves
It’s alright, “somebody else will do something”
Well, I don’t know about you
But I’m sick and tired of life with no desire
I don’t want a flame, I want a fire and
I wanna be the one who stands up and says
“I’m gonna do something”

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something, yes it is, come on
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Oh oh, it’s not enough to do nothing
It’s time for us to do something

We are the salt of the earth
We are a city on a hill
We’re never gonna change the world
By standing still
No, we won’t stand still
No, we won’t stand still
No, we won’t stand still

Matthew West,"It’s the hardest thing to give away
And the last thing on your mind today
It always goes to those who don’t deserve
It’s the opposite of how you feel
When they pain they caused is just too real
Takes everything you have to say the word

Forgiveness, forgiveness

It flies in the face of all your pride
It moves away the mad inside
It’s always anger’s own worst enemy
Even when the jury and the judge
Say you’ve got a right to hold a grudge
It’s the whisper in your ear saying set it free

Forgiveness, forgiveness
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Show me how to love the unlovable
Show me how to reach the unreachable
Help me now to do the impossible
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Help me now to do the impossible
Forgiveness

It’ll clear the bitterness away
It can even set a prisoner free
There is no end to what its power can do
So let it go and be amazed by what you see through eyes of grace
The prisoner that it really frees is you

Show me how to love the unlovable

Matthew West,"I was stranded in shadows
It was all I ever knew
I was pushed down in the darkness
Lost all hope of breaking through
There’s no life inside that prison
No windows, just these walls and chains
But love was on a mission
And I never will forget the day
You woke my heart up
You made me brave
You lifted my eyes
And called me by my name
Come on, come on out of the darkness
Come on, come on out of the night
No more, no more living in the shadows now
Step into the light
When I was shaky, You were steady
Like a lighthouse off the coast
Always
Willing, always ready
To lead this wandering heart back home
And now I still got bruises
And scars don’t lie
But they’re the proof that
I got a second chance at life
There’s a break in the clouds
The sun’s raining down
It’s calling me out
This is my hallelujah
Night turns to day
All my fear melts away
I lift my hands up and say
This is my hallelujah
Come on, come on no looking back now
Come on, come on run for your life
No more, no more living in the shadows now
Step into the light",Into the Light
Matthew West,"Whoever said you can’t go back
Whoever sold you a lie like that
Whoever said you could fall too far
Did you forget whose child you are
Well, truth is I’ve been counting the days
‘Til My tear stained eyes see your beautiful face
And I leave every light on to lead you home
So come home, come back home
Love stands waiting for your return
Love stand hoping you’ll come
back from wherever you were
When you can’t stand on your own anymore
Love stands waiting
So what are you waiting for
Guilt steals any hope of your return
But grace heals all the bridges burned
So drop that heavy load you bare
Yesterday’s behind you, so leave it there
Don’t you know how much I love you, come back home
Don’t you ever stop believing",Love Stands Waiting

Close my eyes and I’m chasing a younger me

How come no one protected
The little girl that the world rejected”

Recognize my voice

But once again our pride
Is the only one that’s winning
And I wish that we could just rewind

I know it looks too far beyond repair
But I believe love can be restored
If we take a little less this time
And give a little more
So hold on to me, I promise you we’ll make it through this
Stronger than we’ve ever been before
Let’s be the proof that love can be restored
Now we could choose the easy way
Like people do these days
Go and find another meant to be
But I, I don’t want somebody new
This heart belongs to you
So baby, don’t give up on me
By now we’ve learned enough to know
That we can’t fix this on our own
So take my hand and say a prayer with me
Lord, bring what’s broken back to life
Help this husband love his wife
Only You can save this family
I believe love can be restored

And give a little more

But I was holding your heart when

The wrong, the too far gone
We are the outcasts, yeah, but today we belong
We are the lost, the found, the been knocked down

The maker of the stars, the stars
You don’t have to wonder
You are wonderfully made
Perfectly beautiful in every way

You’re anything but typical it’s true
They ain’t seen anybody quite like you
God never makes a mistake
You are wonderfully, wonderfully made
See, once upon a time
There was a secret place
Where heaven’s hand designed
Even those freckles on your face
Some things you’d rather trade
Some things you try to fix
Love has one thing to say
It’s perfect just the way it is, just the way it is
So the world could see the works of God on display
So let your doubts and your fears and your questions fade away

Well, I just couldn’t bear the thought of
People living in poverty
Children sold into slavery
The thought disgusted me
So, I shook my fist at Heaven
Said, “God, why don’t You do something?”
He said, “I did, yeah, I created you” (now listen)

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something, yeah
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Oh, it’s not enough to do nothing
It’s time for us to do something

I’m so tired of talking about
How we are God’s hands and feet
But it’s easier to say than to be
Live like angels of apathy who tell ourselves
It’s alright, “somebody else will do something”
Well, I don’t know about you
But I’m sick and tired of life with no desire
I don’t want a flame, I want a fire and
I wanna be the one who stands up and says
“I’m gonna do something”

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something, yes it is, come on
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Oh oh, it’s not enough to do nothing
It’s time for us to do something

We are the salt of the earth
We are a city on a hill
We’re never gonna change the world
By standing still
No, we won’t stand still
No, we won’t stand still
No, we won’t stand still
No

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now
It’s time for us to do something

Matthew West,"She said, ""Dear Matthew, I spent most of my life in a downwards spiral, it's true
Always feeling like there was just no way out, no matter what I've tried to do
When I finally hit rock bottom, when I heard them lock me up behind those bars
And it kills me to say I gave birth to my daughter there"" 
And in that moment it wrecked my heart

But I found that you can find hope
In the hopeless places
And when you're hanging at the end of your rope
Man, that's where grace is

Anything anything anything is
Anything is possible
I believe that the one I believe in
He is the God of the impossible
'Cause love can fix a busted heart like mine
Put it back together every single time
Turn my mess to a miracle
Anything is possible

She said, ""Fast forward six years later
And then sometimes I still can't believe my eyes
I went back to school, I got a job and a new house
God has blessed me with a beautiful life
And I look at that little girl every morning when I wake up
And those eyes are so blue that they are the proof that no matter what never give up.""

Just when you thought it never could
Love's working all things for the good
So lift your eyes up to the one who makes a way
Where there was no way

She said, ""Matthew, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
It ain't perfect but it must be told 
'Cause there is somebody out there with the odds stacked against them
So write my song and let them know.""

Matthew West,"All my life, I've been searching for the answer
For the answer to the question
Where are you?

Up all night
Tryin' to see into the future
Hoping you were somewhere out there searching too

Not a smile and shy hello and say goodbye to life as you know it

Now I'm not asking questions any more
Found the reason he was putting on this earth
Every heartbeat pounding inside my chest
Telling me we were born for this
For this perfect moment and every moment after
For this first day of forever
Eyes-closed kiss, we were born for this

A thousand miles walking in the wrong direction
Turns out I was always headed straight to this
Place in time, all the pieces finally did arrive
When you take my hand it feels like I am home

Not answer to a prayer, I see you standing there, not life as you know it

Now I'm not asking questions any more
Found the reason he was putting on this earth
Every heartbeat pounding inside my chest
Telling me that we were born for this
For this perfect moment and every moment after

Love keeps no record of wrong, no, no

That it doesn't mater what you've done or where you've been
You don't have to keep going back there again

And write it down one last time
Go on and raise your hands, let the list fall down
You know that you are a new creation now

Cast your sins as far as the East is from the West

Zu spaet, um schnell noch beizudreh'n

Waren uns gleich so vertraut

Meistens leise, manchmal laut
Wir nannten uns zwar 'alte Kumpel'
Doch keiner hat's so recht geglaubt

Ich hab geträumt von dir (ich hab geträumt von dir)
Jetzt bin ich aufgewacht
Und trau mich nicht zu fragen denn du könntest ja sagen
Dass dir das total nicht passt ich hab geträumt von dir

Ich habe eine Problem wie sag ich's meinem Kind
Wie kann ich dir erklärn dass wir ein Traumpaar sind
Vielleicht wärst du bei sowas andrer Meinung
Ich fliege viel zu hoch ich bin zu nah am Licht
Ich brauch 'ne Landebahn doch die ist nicht in Sicht
Ich bin total verliebt und muss doch schreien

Viel zu spät und immer wieder lass ich dich dann gehen
Ich kann sowas nicht sagen kannst du mich nicht verstehn

Ich hab geträumt von dir (ich hab geträumt von dir)
Und wieder durchgemacht
Jetzt rebelliert mein Magen denn ich muss dir was sagen
Und ich hab Angst dass du lachst
Ich hab geträumt von dir (ich hab geträumt von dir)
Jetzt bin ich aufgewacht
Und trau mich nicht zu fragen denn du könntest ja sagen
Dass dir das total nicht passt ich hab geträumt von dir

Und jede Nacht der gleiche Traum, ich seh dich vor mir stehn
Du lachst und sagst dann leis zu mir „Hey man lass uns gehen“
Ich hab geträumt von dir ich hab geträumt von dir

Ich hab geträumt von dir (ich hab geträumt von dir)

Matthias Reim,"All die Schatten der Vergangenheit
Die soviel Licht entzieh'n
All die Traeume gingen viel zu weit
Fiktionen ohne Sinn
Und was immer ich auch tu'
I'm Mittelpunkt stehst do
Wir tanzen auf dem
Maskenball - I'm Taumel der Verlogenheit
Maskenball - und glauben an Geborgenheit
Do, ich habe es schonmal erlebt
Und kenne das Gefuehl
Ganz allein vor einer Wand aus Eis
Als der Vorhang fiel
Und jetzt steh'n wir wieder Hand in Hand
I'm leer'n Theatersaal
Wir sind Spieler unter Publikum
Und spiel'n das Spiel nochmal
Was immer ich auch tu'
I'm Mittelpunkt stehst do
Wir tanzen auf dem
Maskenball - I'm Taumel der Verlogenheit
Maskenball - und glauben an Geborgenheit
Maskenball - von Angesicht zu Angesicht
Maskenball - diese Wahrheit gibt es nicht
Maskenball - Spiegelbilder Deiner Welt
Maskenball - die viel verspricht, doch gar nicht haelt
Maskenball - ich hab' das schon mal erlebt -
Ich hab' das schon mal erlebt....

Und da waer' soviel, dass es fuer immer bleibt
Ich wollt' Dir glauben, ich wollt' es tun
Und ich hab' Dich gefragt, ob do Dir vorstell'n kannst
Ein ganzes Leben lang nur noch mit einem Mann...
Do sagtest:""Logisch"", do wollt'st es tun
Selten so gelacht - niemals so geweint -
Selten so verliebt - doch niemals so allein
Und das ist jetzt gerade mal drei Wochen her
Do warst voll mit Power, doch jetzt geht nichts mehr
Was ist geschehen - was ist passiert?

Als kenn wir uns ne Ewigkeit 
Darin haben wir und dann verloren 
Und finden kostet zeit

Bitte geh nicht weg 
Bitte geh nie wieder wieder weg 
Hey ich hab mich so auf dich gefreut 
Mein ganzes Leben lang 
Hab ich von sowas nur geträumt 
Hey ich hab mich so auf dich gefreut 
Mein Leben fliegt mir um die Ohr'n 
Ich kann's nicht ändern tut mir leid 
Als wir uns dann traffen 
Eigentlich war es viel zu spät 
Du und ich das passte nicht zusammen 
Aber soviel wir uns verstehen 
Wir trauten kaum uns anzusehn 
Jeder Blick war schon zu viel 
Es kann nicht sein was nicht sein darf 
Und dabei waren wir nun am Ziel.

Wir ließen es geschehn 
Wir haben uns getarnt
Und hatten immer das Gefühl 
Das jemand anders für uns plant.

Der Bauch hört gar nicht hin

Das hat doch keinen Sinn.

Wiedermal geht gar nichts mehr.
Wir dreh'n uns I'm Kreis; es ist aus
Ich weiß!
Doch kapieren
Das fällt uns so schwer.
Es kann doch nicht wahr sein
Will nicht in den Kopf 'rein.
Himmel
Was ist denn hier los?
Mit so viel Gefühlen
Zwischen den Stühlen;
Trotzdem
Wir lassen nicht los!
Sag mir
Warum
Ist es nicht mehr wie früher?
Warum sind da and're Gefühle?
Warum steh'n wir hier
Seh'n uns an
Und bleiben doch stumm?
Sag mir warum?
Hab'n wir uns so verändert?
Warum ging das alles zu Ende?
Wir haben doch geschwor'n
Daß uns so'was niemals geschieht.
Auseinandergelebt!!!
Ich möcht' dich umarmen
Dir so vieles sagen
Und wiedermal krieg ich's nicht hin.
Ich könnte jetzt schreien:
Wie wär's mit verzeihen?
Ich spür'
Das hat auch keinen Sinn.
Nun dieses Schweigen
Hilfloses Schweigen;
Bitte
Bloss jetzt nicht geh'n!
Das sitzt doch so tief; ich hab' dich so lieb!
Ich word' das wohl niemals versteh'n!

Im Morgengrauen, der Weg nach Haus' 
Du bist nicht hier, ich flippe aus

Dieser kurze Moment, reine Energie 
ich hab mir so gewünscht, reale Phantasie 
und so ein bisschen Magie war bestimmt im Spiel 
Du warst so bezaubernd, vielleicht ein bisschen zu viel

Kann ich das glauben, ist das hier wahr 
Hab ich das alles nur geträumt, und du warst gar nicht da?

Ich möcht' dich noch einmal sehn 
möchte dich wiedersehn 
ich möcht' dich noch einmal sehn 
und noch einmal küssen oder so

ich möchte nicht, dass man erkennt 
das ich gerade an dich denk

was ist nur los, uh, das geht zu weit

Sowas kenn ich von mir gar nicht, doch da stehst du drauf
Hab die Fotos von uns beiden auf den Nachttisch gestellt
Und fast jeden den ich Treffe, schon von dir erzählt
Von den Augen die mich anschauen, tiefblaue See
Und von meiner Lust da irgendwann drin unter zugehen
Wie lebendig plötzlich alles ist, seit Du in meinem Leben bist

Deine Liebe macht mein Leben neu
Nicht ein Tag geht ohne Glück vorbei
Keine Stunde, keine Sekunde
Ich sag nie wieder, es gibt keine Wunder

Jeder Tag mit dir ist schwerelos

Ich sag nie wieder es gibt keine Wunder

Zehnmal mal am Tag ruf ich von unterwegs bei Dir an
Und frag dich jedesmal sag hey wie gehts
Wär am liebstem mit dir nur noch zusammen daheim
Wär doch schön ich könnt jetzt einfach so Frührentner sein

Nichts und niemand kann mich jetzt noch aus den Wolken holen
Dein Lachen fegt meine Traurigkeit weg

Wenn nichts mehr geht
Geht immer noch irgendwas
Solang ich steh´
Solang geb´ ich auch Gas
Der Weg ist steil
In meinen Himmel rauf
Doch das ist mir egal
Ich bin nun mal so drauf
Ich geb´ nicht auf

Ich bin ein Träumer und ein verdammter Optimist
Und ich bin der Letzte, der die weiße Flagge hisst
Und mit ´nem letzten Funken Hoffnung
Mach ich noch ´n Feuer an
Ich werd´ was Besseres als dich finden
Ja ich glaube fest daran

Wenn nichts mehr geht
Geht immer noch irgendwas
Solang ich steh´
Solang geb ´ich auch Gas
Der Weg ist steil
In meinen Himmel rauf
Doch das ist mir egal
Ich bin nun mal so drauf
Ich geb´ nicht auf

Matthias Reim,"Es ist mal wieder Samstag
Und dazu auch noch Nacht
Gleich werd‘ ich wieder los ziehen
Bis Morgen früh um acht

Dich suchen und nicht finden
Das macht mich wahnsinnig
Doch irgendwann das spür‘ ich
Find‘ ich dich

Ich hab dich, das ist irre
Einmal erst gesehen
Und trotzdem war´s sofort
Total um mich geschehen
Wir zogen diese eine Nacht
Durch jeden Club der Stadt
Und da hat´s plötzlich bei mir zoom gemacht

Ich fühlte mich wie´n King
Als ich nach Hause ging
Schien Sonne mir warm ins Gesicht
Seitdem such‘ ich nach dir
Und sag‘ ständig zu mir
Verschollen sein kannst du doch nicht

Irgendwo da draußen muss es dich doch geben
Hinter irgendeiner Tür
Irgendwo da draußen da musst du doch leben
Warum versteckst du dich vor mir
Irgendwo da draußen gehst du heut‘ Nacht schlafen
Dort würd‘ ich gern morgen früh mit dir erwachen
Irgendwann wird es passieren
Darum such‘ ich weiter Suche ich nach dir

Mit dir das war so anders
Das kannte ich so nicht
Ich sah uns in deinen Augen
Und ich las in deinem Gesicht
Die Story meines Lebens
Und alles war so klar
Und ich wusste
Dass ich angekommen war
Und als du sagtest Okay
Ich muss jetzt erst mal gehen
Es war schön also bis dann
Ich war sprachlos vor Glück und hab´s vergessen
Verdammt dich zu fragen ja wo nun und wann

Irgendwo da draußen muss es dich doch geben
Hinter irgendeiner Tür
Irgendwo da draußen da musst du doch leben
Warum versteckst du dich vor mir
Irgendwo da draußen gehst du heut‘ Nacht schlafen
Dort würd‘ ich gern morgen früh mit dir erwachen
Irgendwann wird es passieren
Darum such‘ ich weiter Suche ich nach dir

Matthias Reim,"Unterm Mond, letzte Nacht, bin ich neben dir erwacht
Wusste kaum was von dir und du gar nichts von mir
Unterm Mond sah ich dich, ich sah dir lange ins Gesicht
Wirst du bleiben oder gehen? Als wäre nie etwas geschehen

War es nur so ein Glücksmoment
Ein Feuer, das schnell nieder brennt
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

Unterm Mond weiß man nie, zählt ein Wort auch noch morgen früh
Wenn die Sonne wieder kommt, dort am fernen Horizont
Unterm Mond verspricht man viel, was man gar nicht sagen will
Wie sehr du mich jetzt auch liebst, was noch kommt, ist ungewiss

War es nur so ein Glücksmoment
Ein Feuer, das schnell nieder brennt
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

War es nur so ein kurzer Rausch
In denen man Zärtlichkeit tauscht
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

Eine Ewigkeit",Unterm Mond
Matthias Reim,"Da liegt ein Brief vor meiner Tür
Ich heb´ ihn auf er ist von dir
Ich öffne ihn und glaub nicht was da steht

Auf mich fällst du nicht nochmal rein
Das war´s für alle Zeit es ist vorbei
Und werde doch glücklich mit ihr, das schreibst du mir

Bin ich jetzt verdammt für alle Zeit
Mal eben so Ende aus vorbei
Dabei hab´ ich doch wirklich nichts getan

Wer setzt solche Lügen in die Welt
Komm gib mir noch ´ne Chance und hör´ mich an

Sie war sehr süß dass geb´ ich zu
Das ließ mir einfach keine Ruh´

Ich hab sie nur ein Mal gesehen
Ich schwör´ da ist nie was geschehen

Dies ist mein letztes Lied für dich
Doch auch wenn diese Nacht gleich endet
Dass zwischen uns das endet nicht

Geht gleich auch jeder in sein Leben
In seine eigne kleine Welt
In Wirklichkeit kann uns nichts trennen
Weil das mit uns für immer hält

Wir sind unendlich
Wir sind unvergänglich
Und denk´ bitte nicht
Dass ich das nur so sag´
Und morgen früh
Wieder vergessen hab´

Wir sind unendlich
Wir sind unzertrennlich
Und das rede ich nicht bloß so daher
Nein ich weiß , dass es stimmt
Dass wir unendlich sind

Glaub´ nicht ich würde dich vergessen
Wenn ich gleich auf mein Zimmer geh´
Ich wird´ auch dann noch an dich denken
Wenn ich alleine schlafen geh´

Ich weiß es gibt nicht nur ein Leben
Für uns gibt`s sieben oder mehr
Und darum fällt mit auch der Abschied
Von dir heut´ Nacht nicht all zu schwer

Wie´s einen zerfrisst

Was einer von uns zwein verletzt
Uns beiden geht es gut dabei
Ganz einfach nur verliebt zu sein
Ok, für Liebe braucht man n bisschen Mut
Zu alt, zu jung egal es tut uns gut

Und ich schau in deine Augen
Und ich schau dir ins Gesicht

Und ewig Leben kann ich nicht

Mit dir reicht mir diese Reise

Dass wir mal scheitern, Du und Ich

Der ich mit 14 war

Daß ich mal lehrer werde
War damals allen klar

Musik stand überhaupt nicht
Auf ihrem plan

Und wußte, eines tages
Krieg auch ich mal eine chance

Wie kurvenreich
Der weg dorthin auch wird

Ich schwebte oft im freien fall

Und ist Rock 'n' Roll

Immer nur an dich

Verdammt, ich lieb dich
Und ich lieb dich nicht

Doch Pausen zwischendurch sind auf 'ner Rodelbahn nicht drin
Ich musste die Minuten für uns beide oft schon klauen
Und sag mal warum bist du nicht schon lange angehauen?
Ich wollte viel mehr Zeit mit dir, wusste nur nicht wie das geht
Ich hatte ja auch niemals langsamer gelebt

Wenn ich jetzt wie vorher wieder meine Bahnen zieh
Du sagst mir immer wieder lass die blöde Qualmerei
Und wenn das Bier schon sein muss, bitte nur alkoholfrei
Das geht mir rein ins rechte Ohr und aus dem linken wieder raus
Ich hab es ja im Hinterkopf, son Licht geht schnell mal aus
Ich lieb dich auch dafür, denn du gibst einfach keine Ruh'

Wie'n fremder Sturm an dir vorüber gehen
Ich schaff's noch nicht an dir vorbei zu schauen, als wärst du eine von Millionen Frauen
Ich komm ganz einfach noch nicht klar alleine, bin weit entfernt von drüber weg zu sein
Das dumme ist nur, dass ich's nicht kapier
Was zieht mich noch zu dir?

Das Porzellan war alle und die Tränensäcke leer
Es gab nichts mehr zu sagen, denn alles war gesagt

Qui traverse mon corp

Une sensation étrange
De caresses de chuchotements
Paisibles et intenses

Je te tends la main
Pour pouvoir caresser l'ange

La mort se venge

Une douce bise s'avance
M'apportant calme et insouciance
Mon âme entre en danse

Son sourire envieux
Laisse la place
A des gestes gracieux
Qui s'effacent peu à peu

Pourquoi cette larme que tu as dans les yeux
Je pensais que les âmes ne pouvaient être qu'heureuses

Que tu ne m'entends pas

je n'ai pas pris la peine
De me pardonner
de toute façon c'est pareil
j'ai des regrets

Qu'on est bien dans tes bras
Et même si je sais
Que tu ne m'entends pas
Qu'on est bien dans tes bras
Et puis tant pis si je ne dois pas...

Qu'on est bien dans tes bras
Et même si je sais
Que tu ne m'entends pas
Qu'on est bien dans tes bras
Et puis tant pis si tu ne m'aimes pas...",Elle
Matthieu Mendes,"Pourquoi dans votre univers, vous n'avez jamais faim
Pourquoi jamais vous ne vous souciez du prix du pain
Pourquoi est-ce vous qui avez toujours toutes les cartes en main
Est-ce donc un gage d'intelligence que d'avoir les moyens

Ma mère me disait ""il faut que tu ailles à l'école""
C'est le seul moyen pour pouvoir enfin prendre la parole
Il fallait lutter contre vos chefs et leurs auréoles
Pour éviter leurs mines sur nos sols

Pourquoi tu me demandes ça à moi ?
J'en sais rien
J'en sais rien

Mais nous en France nous avons peur de la misère
Quand nous en croisons nous fuyons en regardant par terre
Certes, tout le monde ne peut pas donner son argent
Pourquoi pas un sourire, est-ce que ça nous prend du temps

Pourquoi tu me demandes ça à moi ?

lueurs envoûtantes

Pour Parti ?

Je n'arrive pas à lire l'incinué
Tes efforts pour me reveiller
Et tes sourires j'ai négligé

Mon ange, qu'est-ce que tu attends
Pour Parti ?
Il est encore temps
J'ai peur de ce que je peux dire
Et je ne sais pas comment me guérir

Mes paroles et ces gestes ratés
Ont dû ouvrir en toi une plaie
Tes paupières délicatement fermées
Me font déjà tout regretter

Matthieu Mendes,"Elle est fleur bleue Juliette
Il est grisé Roméo
C'est son poète

Elle porte ses violettes
Des prénoms comme des clous sur la peau

Elle noie dans son verre
Les papillons noirs du jour
Pose sur ses lèvres
Une lame de velours

Parle encore des anges et d'amour ?

Une rose sans épine
Et quelques larmes de Jack
Elle entre en scène
En Camelia

Au bout de la nuit
Elle f'ra courir le diable
Dans tes veines

Son corps à la poésie

Sa mémoire ne dure qu'habillée
Et tous les soirs

Que tous les hommes
Entrent dans sa cage

Accorde-moi une dernière transe,
Laisse-moi dompter ton insolence
Dans une douce violence

Tu te vides de ton sang-froid
Quand de mes baisers je te crible

Besoin du désert, de bottes et de poussière
de confusion entre ciel et terre

De parler à Kant, Marx ou Gandhi

Tends lui la main, danse avec elle

de l'horizon sans fin, inspiré par un demain
sans gène

Là, avançant pas à pas
tu ne m'tiendras pas tête, c'est moi qui tient l'entête
cette fois

Là, mes jambes sont sans réponse
mais tel un automate, sans plus rien que la hâte

d’un opéra choc
un coup de baguette magique 
sur une musique rock

Engoncé coiffé croisé
des jambes à la tête
la foudre a frappé mon siège
le temps s’arrête

Les cymbales se font rares
et la basse tonne
les violoncelles s’enragent
le tambour résonne dans la nuit tel un orage

Comme une dose létale de curare
un trombone
brûle les cuivres de rage
j’étouffe je suis sourd je prends les notes au hasard
assis dans le noir

Assis sans être assis
j’ai perdu la tête
le maitre de cérémonie
Oublie le reste

Suis-je ici ou ailleurs
j’ai ni jambes ni tête
cette opéra dure des heures
que rien n’arrête

Les cymbales se font rares
et la basse tonne
les violoncelles s’enragent

Comme une dose létale de curare
un trombone
brûle les cuivres de rage
j’étouffe je suis sourd je prends les notes au hasard
assis dans le noir

La lumière se fait rare
les gens se bastonnent
se tirent  des cordes des yeux
il pleut dans la salle
et pourtant je me sens heureux

pendant que je m’envole
perdu au fond des cieux
une musique qui meurt
peut rendre tant gens heureux

"Mattias ""IA"" Eklundh","We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

Take a risk, take a chance for once in my life
I think it's time I come alive, & this time I don't need a reason why

And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Maude Maggart,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended (But the Melody Lingers On)

Can't go anyplace,

You had a lot of chances to make things right

Maura O'Connell,"Baby, I know that we've got trouble in the fields
When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out

I toss and I turn
'til I'm all tired out

I'll be fine

What else did we leave undone?

J'étais celle qu'ils aimaient fort 
Bleue. 
J'étais, je suis encor
Bleue
Vais-je garder l'éclat, l'or ?
Mes chagrins d'automne d'alors ?
Mes danses de pluie au dehors ?
Bleue
Mais les neiges se font rares.
Toutes mes saisons s'égarent
Chauds... les courants qui nous séparent
Glacées... vos colères de hasard
Devant se défait notre histoire

Pourquoi m'êtes-vous infidèles ?
Vous plantez de l'acier dans mes ailes
Rappelez-vous de la tour de Babel !
Nous sommes liés d'éternel.

Pour s'aimer et rêver encore",Bleue
Maurane,"Il y a d'autres essences 
L'invisible est chargé d'imprévisible 
D'une poussière qui pense.... 
Les parfums du silence,
Sont sensibles et subtils
Tout est possible
Dans cette transparence.
J'aime cet inconnu,
Ce ronronnement chaud de jamais vu.
Si léger dans les airs
L'invisible a tant de vertus, de lagunes
Ruminant nos chimères.
Le pire ou le meilleur
Je ferai tout ce qui me chante...dans la lune
Mon amovible sur....
J'aime les heures nues,
Les nuits qui tournent...rond
Les rives impromptues.

L'invisible est hanté d'imprévisible
D'esprits malins qui dansent...

Je ne peux pas regarder où déposer les pieds
Et toujours me protéger
Pour que, gentille, lissée, tout mal puisse glisser
Sur moi sans m'écorcher
Je veux être troublée inventée, révoltée
Pour tout prendre et tout donner
Je ne veux pas préserver des conforts trop sucrés.
O Modus Vivendi

Il faudrait
Que je filtre des mots à peine dits
Que je n'parle pas de tout
Que je n'aie pas d'avis....je le sais
Je devrais vivre sans émotion, surtout sans passion,
Vaille que vaille
A vous tous, parallèles, sur nos vies, sur nos rails.

Entre ce qu'on attend de nous
Et ne pas se mettre à genoux
Etre ce qui nous ressemble
Et pourtant, vivre ensemble.

Tu as senti la nuit venir
Tu es parti avant la fin
Le dernier acte était le pire
J’ai le beau rôle et c’est très bien

J’hésite entre Médée, Hermione
Ariane par l’amour blessée
Vodka, king size et je rayonne
Seule enfin sur le canapé

Pourtant j’aimais tes sillons bleus
Et tes iris de citron vert
Les nuits blanches, l’oiseau de feu
Et nos amours fous de plein air

On se lasse de tout mon ange

Je n’aime pas qu’on me dérange
Longtemps des brillantes banquises

Tu as dû voir la nuit venir
Tu es parti avant la fin

Je m’aime plus que tous les rois
Je parade avec mes bijoux
Et mon noble péplum de soie
Je suis le meilleur des joujoux

Enfin seule sur les tapis
Ravie je joue à la poupée
Jaguar au collier de rubis
Au fond des longs miroirs glacés

Pour le meilleur et sans le pire
Je vais reprendre mon envol
Avec mon hermine et ma lyre
Bye bye chéri bye bye guignol

Green as spearmint,
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coatracks,
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos,
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes,
Light and noise
And bees and boys
And days

Maureen McGovern,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

And a smile can hide all the pain

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near

Maurice André,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind (from the film The Thomas Crown Affair (1968))

To be in love with you.
Beautiful! You're so beautiful,
You haunt me all day through.

Every little breeze seems to whisper ""Louise.""
Birds in the trees seem to twitter ""Louise.""
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew.
But to be so near you,
Thrills me through and through.

Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you Could love me, Louise?


Innocent! You're so innocent
And gentle as a dove.
Heaven sent! You were heaven sent,
An angel from above.

Every little breeze seems to whisper ""Louise.""
Birds in the trees seem to twitter ""Louise.""
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Often when I'm gloomy
And in my lonely room.
Thoughts of you come to me,
Like a sweet perfume.

Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you Could love me, Louise?

Il était une fois
Tout là-haut sur un toit
Un maçon qui chantait sa romance.

Un p'tit fait peut avoir d'importance.
Comme il me reste à vous prouver comment,
Je vais commencer par le commenc'ment.

Un maçon
Chantait une chanson
Là-haut sur le toit d'une maison,
Et la voix de l'homme s'envola
Pour se poser par là
Comme un oiseau sur la
Voix d'un autre maçon
Qui reprit la chanson
Sur le toit voisin de la maison
Et ainsi commença l'unisson
De deux maçons et d'une chanson ! son ! sons !

De maçon en maçon,
De pignon en pignon
Et de rue en ville et en village,
La chanson prit son vol,
Et dans sa course folle
Accrocha tous les échafaudages.
Le bon vieux curé se mit à danser,
Parce que dans le pays tout entier

Refrain :

Mill' maçons
Chantaient une chanson
Tout là-haut sur le toit des maisons
Ça leur donnait du coeur au boulot
Les matériaux
Tout seuls !
Semblaient monter tout seuls !
Et les maisons
Poussaient comme des champignons
Ça faisait la joie des compagnons
Qui chantaient avec tous les maçons
Tout là-haut, sur le toit des maisons.

3
De chantier en chantier
Tous les corps de métier
Travaillaient et chantaient en cadence.
Le soleil dans le ciel
Trouva tout naturel
De rentrer à son tour dans la danse.
C'est alors qu'il m'est venu cette idée,
Vous n'en ferez que ce que vous voudrez :

Refrain :
Si tout l' mond' chantait comm' les maçons
Si chacun apportait son moëllon,
Nous rebâtirions notre maison
Qui deviendrait, Bon Dieu !
La maison du Bon Dieu !

Notre chanson
Serait la plus bell' des chansons
Et quand viendrait la belle saison
Nous serions des millions de maçons
A chanter sous le toit d' nos maisons !",La Chanson du Macon

Font notre originalité

Maurice Chevalier,"Sweet one, fairer than the flowers, 
Never will I meet one sweeter than you. 
Would you turn away or could you 
Really every care, If I'd ever dare 
To say, ""I Love you.""? 

If the nightingales could sing like you, 
They'd sing much sweeter than they do, 
For you brought a new kind of love to me. 

If the Sandman brought me dreams of you, 
I'd want to sleep my whole life through, 
For you brought a new kind of love to me. 

Bridge: 
I know that you're the queen, and I'm the slave, 
And yet you will understand 
That underneath it all 
You're a maid, and I am only a man. 

I would work and slave the whole day through 
If I could hurry home to you; 
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

Là-bas, tout au fond de la Chine
Vivait un puissant mandarin
En compagnie d' sa mandarine
Chinoise garantie bon teint
Le mandarin austère et grave
Avait pour nom Kéktufoula
Sa femme s'appelait Fleur-de-Nave
C'est pas courant mais c'est chinois

Un jour, il partit en voyage
En laissant sa femme au logis
Et la belle au cœur très volage
S'amouracha d'un de ses coolies
C'était un Nippon fort bel homme
Malgré son p'tit air effacé
Il portait un nom à la gomme

Bien qu'il fut coolie agricole
Il n'avait rien d'un va-nu-pieds
Car il sortait d'une grande école
L'école des Nippons déchaussés
Un soir, au jardin, sous les branches
La mandarine se donna
Le Nippon s'en paya une tranche
Bien sûr, c'est jaune et ça n' sait pas !

Au bout de neuf mois, elle fut mère
D'un amour de poupon nippon
Mais le père s'était fait la paire
L' coolie avait fait ses paqu’sons
Et quand, de retour de voyage, 
Le mandarin vit le lardon
Il s'écria, bouillant de rage
Je suis un mandarin citron !

Hélas le pauvre homme, ô supplice
Fut si frappé par ce coup là
Qu’il en attrapa la jaunisse

C’était vraiment du superflu
On peut se passer de la jaunisse
Quand on est chinois et cocu !

Et voila l’histoire est finie
Et le pauvre Kéktufoula

C’est que, lorsqu’on est mandarin
Faut surveiller sa mandarine
Sans quoi l’on y trouve des pépins.

Pourquoi le ciel en plein hiver
Comme au printemps prend l’air de fête
Pourquoi dans un charmant concert 
Les oiseaux chantent à tue-tête
D’où vient ce grand charivari

C’est tout simplement que Paris
Devient majeur 
Qu’on se le dise
Petit à petit

De telle façon qu’aujourd’hui

D’être encore le vrai bouquet de terre

Maurice Chevalier,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man
Maurice Larcange,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?
Maurice Larcange,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind
Maurice Larcange,"Je l'ai cherchée partout j'ai fait le tour du monde
De Venise à Java de Manille à Hankor
De Jeanne à Victoria de Vénus en Joconde
Je ne l'ai pas trouvée et je la cherche encore

Je ne connais rien d'elle et pourtant je la vois
J'ai inventé son nom j'ai entendu sa voix
J'ai dessiné son corps et j'ai peint son visage
Son portrait et l'amour ne font plus qu'une image

Elle a cette beauté des filles romantiques
Et d'un Botticelli le regard innocent
Son profil est celui de ces vierges mythiques
Qui hantent les musées et les adolescents

Sa démarche ressemble aux souvenirs d'enfant
Qui trottent dans ma tête et dansent en rêvant
Sur son front, ses cheveux sont de l'or en bataille
Que le vent de la mer et le soleil chamaillent

Je pourrais vous parler de ses yeux, de ses mains
Je pourrais vous parler d'elle jusqu'à demain
Son amour, c'est ma vie mais à quoi bon rêver?
Je l'ai cherchée partout je ne l'ai pas trouvée

Il pourrait nous parler de ses yeux, de ses mains
Il pourrait nous parler d'elle jusqu'à demain
Son amour, c'est sa vie mais à quoi bon rêver?
Il l'a cherchée partout il ne l'a pas trouvée

Est-elle loin d'ici? Est-elle près de moi?
Je n'en sais rien encore mais je sais qu'elle existe
Est-elle pécheresse ou bien fille de roi?
Que m'importe son sang puisque je suis artiste
Et que l'amour dicte sa loi",La Chanson de Maxence
Maurice Larcange,"What now my love, now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes
And my hopes turn to bits of clay?

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where that sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live if I should live or die

What now my love, now there is nothing?
Only my last, my last good-bye",Et Maintenant
Maurice Larcange,"The summer smiles the summer knows 
And un-ashamed, she sheds her clothes 
The summer smoothes the restless sky 
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie 

The summer knows the summer's wise 
She sees the doubts within your eyes 
And so she takes here summer time 
Tell the moon to wait and the sun to linger 

Twists the world round her summet finger 
Let you see the wonder of it all 
And if you've learned your lesson well 
There's little more for her to tell 
One last cares it's time to dress for fall",Eté 42

She's my heart and soul that overflows forever
Reaching endlessly into my dreams

(And I gotta say)
Oh my the lady is love
Her heartlight blesses me with love
All night the lady lifts me up
Oh my, the lady is love

Precious pearl, once a girl, now a lady
With a gentle smile she moves my world
Like nature's child, free and wild, and I love it
On this special night I know she's mine
The light in you takes my breath away
Oh I can feel it
Love gave a reason every way
I want to give my heart to you

Oh my, the lady is love
Her heartlight touches me with love
Every night she keeps my faith in love
Oh my, the lady is love
The lady is love
Every night she will be my love
Oh my, the lady is love

You are my heartlight
Thelight in your heart baby
Takes my breath away
The light in your heart baby
Oh the light in your heart
Oh send a light to my heart baby
Take my breath away",Lady Is Love

Ho un nodo in gola che è difficile mandare giù
Fumo un po', sposto via la tenda
Cielo grigio piombo io non lascio che mi prenda
La nostalgia che sale lentamente come mai
Io penso a te mi chiedo adesso dove sei, cosa fai
Chissà se tu avrai mai pensato a me
Al nostro fuoco che bruciava e mo' è cenere
Ma tutto passa piano e pure se fa strano
Io sorrido perché so che oggi non ti chiamerò
Quel che viene venga e mi sta bene
Quel che è stato è già passato e mo' il passato se lo tiene
Piove già da un tot
La pioggia bagna la mia pelle ma mi asciugherò
Perché so che il tempo è ciclico
E so che un po' di tempo è quello che ci vuole
Mentre un guaglione sta scacciando il male, sta aspettando il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami, risplendi e scaldaci
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione 

E oggi è come ieri
Ma forse è un'impressione frutto della mente di un guaglione
Sarà che non c'è il sole
Sarà che tutto sembra resti uguale
Sarà quel che sarà, sono preso male
Ma nessuno chiama e non so chi chiamare
Cerco di schiodarmi e penso solo a quello che ho da fare
Uh, Gesù, sono io la vittima dei demoni
Che tornano e che vengono a tirarmi giù
I miei cattivi pensieri che mi aspettano braccano 
Parlano e parlano, dove sono i raggi che scaldavano un guaglione?
Dove sono gli altri della mia ballotta mo' che sono nel ciclone?
In dopa trovo la mia cura
In dopa mischio le radici e la cultura e ho energia pura
La musica mi detta le parole
Caccio queste rime e so che prima o poi ritorna il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami, risplendi e scaldami 
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione 

Vada come vada e va da sé
Conto solo su di me e già so che già sai che
Chico fa quel che s'ha da fare quando amore non c'è
Devo imbustare perché in tasca manca mone
Sempre più difficile restare calmo in questa situazione
Sclero, non ne voglio più
Parto da zero, so che in qualche modo devo andare su ma
Non c'è più luce, solo buio che fa male
Non c'è più pace solo rabbia che ogni giorno sale
So bene dove sono e adesso voglio stare qui
Sentire il beat, se sei all'ascolto vieni a prendermi
Rapiscimi, musica colpisci al cuore
Boom cha, boom cha, però non c'è dolore
Distendi le tue mani guaritrici su un guaglione
Mentre sta aspettando il sole, ayo

It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Mauro Negri,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Mauro Negri,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Mauro Negri,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

Mauro Ramos,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El DĂ­a Que Me Quieras
Mauro Ramos,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón 
para olvidar un loco amor 
que más que amor es un sufrir

Y aquí vengo para eso, 
a borrar antiguos besos 
en las besos de otras bocas 

Si su amor fue flor de un día
¿Porqué causa siempre es mía 
esa cruel preocupación? 

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
para olvidar mi obstinación 
y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado 
y pensar que otro a su lado 
pronto, pronto le hablará de amor 

¡Hermano! Yo no quiero rebajarme
ni pedirle, ni llorarle, ni decirle 
que no puedo más vivir

Desde mi triste soledad 
veré caer las rosas 
muertas de mi juventud. 

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris, 
quizá a ti te hiera igual 
algún amor sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche 
sola y triste en esta noche, 
noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo 
aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
para ahogarlo de una vez

Quiero emborrachar al corazón 
para después poder brindar 
por los fracasos del amor

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración

Maury Finney,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I might have known I'd never make a wife

I can see how bad
All the crazy boys, behave for you.

How can I be your friend

Maverick Sabre,"I can still taste you on my lips, your tenderness
You always gave me something
The way you made me feel before you left
See you're jadin' me, dazin' me
And I just wasn't ready, cash on, walk out on today
Oh Lord, still you always keep me wantin'

Oh, let me go, you let me down
When I'm with you, I'm broken now
You made me feel, you understand
With you I won't be, a better man

Got too many reasons why I can’t

The safest place for hiding

I can't face it, I'm wasted
And you never speak
When that's all I ever need

Oh Lord, you picked me up so many times
But now you just break my soul
No more, I tried to stop loving you
But I don't really have control
Oh Lord, no matter how hard I try
I always end up on this road
Oh, still you always keep me wantin'

Oh, let me go, you let me down
When I'm with you, I'm broken now

Without money to show and to represent us

Every time you smile I wonder why
Every time you say you love me, lie
Every time we touch I break inside

Theres no change anymore but the way that it makes us
Locks us up everything becomes to hard to fight against

Is everything is hurting and I don't think its worth it
I never say I'm perfect cause I'm far from
I just absorbed every word and we don't deserve this
I takes our empowerment and makes us worthless

But were searching everywhere just for a wage to give us purpose
And if I die then I wont take a dollar with me
In the ground see no pounds in my pocket sitting

Hands behind his back strapped tight keeps him quiet but he wasn't ever violent,
Officers scratching off their numbers so they can't be identified or ever get in trouble.
Please understand the struggle it's like no where there's the love,

It don't make sense when I see rapists getting sentenced less then men who rob,
To send their kids to school with food in their belly and a roof over their head 
And sheets to keep them warm in their bed.
They shot an innocent man they, on the tube last year,
So tell us how we're not supposed to fear if I get stopped and searched 
For the way that I look and then charged with a crime that was never ever due.
I've seen my mum crying tears when they mention the year behind bars 
For what they said that I did but they could never convict.

Where concrete is over trees and all dreams get cut and bleed
Walking free, when I was young I used to duck and weave
Playing up in Clissold Park and laughing in that London breeze
'93, I was a three year old with many schemes
Junior playing football skills of Arsenal just like they call me
Sticker books remember wrestling the young'n takin' I was phased
Used to idolize when he gave you a break-up
I was in a nursery making story cakes, fell in love
For the first time I remember days
When I was bullied, beat up, then kicked and slapped away
Clutching on the monkey bars and hoping they'd all go away
Loved them city sounds and sirens in the dark at night
Helicopters fly above my head, I'd never get a fright
I loved them early days, living in that constant noise

I was scared of startin' school again; will some be all rude again?
Beat me up and treat me like a fool again.

Growin' up a ? an outsider never settled quick
Settling was hard when you're treated like a lump of shit
Saying you were black and tan and come for what you fucking did

Got in scuffles screamed out loud sayin' shit like maybe they were right

I had no friends that I could ever rely on
I was sittin' back, watchin' through the haze of that road on that beaten child
But keeping that evil intact
I put the beat to track

Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down",For What It's Worth [Live]

On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rollin'
For to take my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky

For this body you are haulin'
Lord, I hate to see her go""

Missed my mother she was gone

In our home so sad and alone

By and by Lord, by and by

Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that our mother had taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Wrote a song for truth.

Looks like a new day dawning.
Reach out - it's a leap in the dark,
But there's no danger of falling.
Give out, give it straight from the heart.
You feel like thunder rolling.
I feel a rush in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth moving.
Love is a beacon, a guiding light.
Can't you feel the Earth moving?
Feel the Earth move,
Now I'm wrapped in a sweet love's arms.
Reaching out for you.
There's something magic in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth move.

Max Bennett,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west

'Cause I've got something to sing about it

Don't go for second best baby

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold

Lift you to your higher ground

He'll be back on his knees to express himself

Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love

'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be

Da saß ein Junge in Stuggi
Der was dazutun wollte
Man fand ihn immer, daheim in seinem Zimmer
Nickte mit dem Kopf und schnippte mit der Fingers
Tip, one and two
Oohoo, new leaders of the CS Move
Dabei träumt er, er rappt für die Leute
Auf den Brettern, die die Welt bedeuten
Saß Tag für Tag, schrieb Reim für Reim
Er feilte Wort für Wort und Line für Line
Dann irgendwann traf er ein Kid genannt Martin
Freitagnacht auf 'ner Hiphop-Party
Sein DJ Frico, fragt: ""Willst du ans Mikro?
Und sagt: ""Man hört nur Gutes von dir"" und ich: ""Ditto""
Er droppt den Beat und ich kick den Rhyme
Auf'm dip-dip-ba, so-so-so leicht
Der Kick auf die eins und die Snare auf die zwei
Und ich rapp in das Mikrofon und sag wie ich heiß
Der M zu dem H, das X zu dem H
Die Kids schreien: ""Hurra!"" und die Chicks werfen Bras

Draußen ist Aufruhr, Orient bis Okzident
Nimmt sich Land um Land, Kontinent um Kontinent
Während Al Jazerra, N-TV und Fox es bringen.
Lass ich Gil Scott-Heron aus meinem Boxen klingen
Vom Tahrir zum Plaza del Sol
Auf dem Syntagma skandieren die Massen Parolen
Und es werden immer mehr und sie haben keine Wahl
Schreien Was ist Freiheit,
Die politisch ist und nicht sozial
Und wo die Zukunft,
Die verschütt' geht unter Schuldenbergen
Die sie nie Schultern werden
Und nur an die Jungen vererben.
Irgendwann lässt sich das Dunkel
Nicht mehr bunt einfärben
Irgendwann lässt sich,
Wer unten ist, nicht länger unterwerfen
Und in fernen Straßen blüht der Jasmin

Was wir Beachtung schenken
Und auf was wir uns beschränken
Sie wollen nicht unterhalten, sie wollen uns unten halten

While a new sun is shining

Everybody mingle
Freedom starts within
It’s time my people sing

Und ich sitz' am Küchentisch im kalten Berlin
Mit 'nem Block und ‚'nem Stift
Und kann dem Alltag entfliehen
Und niemand klopft an die Tür,
Hier kommt noch niemand vollziehen
Bilder ziehen vorbei, wie Gil Scott Heron’s Melodien

Elli war 13
Achtundreißig, Berlin Weißensee
Der Vater darf nicht arbeiten, als Kinderarzt
Er weiß nicht mehr wie's weitergeht
Die Mutter träumt von Herzls Altneuland
Palästina, sein Herz hängt an Deutschland
Dem Deutschland Rilkes, Manns und Schuberts
Nicht dem Deutschland, das diese Angst hier zulässt
Er wird sie fortschicken

Die letzten Tage im September
Berlin, Anhalterbahnhof
Sie winkt dem Vater durch die Scheibe und sie fahren los
Er ruft ihr nach, man soll keine Tränen weinen
Wenn man ins Land seiner Väter reist
Sie versteht nicht gleich was das heißt
Lies sie den Vater nicht zurück, eben an jenem Gleis?
Und die Welt verschwimmt vor ihren Lidern
Versinkt im ""für immer"" und ""nie wieder""
Und sie fahren in die Nacht
Sie findet Schlaf, weil sie fühlt, dass er über ihr wacht
Und in ihrem Traum hat er Flügel
Sie träumt er fliegt in den Süden
Fliegt ihr nach in den Frieden
Nach Tel-Aviv, Hügel des Frühlings

Und sie ausgestoßen in diese kalte Welt
Betet zu 'nem Gott den sie in Frage stellt
Während sie die Tage zählt
Die sie den Vater nicht in'n Armen hält
Und sie hegt die Dinge die ihr von zuhause bleiben:
Der Rilke-band, ein paar Kleider, ihre Geige
Auf ihrer Reise, Flucht ohne Zuflucht
Nur diese Furcht vor der Zukunft
Und er wills nicht glauben bis sie nachts vorm Haus sind
Doch sie schlagen und sie plündern, sie verhaften Tausend
Achtunddreißig, Sachsenhausen
Ein Brief aus Tel-Aviv, er ist nur froh dass sie raus sind

Und dieses Heimweh, ob's irgendwann vorbeigeht?
Für das verlorene Land, dort im gelobten Land
Und sie träumt sich weit weg
Und in ihrem Traum hat sie Flügel
Sie träumt sie fliegt aus dem Süden
Fliegt zurück in den Frieden
Nach Berlin, von den Hügeln des Frühlings

Und ich war in Sansibar, in Tokio, ich war in New York
Ich war in so vielen Orten und immer wollte ich nur fort
Und immer hab ich gesucht und nie wusst' ich nie wonach
Und immer musste ich weiter, denn wer stillsteht denkt nach
Das ist Fluch und Segen unserer Generation
Wir suchen nach Liebe und rennen davon, wenn sie dann kommt
Doch, was ist Freiheit, wenn du alleine feierst?
Und, welchen Wert hat Liebe, die nicht währt in Familie?
Man kann nicht immer fliegen, wir sind nicht schwindelfrei
Doch bevor's nochmal in' Brunnen fällt, bringen wir dem Kind schwimmen bei

Wir stehen immer noch und stärker denn je

Was lehrt einen das Leben?
Vielleicht kann man nicht immer gewinnen
Doch wie man verliert, kann jeder selber bestimmen

Und auch wenn das jetzt nicht katholisch klingt
Glaub ich nicht weniger an das ewige Leben

Oder die in dieser Welt schon nach dem Ewigen streben

Da wo gestern noch morgen heute war
Also mit heute der neue Morgen kam

Will mein neues Leben atmen

Sie steigt immer weiter, hoch die Karriereleiter
Immer mehr arbeiten, mehr Menschen antreiben
Der lange Gang durch die Institution
Hier ist viel verlangt, nur keine weibliche Intuition
Immer wieder zur Bewerbung ‘ne Frau vor dir steht
Meint sie: Familie und Karriere, ich glaub nicht dass das geht

Jeden Tag geh ich die gleichen Wege
Und jeden Tag dasselbe Spiel
Und jeden Tag hoff ich es wird was andres geben
Und jeder Tag ist jeder Tag zu viel
Ja jeder Tag zu viel, ja jeder Tag zu viel

Yeah, ah, yeah, aha

Jeden Tag opfern wir die Zukunft für die Gegenwart
Dekadente Lebensart, kennt kaum 'nen Gegenpart
All die Dinge die wir kaufen weil sie billig sind
Obwohl die Dinge, die wir brauchen nicht mal Dinge sind
Sie mal hin wir sind gefangen in ‘ner Sanduhr
Bangen um den Bankenbankschrott und den Standort
Fragen ohne Antwort, als sehen wir's Problem nicht
Wenn Wenige fast alles haben, haben fast alle wenig
Geht’s echt noch um das was wir besitzen
Wir alle sägen am Ast auf dem wir sitzen

Jeden Tag geh ich die gleichen Wege
Und jeden Tag dasselbe Spiel
Und jeden Tag hoff' ich es wird was andres geben
Und jeder Tag ist jeder Tag zu viel
Ja jeder Tag zu viel, ja jeder Tag zu viel

Jeden Tag geh ich die gleichen Wege
Und jeden Tag dasselbe Spiel
Und jeden Tag hoff' ich es wird was andres geben
Und jeder Tag ist jeder Tag zu viel
Ja jeder Tag zu viel, ja jeder Tag zu viel",Jeder Tag Zuviel
Max Herre,"Mit 13 wollt ich singen wie Bob Marley
Jetzt bringt der Junge Conscious Rap so deep wie Bloc Party
Denn der Sound hier war so staubig wie ein Flokati
Step rein, fette rote Laces in mein' Doc Martens
Ich und Marten, das ist Nouvelle Vague
Das ist Jean-Luc Picard trifft Jean-Luc Godard
Das ist Max Herré accent aigu über'm et
Oui, je parle français, non, ce n'est pas de problème
Ich ging von Rolf Zuckowski zu Charles Bukowski
Der Sound schockt wie Stoff, den ihr die Nase hochzieht
Jetzt gibt's 'n Rundumschlag auf'm bum-bum-tschak
Mit dem Blick für den freien Mann wie Kun-Bum Cha
Der Conscious Mutterf? und ich bleib dabei
Steig auf die Große Mauer, schrei' 
""Frei Ai Weiwei!""
Das ist meine Zeit, ich hab keine Zeit
Es heißt mein Reim sei die unendliche Leichtigkeit
Guck wie ich spuck', wenn die Mucke mich hookt
Ruckzuck in deinem Club, wenn mein Booker mich bookt
Ich hab Rap in die Buchstabensuppe gespuckt
Und es juckt mich nicht die Bohne, wenn du Schmock dich verschluckst
Upps (Uh, uh) ich taug' nicht mehr als Projektionsfläche
? was ich ins Mikrofon spreche (Hallo)
Das ist einfach nur meine Sicht der Dinge
Und dass ich wieder rappe, heißt nicht, dass ich nicht mehr singe (La, la, la, la, la)

Oh Baby, wir sind zu Old School
Kahedi Baby, was brauchst du?
Oh Baby, wir sind zu New School
Kahedi Baby, was brauchst du?

Das Licht geht langsam aus
Der Vorhang fällt und die Welt ist nicht mehr drauf
Ich seh' mein' Eizi, mein' Sam, mein' Max
Alle Hände oben, die Hosen auf halb acht
Uh, ich wollte nur da hoch
Hoch auf die Bühne zu den ""Heys"" und den ""Ohs""
Das war genau wie bei Karate Kid
Aus dem Kino raus mit dem ""Ich mach jetzt Karate""-Blick
Rette mich wer kann

Yeah, ah, hör zu

Wer hat noch mal gesagt
Man schätzt nicht wert, was man hat
Und bis man merkt was man hatte ist die weg, die man mag
Ach ja,
Ich glaub mit Worten war ich immer ganz gut
Doch auch für mich gilt was ich sag ist nicht gleich das, was ich tu
Hört zu
Immer meint man dass das Gras woanders grüner sei
Und warum kann man denn im Nachhinein erst klüger sein
Wünscht, für Beziehungen gäb’s einen Führerschein
Punkte in Bad Liebenau, wer ’n Unfall mit der Liebe baut
Ich hab nie geglaubt, dass wir’s einfach hätten
Das Leben kommt nicht mit ‚nem Beipackzettel
Manche Wogen lassen sich nicht einfach glätten
Es heißt, Wärme entsteht an Reibungsflächen
Und es ist nie vorbei bis es vorbei ist
Du hast mein Versprechen

Zu viele Tränen geweint

Ach wie schön ist Panama
Oft merkt man erst wenn man wo anders war
Was man aneinander hat
Und ich war in Sansibar in Tokio, ich war in New York
Ich war an so viele Orten und immer wollt ich nur fort
Und immer hab ich gesucht und nie wusst' ich wonach
Und immer musste ich weiter, denn wer still steht denkt nach
Das ist Fluch und Segen unserer Generation doch
Wir suchen nach Liebe und rennen davon, wenn sie dann kommt
Was ist Freiheit, wenn Du alleine feierst und
Welchen Wert hat Liebe, die nicht währt wie Familie
Man kann nicht immer fliegen, wir sind nicht schwindelfrei
Doch bevor’s noch mal in Brunnen fällt
Bringen wir dem Kind schwimmen bei

Zu viele Tränen geweint
Gedacht es wär vorbei
Doch es ist nicht vorbei, bis es vorbei ist

So vieles tut mir leid
So vieles, was uns bleibt
Denn es ist nie vorbei, bis es vorbei ist
(Glaub mir, es ist nicht vorbei)

Down, go, yeah

Und wir haben Gutes, wir haben Schlechtes gesehen
Von einem ins nächste Extrem das Beste vom Leben
und Nächte voll Tränen
Glück und Pechsträhnen, zwei verletzte Seelen
Doch das konnt‘ uns eins nicht wegnehmen, man wächst an Problemen, yo
Wir stehen immer noch, und stärker denn je
Die Täler durchschritten, die Berge versetzt
Was lehrt einen das Leben?
Vielleicht kann man nicht immer gewinnen
Doch wie man verliert kann jeder selber bestimmen

Doch du schwebst durch den Raum so wie schwerelos
Wenn du siehst was ich seh', oh wär' das groß
Denn oft gibt‘s nur die eine, nur die erste Chance
Und sag mal was ist das, was du in deinem Blick hast?
Denn deine Augen sprechen, auch wenn du nichts sagst
Nennen wir das Schicksal, wenn es jetzt ""Klick"" macht?
Ich flieg in dich hinein, weil dich der Himmel geschickt hat

Es ist dieser Augenblick
Du fällst während du in diese Augen blickst
1000 Meter tief unter der Haut

Lass uns raus hier aus diesem Beton
Und die grauen Wolken, ach schieb' sie davon!
Einfach nur weg und nie wiederkommen
Nimm meine Hand und wir fliegen davon

Max Herre,"Manchmal scheint's als kommt nichts zusammen
du denkst du kommst da nicht rüber
Und plötzlich entdeckst du dieses Lied wieder 
neu und es schenkt dir neue Zuversicht
Das hier war so'n Lied für mich und ich 
dachte ich will's mit euch teilen
Billy Preston hello singers

You are so beautiful (so wundervoll)
You are so beautiful (wunderschön und das ist unser Leben)
You are so beautiful (und sing es für dich selbst)
You are so beautiful (hey du, Hallo Welt!)

Wenn dir das Leben seine Fratze zeigt
Und du denkst du stehst da ganz allein, kann das sein?
Dann siehst du Götter gegen dich verschwör'n
Die Welt, du kannst nicht mehr hör'n
Wenn niemand auf dich baut, weil niemand an dich glaubt
Wenn du mal wieder glaubst, dass dich niemand anders braucht
Vom Pech verfolgt, es scheint als sei's dein bester Freund
Sind deine Tage eher wie Nächte und du hast schlecht geträumt
Dein Boot gekentert, sitzt an einem kaputten Lenkrad
Dann weißt du, dass es Zeit wird, dass sich an dem Punkt was ändert
Lässt dich jemand hocken, komm ich geh Brillien trocknen
Mach's wie Pierre, mach neu! Dir steht das Leben offen
Denn auch wenn Winde toben, Kinn nach oben, Blick nach vorn
Es ist nichts verlor'n, also schmeiß die Flinte nicht ins Korn
Sieh in Spiegel und die Chapman setzt'n Lächeln auf
Sing zu Billy Preston extra-laut

You are so beautiful (so wundervoll)
You are so beautiful (wunderschön und das ist unser Leben)
You are so beautiful (komm, sing es für dich selbst)
You are so beautiful (sing's für dich und sing's für die Welt)

Wenn dir die Welt die kalte Schulter zeigt
Und sie dir einreden, dass du selber Schuld dran seist
Sag's zu dir selbst, dann sag's zu deinen Nächsten
Schrei's in die Welt auch wenn die Dinge manchmal ungerecht sind
Trotz all der Sorgen und Nöte glaub an die Morgenröte
Zwei Herzen, eine Brust Johann-Wolfgang Goethe
Das ist unser Leben und es ist wunderschön
Unsere Zeit, unsere Zukunft und die lassen wir uns nicht nehmen
Ich kann nicht anders als von Hoffnung schreiben
Und ist egal, was all die Zyniker uns prophezeihen
Denn das ist was ich fühle, das ist keine Platitüde
Vielleicht geht's mehr um Haltung, weniger um Attitüde
Für all die hoffnungslosen Optimisten
Für alle die, die noch hoffnungsfroh sind, so wie ich's bin
Am Ende bleibt immer Minimum noch'n bisschen
Aloe Blacc singt's für euch, alle nochmal mitsingen

You are so beautiful (so wundervoll)

Max Herre,"Du kamst in diese Welt als Tochter 
Der Sehnsucht nach sich selbst,
Vida, ein Leben und mein Kind,
Und nur weil Du bist, hat das Leben seinen Sinn

Das Leben fragt nicht, ist diese Welt 
Auch gut genug und kam ich zur rechten Zeit
Weil's immer nur die Zukunft sucht,
Und so zieht es aus, so stolz und so selbstbewusst, 
Stellt sich jedem neuen Tag entgegen mit geschwellter Brust,
Es fragt auch dann nicht, das Leben verlangt
Nach der Liebe derer dem sie's verdankt,
Und wer wären wir dem Leben das zu verwehren
Und die Welt, die ihre ist, mit unserer Last zu beschweren

Es heißt die Kraft eines Baumes liegt in den Wurzeln, 
Und Leben nicht zu lieben hieß' die Triebe zu stutzen,
Nun sagt man auch die Liebe ist wie der Vogel, 
Versuch' sie einzusperren und sie kommt nie mehr geflogen,
Doch gibst Du ihr Freiheit kommt sie immer zurück
Und auf den Flügeln der Zeit schwingt sie ins Licht,
Denn wie der Mond das Licht der Sonne nur spiegelt, 
So spiegelt auch das Leben nur das Licht in unsrem Leben

With these wings you can fly,
I know you gonna need it to get by,
Everything will be alright,

Träum' die größten Träume, nur die soll'n Dir genügen,
Nur der Himmel ist das Limit, flieg' und greif' nach den Sternen,
Kannst alles werden, hast noch alle Zeit es zu lernen,
Seht, jetzt kannst Du schon reden, ne' kleine Charaktere,
Bald bist du alt genug und begreifst was ich erkläre,
Es ist Dein Weg, doch ich bleib' Dein Gefährte,
Hab Mut in Deiner Seele, leb' die Freiheit der Erde,

Vida, das Leben kennt nur das Heute,
Das Gestern wird vergessen und das Morgen sind Träume,
Und doch ist jedes Leben ein Versprechen der Zukunft 
Und nur durch unsere Liebe zu ihm spricht sie zu uns

With these wings you can fly,
I know you gonna need it to get by,
Everything will be alright,
Let these dreams be your guide

Sometimes you may wonder why,
I can't always be by your side,
But when the road gets ruff, times get taff,
Got my love all your life

Sinn und Unsinn des Lebens
Kopf in den Wolken, Kopf im Sand
Hoch geflogen und so oft verbrannt
Alles dreht sich und es dreht sich täglich
Die Kraft in dir trägt und verrät dich
Mann im Spiegel, Hass oder Liebe
Er treibt dich vor sich her und er macht dich müde
Und du willst jemand anders sein, wer kann das sein, mir fällt keiner ein
Und du willst nicht machen, was du machst

Vor all diesen Fragen
Weil es schwer ist die Zweifel
Auf den Schultern zu tragen
Also schließe ich die Augen
Um an etwas zu glauben
Ist es wert dich zu lieben
Und das Leben zu lieben
Hier auf Wolke 7

Dinge kommen, Dinge gehen
Angst vorm Fallen, lieber für nichts mehr stehen
In den Bilderfluten nichts mehr sehen
Und dann mit wehenden Fahnen untergehen
Nachts in Katakomben abfliegen
In Katakonter wieder abschießen.
Und im Gedränge untertauchen
An nichts außer an Wunder glauben
Und du willst woanders sein,
Wo kann das sein, es fällt dir gerade nicht ein
Dicker Schädel und ne dünne Haut
Jeden kennen, aber niemandem trauen
Alles is gesagt und es will keiner hören

Max Lemar,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind

Max Lemar,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Watching everything you do
And I just can't help feeling 
Someone else is stealing 
You away from me

I see it written in your eyes
And you confirm it with your lies
Though the whip you weave can hold me
I would rather that you told me
Where you want to be

Ooh! slipping away from me
Ooh! slipping away from me
And it's breaking me in two
Watching you slipping away",Slipping Away
Max Miller,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Fa show doe
Say Hap, I want to let 'em get a feel of my hood, though
Know what I'm talkin' bout?
Let's do dat..

[Background Voice-Sped up sample; sounds like a small child/woman.]
Ooh la la la
Baby I'm so high
I feel like I'm in Paradise
Your lovin' caught me by surprise
You make me say oooh...
aaah..
I just want to be with you
Be With just and only you
You make me say (Now, now make it Bounce, bounce)
[continues throughout song]

[Max Minelli talking]
Yeah. Bounce, bounce. In my hood
Yeah. Bounce, bounce. In my hood
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We be fuckin' the game up when we do it like this
I love the niggaz in my hood
Yeah, yeah. Know Wha'I'm talkin' bout?
Wan' take a walk though the hood with me?
Come on

[Verse One]
Come take a walk on the wild side, the nigga, foul side
They done shot up the corner, now none the children can go outside
That's how they actin'
Now holla when you bout some jackin'
Boys spillin' them guts and they tryin' to wipe it up with napkins
Back in the game it wasn't quite this tragic
Capture the magic, smokin' on somethin' up in traffic
I'm a step away from bein' psychopathic, tryin' to fall back
Beepin' the weedman, but he ain't never call back
I'm a lifetimer liftin' weights away from being cock strong
But don't let that get ya wrong, I know how to cock comb
I can make beef with ya, or make bread with ya
Duck a fed with ya
Say it with ya
Bust a head with ya
On the same block pops got the blues on
I'm a lil' homie done went to jail, but my shoes on
But I been hustlin' since I had Underoos on
Reppin' for my hood
I'm a fool 'till the tombstone, tombstone
In my hood

[Chorus part 1: 2x]
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
I love the thugs in my hood
I love the broads in my hood
I got much love for my hood

[Chorus part 2]
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
Hah? Yeah. In my hood
In my hood
I got much love for my hood
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
Uh, uh. In my hood
In my hood
I got much love for my hood

[Verse Two]
Say lil' man, let me tell ya what it feel like
What bein' real like
What grippin' wood wheel like
And packin' steel like
Then what duckin' the cops like
What bleedin' blocks like
What ridin' on chops like
And bein' out the box like
At the stoplight, not a worry in the world
Though we all grown up, we still boys and girls
I still hold my own
I'm well known, on a blow up phone
Makin' a deal with the Pope, tryin' to sew up Rome
I had to grow up wrong, but it's safe to say
I stayed focused and I came up in a major way
Pay attention to what you do and all the thangs you say
I ain't trippin', I'm just makin' sure everythangs okay
Countin' days
Think I'm a dog in a two-man cage
I'm on a whole nother page
Gettin' smarter with age
If you want to retaliate, let me be part of the rage
We went from watchin' cartoons to countin' war wounds
In my hood

[Chorus p1 2x]

[Chorus p2 1x]

[Verse Three]
Nowadays
Everybody want to be hard and say they real with that
But catch a case and they don't know how to deal with that
Whatever happened to takin' your lick and takin' your trip
Scorin' all your work soft, then makin' it flip
Now niggaz tellin' on they homeboys, thinkin' they sick
You say you real nigga, be it, stop fakin' this shit
I got G, for niggaz growin' up on me
Smokin' too much weed then throwin' up in the street
A million and one ways to use thug in a sentence
Talkin' on the blow up phone with five thousand minutes
And it's, nothin' sick about hustlin' hard
And a nigga can't even pay you what you're chargin'
And who would I be, to rap about money, jewelry, and cars
And it be grown women ill and children out here starvin'
Still lookin' up to God and I'm hopin' he pardon
My ways, because I gotta get it on like Marvin
In my hood

[Chorus p1 2x]

[Chorus p2 1x]

[Just the voice 4x]
Ooh la la la

I walked by his window.
I could hear him moaning his song.

waiting for the evening mail.

Lordy what a feeling.
Just a mean and low-down jail 
seperating me from every thing but the evening mail.
I'm like a ship without a sail.
But I wrote my one time mama down in Jacksonville
said,'sweet mama I'm in jail.  
Honey please don't fail me.  
Hurry up and mail me bail.'
That was just a year ago.
I'm still in the inside, looking at the outside,

I had a letter handed to me yesterday.
It was from a mama that I met down on mobile bay.
She said, ""honey won't you please send me down some bail.
They caught me fooling around with the evening mail.""

I had another letter from a man named Stout.
Said he was gonna get me as when I got out.
Said now he was gonna meet me right down there at the gate.
Brother he don't know how long he's got to wait.

dici che io non sono male ma
dovrei cambiare un po'…ma vuoi capirla o no?
Non me la menare
non capisco cosa vuoi
tanto lo sapevi
che non ero come voi
a me piaccion le birre scure
e le moto da James Dean
non quelle stronzate
che si dicono nei film
Tu se lo sai mi devi dire se tu
Veramente mi preferiresti se
Io fossi uno di quegli stronzi
Vestiti a festa che si vedono
Dovunque vai nei bar oppure
In discoteca appoggiati a qualche colonna
Che bevono un gin tonic come fosse
Una bella storia, dai…ma vuoi capirla o no?
Non me la menare
non capisco cosa vuoi
tanto lo sapevi
che non ero come voi
a me piaccion le birre scure
e le moto da James Dean
non quelle stronzate
che si dicono nei film
Tu t'incazzi perché parlo sempre di calcio
dici che fra un po' ti verrà il fegato marcio
perché non ti parlo di tramonti lontani
e mangio la pizza solo con le mani
io che mangio quasi solo cose piccanti
tu che dici è meglio che ti lavi un po' i denti
io quando esco sono una bomba
che esplode e che fa boom…ma vuoi capirla o no?
Non me la menare
non capisco cosa vuoi
tanto lo sapevi
che non ero come voi
a me piaccion le birre scure
e le moto da James Dean
non quelle stronzate
che si dicono nei film",Non Me La Menare
Max Pezzali,"Ma perché sei andata via 
Mi son persa nella notte 
perché non m'hai detto che non eri mia 
Non lo so 
sarà il vento o sarai tu 
la voce che risponde ai miei perché 
Dai galoppa più che puoi 
Corri vai non ti fermare 
che di strada ce n'è ancora tanta sai 
Si lo so 
vedo una cantina che 
mi potrà toglier sete e polvere 
Lancio qualche peso al cantinero 
Che non parla mai 
accanto a me c'è un gringo, uno straniero 
mi chiede ""Man, dove vai?"" 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
e forse quel che cerco neanche c'è 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
starò cercando lei o forse me 
Tra deserto e prateria 
Ma perché ti sei fermato 
Ero stanco ed affamato, amica mia 
Si lo so 
le capanne, una tribù 
dal basso lo stregone guarda in su 
""Uomo bianco, vieni qui"" 
Stai attento non ci andare! 
""Posso leggerti il futuro se lo vuoi"" 
Di di no! 
Gli sorrido, dico ""OK"" 
nei sassolini osserva i fatti miei 
Viso pallido, ti sta ingannando 
non la troverai 
sono mesi che stai cavalcando 
dimmi dove andrai 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
e forse quel che cerco neanche c'è 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
starò cercando lei o forse me 
La città è in festa e tu 
Finalmente sei arrivato 
hai lo sguardo scuro non mi guardi più 
Si lo so 
il caballero accanto a te 
perché ti sta abbracciando e guarda me 
Accarezzo un po' la colt 
Dio ti prego non lo fare! 
poi mi giro, guardo il cielo, dove andrò 
Adios, mi amor! 
ballan tutti intorno a me 
sotto i colori delle lampade 
Ed il vento mi sta sussurrando 
non ti fermerai 
c'è qualcuno che ti sta aspettando 
tu sai dove andrai 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
e forse quel che cerco neanche c'è 
NORD SUD OVEST EST 
starò cercando lei o forse me",Nord Sud Ovest Est
Max Pezzali,"Si era detto otto e mezzo puntuali al bar 
Però lo sapevamo già 
Che tra una cazzata e l'altra c'è Cisco che 
Passa in bagno un'eternità 
Tutti in macchina la festa è lontana e poi 
Là le tipe ci aspettano 
Oh ragazzi, ""tranqui"", questa è una botta sicura 
Basta che non ci perdiamo 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
Stiamo volando alla festa 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
E siamo già là con la testa 
E le troveremo già sulla porta e poi 
Con il tacco alto e la gonna corta e noi 
Con il groppo in gola e il cuore che batte 
Le faremo ballare per tutta la notte 
Cisco addoccia la cartina poi dice ""No! 
Stiamo andando fanculo!"" 
Te l'ho detto dovevamo girare là 
Guarda sono sicuro 
Lo sapevo che sarebbe finita così 
Siamo teste di cazzo noi! 
Basta uscire più di dieci chilometri 
Che noi stronzi ci perdiamo

Rotta per casa di Dio 
Ci stiam perdendo la festa 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
E stiamo uscen
Do di testa 
Non le troveremo più sulla porta e poi 
Niente tacco alto né gonna corta e noi 
Con il groppo in gola e il cuore che batte 
Ci faremo menate per tutta la notte. 
Con le facce tese tutti incazzati neri 
E con le pive nel sacco 
Persi in queste strade che sembrano sentieri 
Stanotte niente di fatto 
Avvistiamo da lontano un cavalcavia 
Ci sarà un'autostrada là 
Appena entrati dal casello come per magia 
Ecco appare un autogrill
Rotta per casa di Dio 
Ci siam fottuti la festa 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
Però che notte diversa 
Tutti con in mano birra e Camogli noi 
Senza fidanzate troie né mogli 
Quattro deficienti a fare cazzate 
Come non succedeva da un pacco di tempo. 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
Ma chi la caga la festa 
Rotta per casa di Dio 
Stanotte non l'abbiam persa 
Tutti con in mano birra e Camogli noi 
Senza fidanzate troie né mogli 
Quattro deficienti a fare cazzate 
Come non succedeva da un pacco di tempo",Rotta X Casa di Dio
