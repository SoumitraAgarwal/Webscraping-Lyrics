Stacie Orrico,"No i was just saying that I've said a couple of funny things today
I don't know I was on the phone today and I said that whoever I was talking to 
that thought it was funny.
I'm not a very funny person so i get excited if anybody laughs other than me.

It blew my mind in to a million pieces
Pushed You aside
And still You got my back 
[Chapter 1, Page 1]
This is the part where I got weak
Fell in too deep
Every day and night got
Caught up in the hype
Started getting rough but
'Cause you showed me love I'm gonna..

[Chorus]
Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, get right on track
I'm moving on
Gotta put it in the past
Bounce, bounce back
Snap your fingers and just like that
I let it go
Gotta let it fade to black
Like a river
Cry all my tears
I have to swim through it
Dry it off, I'm outta here
Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, I'm right on track
I'll be moving on

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 

Another day, still playas out to run game
Trying to make me flow
To places I don't roll
(Chapter two, page two)
Happening again
Like deja  vu
But it's brand new
Testing my faith
I won't make the same mistakes
So Playa' drop the drama
I Flipped the script and Now I'm gonna

[Chorus]

Yo, You've been down since the day I've found You
There ain't no way that I can do without You
It's off the chain the way I feel about You
I know I feel astray believe me when I say
This time, this time
I'm gonna be strong
This time, I'm gonna hold on
All this time, I'm gonna, when you forgive a wrong
I'm leaving it alone
Gonna be bounce, bounce, bounce, bouncing on

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back

Stacie Orrico,"Will I always be there for you?
When you need someone, Will I be that one you need?
Will I do all my best to, to protect you?
When the tears get near your eyes
Will I be the one that's by your side? 
Will I be there when you call me in the middle of the night?
Will I keep the rain from falling down into your life?
I promise, I promise
I promise I will 

Will I take tender tender care of you?
Take your darkest night and make it bright for you
Will I be there to make you strong and to lean on?
When this world has turned so cold
Will I be the one that's there to hold? 

Will I be there when you call me in the middle of the night?
Will I keep the rain from falling down into your life?
I promise, I promise

And I love you more every day
And nothing will take that love away

Stacie Orrico,"Verse 1:
I saw him shaking his change in a coffee cup
Asked for a dollar but I told the man to give it up
Said he's hungry, I don't think that it's true
Bet my dollar he gon' spend it on booze
I turned my back on him and began to walk away
But then I heard the little voice inside me say
What if it's really true, what if he's hungry?
What if it's not for him, does he have a family?

Pre-chorus:
How'd you get here?
How'd you end up on the street?
Where did it go wrong?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

Verse 2:
It was 90 degrees in the summer heat
She was veiled in black all the way down to her feet
This is America, doesn't she know?
Somebody take her shopping, buy her some cloths
She came up to me, I didn't understand a word
I was about to leave then another thought occurred
She might be really lost, scared and frustrated
I should try again to see what she's sayin'

Pre-chorus 2:
How'd you get here?
How'd you get so far from home?
What was it that made you leave?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

I would see, oh oh
Oh, see what you see
And I would feel
Oh, feel just what you feel

Chorus (x2)

'Cause I could've lived your life instead (x2)",Instead
Stacie Orrico,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there any way to be made whole again?
If I'm healed, renewed and find forgiveness and find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I finally found

That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh Thank You for my chance to start again",Strong Enough
Stacie Orrico,"I can't get out of bed today
Or get you off my mind
I just can't seem to find a way to leave the love behind
I ain't trippin'
I'm just missin' you
You know what I'm saying
You know what I mean

You kept me hanging on a string
Why you make me cry
I tried to give you everything
But you just give lies
I ain't trippin'
I'm just missin' you
You know what I'm saying
You know what I mean

Every now and then
When I'm all alone
I've been wishing you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back
But you never do
I feel like such a fool
There's nothing I can do
I'm such a fool for you

I can't take it
What am I waiting for
My heart's still breakin'
I miss you even more
And I can't fake it
The way I could before
I hate you but I love you
I can't stop thinkin' of you
It's true, I'm stuck on you

Now love's a broken record
That's been skippin' in my head
I keep singing Yesterday
Why we got to play these games we play?

And still try my best to keep my cool

But it seems not everybody shows
That love is the only way to go
(No, it doesn't matter what you see)
All I want is for love to live
Let's learn to give love

When he is down you should help your brother
When it comes around you should help one another
Help build him up when he's down and out
(Ask what you can)
Do when you see he needs help from another
When it comes around we should help one another
Help build him up when he's down and out

I'll keep trying hard to help you see
Cause I really want to' make you see
Help you understand what love can be

Is there anyway to keep it real
While I try to tell you what I feel
And make sure you really know the deal

Stacie Orrico,"I dreamed,
I was headed down to Puerto Rico
Now I'm feeling like I really gotta go
'Cause I really want to get away and spend some time with you
To get away
'Cause my life is getting kinda crazy
And the only way to make it is to pray
That's why I really gotta get away and spend some time with you

[Chorus:]
Or maybe
(Can't I)
I never want to get down, never want to let you down
(I'm thinking, once I)
Maybe once I get away, maybe put my thoughts aside
(You Save me) save me
(And I thank you) Always
(Now I)
(Live my life) Just for you
(Some say I pray it everyday) Everyday
(And I know You'll always say)
Only you can keep us tight
So I pray with all my might
So I say I'm gonna pray it everyday
And I know you'll always say
Only you can keep us tight
So I pray with all my might

At times,
When I'm running with my crew and on the run
And I'm kicking it all day and having fun
And we know that we should really go and spend some time with you
My mind, it was saying I take on You
So when I'm down and feeling kinda blue
There's a word in my heart that I really want to say to you

Or maybe
(Can't I)
I never want to get down, never want to let you down

Kissin' and touchin', whisperin' in my ear, got me breathin'
Marvin Gaye in the background singin', it ain't helpin'

Now in this moment candles burnin', oh, it's so easy
Got me compromisin' with my sexuality
And I know that you and I have got a real good thing
But when I pause, think it over, it ain't right, gotta tell ya

I can't give it up
Shoulda never started, now we gotta stop
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

I can't give it up
We started a fire, gotta blow it out
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

Boy, what was I thinkin'
When I move like that on your body, bump and grindin'
Can't stop, now got you breathin'
And you ain't in the mood for teasin', heaven help me

And when the moment candles burnin', oh, it's so easy
Got me compromisin' with my sexuality
And I know that you and I have got a real good thing
But when I pause, think it over, it ain't right, gotta tell ya

I can't give it up
Shoulda never started, now we gotta stop
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

I can't give it up
We started a fire, gotta blow it out
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready

And you should know
This is really hard for me
'Cause when I'm with you, boy
I wanna give you everything

But there's much more
Than a night of ecstasy
I need commitment
With a diamond
Then I'm yours to be your fantasy

I can't give it up
I will be your fantasy
Ohh
I can't

I can't give it up
Shoulda never started, now we gotta stop
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

I can't give it up
We started a fire, gotta blow it out

Stacie Orrico,"Tryin' to analyze every angle, situation
Tryin' to find an explanation
'Cause it's gettin' aggravating
Why my relationships never seem to work out
Beginnin' to worry and doubt

If I'm even able to detect he's the one
When this day you're wonderin'
Why I haven't seen the sun
Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
'Cause I'm gettin' tired of the rain

Fallin' on my heartbreak and I
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin'
'Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

Is it me? Am I so complicated?
Is it me? Or is love over-rated?
Is it me? 'Cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it

Is it me? Am I too independent?
Is it me? Not ready for commitment?
Is it me? 'Cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

Maybe I'm longin' for it more than I should be expecting
All the standards that I'm settin', unrealistically I'm gettin'
Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
Because I'm so confused and insecure

'Cause when I know for certain everything is goin' wrong
I permitted to prolong, tried my best to hold on
My Mister Right's probably hangin' round my window pane
While I look through only watchin' the rain

Fallin' on my heartbreak and I
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin'
'Cause every guy turns out to be the same

Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it

Is it me? Am I too independent?
Is it me? Not ready for commitment?
Is it me? 'Cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

Never thought it could be that it's me
Till I realized I'm the only
Common factor and played a big part
In lettin' people break my heart

Never noticin' I was wasting time
Askin' the same thing every time
Who were you with? And where were you at?
Until I took the time to turn and look back

Is it me? Am I so complicated?
Is it me? Or is love over-rated?
Is it me? 'Cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it

Stacie Orrico,"Lately I've been feelin' kinda heavy
Could it be all the baggage I'm carrying
I had a guy who wasn't right
Talk about love and I gotta think twice

I mean, he really worked a number
Up in my mind when I was open
Not just my lover was my best friend
But he stole my heart and kept runnin'

It's either love or life I want it all
But sometimes I may not get all the calls
Will you pick me up baby when I fall?
Keep me safe in your arms

I know, I might be movin' slow
We can pick it up later down the road
It's a bit difficult to give you control
But let's see where it goes

Cause I've been lied to cheated on
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
So won't you come and save me, save me?

I can't trust, the truth be told
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me

Like a reality show but baby
Can you take the drama out my life?
Make me forget all the tears that I've cried

Not long ago
It's still hard
But I try to do the best I can

Understand if
My heart breaks again
It's already done, it's over
Cause I know my heart will never mend

You're gonna make it right

I've been lied to cheated on

Because I used to love her but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Because I used to love her but it's all over now

Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried, she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Stage Dolls,"
When you walked into the room
I found I couldn't even move
There was magic in your eyes
(I tried to hide, then I knew)
You could see inside my mind

There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

When you touched my hand I knew 
That I had helplessly fallen for you
You had cast a spell on me
(I was blinded, but)
You were all that I could see

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

Now the moon is full tonight
So maybe this is why I've lost my mind
But the spell you cast on me
Has made me feel so free
I think we're gonna fly away, up to the stars
And I don't even know who you are
Maybe it's just and old superstition, but,
You're a warlock aren't you?

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight

Stage Dolls,"Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
""Love me do"" I think it was and from there it wouldn't take long
Got himself a guitar, he used to play it every night
Now he's in a rock and roll outfit everything is alright

Don't you know
Johnny told his momma ""hey momma, I'm going away
Gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday""
Momma came to the door with a teardrop in her eye

Johnny said ""don't cry momma smile and wave goodbye""
Don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know

Don't you know that you are a shooting star
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are
Johnny made a record, it went straight up to number one

Suddenly everyone loved to hear him play his song
Watching the world go by surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said ""hey I made the big time at last""

And the look on your face tells it all
You were always the one that was waiting

Handed to you in devil's disguise
You thought you were holding an angel

Would you run if I asked you to stay
Would you cry if I said that I missed you
Sorry is all I can say

Still haunted by old memories
And if the road that I take leads me nowhere

Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said

So I speak to you in riddles
'Cause my words get in my way
I smoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away
'Cause I can't take anymore of this
I want to come apart
And dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said

I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention
Yet I always try to hide
'Cause I talk to you like children
Though I don't know how I feel

If the right thing is revealed

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt
I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface
I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

When all this I was going through
You never took the time to ask me
Just what you could do",Fade

My decision

Attention you couldn't give

Swallows his pride for another hit

Of what you're doing here
If they jumped off a bridge
Would you meet them on the ground?
Or would you try and claim
That it never made a sound

Everyone plays the hand they're dealt
And learns to walk through life themselves
Not everything in life is, handed on a plate
When people think your words are true
It doesn't matter what you do
I sold my soul to get here
How 'bout you?

So you choose to force your hand
What a strange way to make friends
And you always change the rules
So the drama never ends
And you blindly go through life
Judging only by what its worth
Just try not to forget
That the meek inherit earth

Everyone plays the hand they're dealt
And learns to walk through life themselves
Not everything in life is, handed on a plate
When people think your words are true
It doesn't matter what you do
I sold my soul to get here
How 'bout you?

So please don't take offense
This is just a point of view
'Cause I'm the only one who
Will say these things to you

Everyone plays the hand they're dealt
And learns to walk through life themselves
Not everything in life is, handed on a plate
When people think your words are true
It doesn't matter what you do
I sold my soul to get here
How 'bout you?",How About You

I had to stop and sing along
The song they played to say goodbye
A song that gave
Gave me back life

You'll never fade
The words you gave 
My life you saved
Your name was Layne

And on that day a child was born 
To someone who you helped along
And helped see through his darkest times
Because of you, this child, she is mine 

You'll never fade
The words you gave 
My life you saved
Your name was Layne

The words you said
You made me feel like they were all for me
The words you said
They will always be a part of me
The words you said
You made me feel like I was not alone
The words you said
You gave me all the strength to carry on

Blindly look the other way

I can't shake this

Can't change my mind
My troubles are the same
Faces change
The names they are familiar
And the streets I see
Will stand the test of time

Stars still shine
Shine down through the rain

You can almost taste it

It's up to you
The path that you choose
Gotta do something different

And what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is ours

Parking lot, full of cars
It was yours, now its ours
We jackin’ Chevys

While you was up in Foxboro thinking about girls
I was 'round the way on Lincoln Way on bowling ball swirls
Traveling out to Canton with the beats in the trunk
With six switches in the floor to make the ass jump
To make the ass jump, 6 switches in the floor to make the ass jump
We make the ass jump, with 6 switches in the floor to make the ass jump
This for the Chevy rollers who love them heavy motors
Cranking steering wheel columns on Monte Carlo's and Nova's
Taking 12 on the chase, they never gon' pull us over
The streets have been taking over, we ride till we burn the motors
Cutting corners with my guys
Five rides, five bow ties
Crash those, take more rides
From big trucks, to the low rides

Parking lot, full of cars
It was yours, now its ours

Stalley,"Most slippers dreaming through this peace pipe
Praying in the dark hoping that I see light
Trynna stay sharp with a dark vision
Gotta couple heathens with me trynna bombard the system
My man just went to jail and brought a gun charge with him
On top of that other felonies
I told him hold his head I'll make sure he lives through these melodies
I hate to see him trapped, wish these raps could just set him free
Whoever thought selling heart would get you seventeen, that's seventeen
I mean yesterday was everything if there's no hope for tomorrow
And money ain't everything, I can go broke tomorrow
Sometimes I find happiness in a broke down cigar
In an isolated room on this Navajo wall
Mind drifting, smoke disappearing through the wall
I hear the loud voices, that's my homies calling
Open up the windows, let the angels fall in

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets

Got so much on my mind, all these thoughts weaving in and out created design
So intricate like hand spun rugs
They say they talking outside
But I hear no love
I feel the shots in my back
But there's no slugs
I brush the dirt off my shoulders
Wipe away all the mug that's been slung
They say the sword ain't as mighty as the tongue
The horns get the attention
But the war starts with the drum
808s and low ends beating on my chest like King Kong
Gorilla warfare, the force here
You could feel it in the song
All the warrior in this gone
I sip Indian style wrapped' in blankets
Smokin' on the bong, trynna find my inner peace
Jugglin' stone, never take it for granted, what the struggle is for
Cuz through that dark hole life is beautiful, like emeralds and gold
There's diamonds in the dirt, you just gotta dig through some coal

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets

I woke up among the confused, but yawning
The bloodstream came to collect dues this morning
For all the signs we drop, the parachute supplies
Are limited, coated in images
Yet the code of the streets leaves our thoughts with no access
The revenue of colour, all reduced to a blackness
But aside the thought, I can find the calm
That's why we close our eyes to concentrate
The cons debate, against the pros talking first degree
Murder on the clock, they got time to kill
I'm intricate to be up in it
So I defend every minute, cons hoping for dimes to deal
Perimeters occupied by a few chosen
To take heed to the fact a few in here are posin'
On the laws of lies, attracted to the warm like wool
But don't let it get pulled over your eyes
Oh, lord

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars

Cops casing the block trying to lock me
It’s hard here, nightmares
‘Cause I don’t want my kids to grow up here
But it feels like a trap, all I do is trap here
Everyday we hoping fences, dipping on twelve
It’s like we running track here
But I gotta get this pack clear

Ba-balancing flows, to balancing triple beams

Stan Bock,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

Sometimes something gets a hold of you
Like you got hold of me
Cause there's a fire here that's burnin' bright
I shut it out and I refused to believe
Some lonely night you'll see

I got a fire in my heart
That is never gonna die
You say you're never comin' back
But I never said goodbye
With a fire in my heart
I'll keep alive the flame
Now every night I'm lyin' here awake

In the candle light I see your face
I can't believe you'd throw it all away

Cause I just can't let it go
That is never gonna die
I'm the kind who falls in love
I got a fire in my heart

Even though you ask me to
You never make the time at all
To just hang out and be
I know we both got things to do
Nothin' wrong with a career or two
You seem to think your freedom lies
In somethin' you can't be
Oh don't you wonder why
Your world don't keep you warm at night

It's just a little thing called love
It's what your dreams are made of
The way you really feel
To you it's no big deal
It's just a little thing called love

Another day, another ride
In stop and go on the 405
You get to work and force that smile
Hope to reach the top someday
You say you have to compromise
There ain't much in your crowded life
But we can have the things we want
If they're what we really need
Oh don't you wonder why
It feels like somethin' passed you by

I can take everything life gives me but I can't take losing you
If I could do it all over things might be different then yeah yeah, if I could go back and show her if I can do it all over

I'll do it again.

On the open road it gives me time to think things through
About me and you yeah.Out of everyone I'll ever know in a thousands grains of sand there's only one gem

You say love isn't what you needed but I can't stop wanting you
I""ll do it again
If I can do it all over things might be different then yeah yeah if I could go back and show her I can do it all over
Lovers come and go again like autumn leaves in a winter wind but I what I feel will never fade away
I can take everything lives give me but I can't take losing you, if I could do it all over things might be different then yeah yeah if I could go back and show her

Living in an illusion, never joining any dance
Used to be the one, played it like a game
Love is like a stranger, just a face without a name
So don't let go, it's a long, long way down

'cause I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by
I keep falling

Foolish are the ones, who never dare to dream, thinking that they're living but they don't know what it means
It came to me so strong, a vision in the night
It taught me how to love when all I knew was how to fight
So don't leave me now, it's a long long way down

'cause I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by

Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country

Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine
Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be

Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark

And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Hey there

Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice

Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

into the lab to have them check on it

[St. George:] Yeah. You were right
[Chief:] I was right
[St. George:] Yeah. It was a gun

Homicide, Ma'am

I understand you were almost devoured by the dragon, Ma'am

[Maiden:] It was terrible. 
He breathed fire on me 
He burned me already

[St. George:] How can I be sure of that, Ma'am

Why do you do that? Why do you burst out like that? It irritates me.
That irritates me. That irritates me, that's all.

HOLD ON! HOLD ON! Hold on you smart Alec Yankee drummer you!
You can cover up rose, you can cover up yellow, buddy,
But don't you cover up TEXAS! 
Or I'll stick your head through that cotton-pickin snare drum 
And secede from the band so help me Mitch Miller I will!

Stan Getz,"A madrugada já rompeu
Você vai me abandonar
Eu sinto que o perdão
Você não mereceu
Eu quis a ilusão
Agora a dor sou eu

Pobre de quem não entendeu
Que a beleza de amar
É se dar
E só querendo pedir
Nunca soube o que é perder
Para encontrar
Eu sei que é preciso perdoar
Foi você quem me ensinou
Que um homem como eu
Que tem por quem chorar
Só sabe o que é sofrer
Se o pranto se acabar",É Preciso Perdoar

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

Stan Getz,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

And touches with her hand the summer trees,

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

You count every word I say
Over again you might find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

Tapestries of black and gold they're crying
Looking through the windows I am watching you
You as you go by

Turn on a wave of fire
Your pale skin can't turn any whiter
Grab a wheel sing a bitter tune
Never stops to forget you've seen

Walk along a lonely mile
Saw a bird falling at my feet
Crawling like a wounded child
Moving farther out of reach
Don't want to be alone, no
Come on, come on, come on

You count every word I say
Over again you could find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

Stan Getz,"Tall and tan and young and lovely  
The girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes, each one she passes  
Goes a-a-a-h  
When she walks she's like a samba  
When she walks, she's like a samba  
That swings so cool and sways so gentle  
That when she passes, each one she passes  
Goes a-a-a-h  
Oh, but I watch her so sadly  
How can I tell her I love her  
Yes, I would give my heart gladly  
But each day as she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead, not at me  
Tall and tan and young and lovely

And when she passes, I smile, but she  
Doesn't see. She just doesn't see  
No, she just doesn't",The Girl from Ipanema [45 RPM Issue]

Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Stan Getz,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain

That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Shared the body and bouquet

Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Stan Getz,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Joy the day would bring

To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
But thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her

Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right

Take me in your arms and let me cling to you

Let me feel that I mean everything to you

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Such a sweet sweet guy was he!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

How he loved the old race horses,
He would bet them every day.
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay!
He indulged in fancy spending,
Ordered rings, cars and furs,
But alas, alack,
Like a stab in the back,
She found out they were not hers!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,

He got mixed up with a Maisie,
He got mixed up with a Flo,
So Flo shoved him in the river,
He'll not get mixed up no more!
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine,
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy,
No insurance could she find.

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

And still she's in my heart

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Stan Kenton,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue [#]

""Wel, not so good Charlie. My back's gone out and I cut my finger kinda
Gnarly. The job's the same and so's the boss. He's still a big ass and my
Wallet got lost. My wife's sick in bed she says she'll never get well and
All these kids today have gone to hell and all that government paperwork
Caught up with me, had to hire a beancounter for an outrageous fee. And I
Don7t know if the chicken or the egg is to blame, but all things
Considered, I guess I can't complain...""
""Cheer up,"" Charlies said, ""things could be worse.""
""Well, yeah, I know, but did I tell you that my landlord's a cop, my
Neighbor's insane, but all things considered, I guess I can't compalin...""
CHORUS
Out on the water
Where the sailing men all go
The water's high while all the fish swim low
""You know what Bert,"" Charlie said, ""you got the wrong attitude. Sometimes
Life's a big game and tthe paths you can choose. Things may go wrong, but
Ya gotta stand tall.""
""Well I know,"" Bert said, ""but well...that ain't all. My hair's falling
Out, the roof leaks when it rains, but all things considered, I guess I
Can't complain...""
CHORUS
""You know what Bert,"" Charlie said, ""you're a real loser, so I'll see you
Next week if you live 'til then.""
And a Bert walked out on the sidewalk, ten floors up, two men lost control
Of a hoist at just the right time, and a big Steinway grand flattened
Bert like a dime. And as a crowd gathered 'round and asked, what was his
Name? and could it be the chicken or the egg to blame/ Well, the only
Thing heard was that all things considered, he really couldn't complain.
So if you're a loser in life and your gun's out of ammo, just remember
This story about Bert and the piano. 'Cause if you can7t string the bow
And you're clean out of resin, someone may have planned for you a music
Lesson. So keep your eyes to the sky, it could be a brand name, and
Remember all things considered, you really can't complain....

It was something I smelled before
Went through a red light while I spilled my drink
I could feel something sticky on the floor
I said, ""Miss you gotta tell me where yo want to go to,
I can't keep driving 'round the same block.""
Then I crumpled my cup and pulled the gum off my shoe
And then she told me,
""Just shut up and keep your eyes on the ruad...

And just drive,"" she said
""Just drive,"" she said
Well, I watched her grip her hands on the bag in her lap
While I scratched the bald spot on my head
I knew then that my cab was just a getaway car
But I shut up and drove like she said
I took a bite off my donut then I offered her one
I said, ""Lady, are you in a fix?""
Then she reached in her purse and she pulled out a gun and said,
""Now, just shut up and keep your hands on the wheel...
CHORUS
And then the moon disappeared and it started to rain
So I turned the windshield wipers on full
And on the bag in her lap I saw the name of a big bank downtown
And I said, ""YOu don't have to worry about me...""
And when I turned the headlights on,
Just for a minute I thought I saw the both of us
On some kinda tropical island someplace
Walkin' down a white sandy beach eatin' something...
CHORUS
We pulled out of traffic down a dark side street
She was fixin' her hair in the mirror
I made a left turn at a yellow light
Drove my cab fast towards the pier
She boarded the boat and turned and blew me a kiss
and leter on when the squad cars came 'round
I ate a handful 'a peanuts and then I told 'em this

And then a man began to yell
About savin' souls to heaven
And for the sinner there was hell
Well later on that night
In a motel room down the road
He kept his meeting for a cat-o-nine beating
>From a leather-clad man named Moe
CHORUS

We're looking for the last honest man
An honest man
Keep searching for the last honest man
There's a man that moves the masses
On a big city radio dial
He shouts and screams at all he's seen
Runs a talk show like a trial
And there's a bartender keeping secrets
About a boxer that took a dive
And in an office way uptown a deal is going down
That could get somebody four to five
CHORUS
Now we'll keep looking high and low
And we'll keep searching 'round
Is everybody, everyone, dishonest in this town?
Well they'll stab you in the back
You get a handshake and a smile
But if one don't get ya, the other one will
And ya gotta walk that mile

Stan Ridgway,"I work for the newspapers
Any news is good news I always say
But I don't write no daily column
Talk  is cheap and so is my pay.

And when my work days over
I pocket five or ten from the tray
And then I start up again at five am
I stack 'em up just to throw 'em away.

Now lately I've been thinking	
What would the world do without the news 
You wouldn't know when wars were started
Or when they ended,  win or lose.

It probably be a better world to live in
But the question would be who's?
And what side your on or who's right or wrong 
You'd never have to choose.

Some times late at night 
I get to see the streets like no one else can
There's a lot of things going on here
That even newspapers don't  understand.

Some people got too much money
Some  rob  with a gun or a ballpoint pen
Maybe I'll get me a big black cape
And then they'll be running from me,
Looking over their shoulder for me.

Was on the front just yesterday

""Not long enough, 'cause we got here too late.""
CHORUS
""And everybody wants another piece of pie today,"" he said
""You gotta watch the ones who always keep their hands clean.""
It's the big heat
There's someone followin' you
It's the big heat
Step aside we're comin' through
Well we followed him from Tucson, ended up in Baton Rouge
We trailed him here with information by
A woman he knew in Barstow that would like to see him dead
That was four weeks ago...well maybe five
CHORUS
A block away he wondered if he'd left behind a clue
The front page of a paper dated 1992
He remembered when he used to be the chairman of the board
But that was when the world was young and long before the war

",The Big Heat
Stan Ridgway,"I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said ""Wait!""
When he came in close beside me he said ""Don't worry, son, I'm here""
""If Charlie wants to tangle now they'll have two to dodge""
I said ""Well, thanks a lot"", I told him my name and asked him his
And he said ""The boys just call me Camouflage""

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Well, I was gonna ask him where he came from
When we heard the bullets fly
Comin' through the brush and all around our ears
And then I saw that big marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange, but suddenly I forgot my fears

Well we fought all night and side by side, we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
And it was here the river bank when the ambush came on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big marine, he just swat it with his hands
Just like it was a fly!

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully strange marine

And I knew there was something weird about him
'Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swattin' those charlies with it from here to kingdom come

When he led me out of danger, I saw my camp and waved goodbye
But he just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage
When I said his name a soldier gulped and the medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said ""You may be tellin' true boy, but this here is Camouflage""
""And he's been right here since he passed away last night""
""In fact he's been here all week long""
""But before he went he said 'semper fi' and said his only wish""
""Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage""
""So here, take his dog tag son, I know, he'd want you to have it now""
And we both said a prayer for a big marine named Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully BIG marine

So, next time, you're in a jungle fight
And you feel a presence near
Or hear a voice that in your mind will lodge
Just be thankful that you're not alone
And you've got some company from a big marine
The boys call Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully BIG marine

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully BIG marine

Whoa Camouflage
Whoa Camouflage",Camouflage [Single Remix Edit][Edit]
Stan Ridgway,"I can feel the life runnin' out of me workin' here at Pete's
Two years ago it was just the thing
Workin' cars part time every week
I met 'em both at a drag race
They both dressed pretty snappy that day
Pete's wife Peg put the make on me
While Pete just looked the other way
Now no one can say what your future will hold
Or what your life will have in store
We went home that night
Pete passed out on the couch
And then Peg pulled me down on the floor
Well, I know she knew what she was doing
Forbidden fruit, but what the hell, I bit
That's all it took, my fate was sealed
That night the flame was lit
And every night when the lights go out
Pete drinks his booze and then he passes out
And I hear a footstep outside my door
And then I remember what I started working here for
CHORUS
Peg and Pete and me
One and one and one make three
Peg and Pete and me
One and one and one make three
Now tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Tonight Peg, we gotta stop this thing
I don't know if we can, Peg said
""Don't worry, now Pete's asleep and I've got a certain plan
You know everything is in my name,"" she said,
""and anyway I love you so very much.
He'll never feel a thing
Just like he never woke up
And after that it will be just us.""
Every night when the lights go out
Pete drinks his booze and then he passes out
And I hear a footstep outside my door
And then I remember what I started working here for
CHORUS
The next morning when I woke up Peg was gone
But the dtective said, ""Son, yo ugotta come downtown with me
'Cause we know you killed Pete dead.""
The jury found me guilty
And sent me up for ninety-nine to life
And if there's any advice I can give from this cell
NEver trust a rich, dead man's wife

Stan Ridgway,"As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tome Paine's
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains

I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm

Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
She said but I don't wish to
Said I but you've got no choice

I beg you sir, she pleaded
From the corner of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together we'll fly south

Just then Tom Paine himself
Came runnin' across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield

And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
I'm sorry sir, he said to me
I'm sorry for what she's done

Stan Ridgway,"Now, when the city was in flame, you were on the phone
Sellin' fire hoses at a premium loan
Yeah, the bankers all smile; but when you pass, they frown

Now, we seen you drivin' down the boulevard
You throw that trash, but not in your backyard
But like Newton and the apple, what goes up comes down
You're still a little too smart for a big dumb town

We'll all applaud when you break on through
""He's a genius, boys, but then we always knew...""

Yeah, lofty possibilities, you never had a doubt
We'd all scream from the bleachers when you'd always strike out
But now you're way out in front and you look glory bound
You're just a little too smart for a big dumb town

Now, when the world is over, clocks run outta wind
Somebody will scrape through the ruins and find
A little picture of you and in a file they found
Sayin' just a little too smart for a big dumb town

Now, you speak so soft but in your heart you're cold
In a tower of glass you've got a mountain of gold

Stan Ridgway,"Movin' kinda slow, no I never had much balance
Why does everyone I know keep makin' lots a' dough
I guess I'll find out soon when I get to that crystal palace in the sky

I've heard stories second hand about its grand interior
Its gold and silver strands, cathedral ceilings way up high
All the furnishing's unique when you get to your crystal palace in the sky

Well, I've worked as a part time circus boy
Collected cans down Saticoy
And patiently put forth my master plan

I've imagined futures and full plates
And slept with every subliminal tape
But now I'm so angry at someone
My contract is in breach
Why must my crystal palace be on hold this week?

I feel lucky I suppose, at least we're all still breathin'
Stuck here in escrow, just a' waitin' out our loan
But no big armed patrol will stop me when I get to my crystal palace by and by

And this one here makes all the bubbles go

Tonight you'll be joinin' my exclusive club

For you I'll even grow a pencil thin moustache
You can put me in chains... I'll wear that wolf mask
And you can starve me in your basement for a couple of weeks

I want to take you far away from this maddening crowd

Stayin' up all night and drivin' past the dawn
Me and two from Tennessee, up in lights on that marquee
From Folsom Prison to San Quentin, oh but now those days are gone

His guitar was dark and deep, he played in the lower range
Even now it sends a shiver up my spine
He played a twangin' metal string, and his tone was round and strange
He left too soon and no one's ever took his place inside my mind

Stan Ridgway,"It could have been a million years ago or maybe yesterday
I crawled out of this wilderness, a debt I had to pay
I must have tipped the scales somewhere way back
Never saw the seeds I'd sewn
So now I travel backwards looking for a man of stone

A foggy night, a neon light... I've seen him standing there
Movin' where the shadows creep no he never did play fair
And one night I almost got him, but I knew you'd tapped my phone
And communication is dangerous, lookin' for a man of stone

With Juan in Argentina I thought I saw him in the street
In a seaplane over Hydra he sat in the captain's seat
And I've chased him from the Colosseum down the Spanish steps in Rome
And history just gets hazy lookin' for a man of stone

In the mornin' out your I saw him leanin' on a tree
Wearin' a snappy suit of grey and then he motioned to me
He pointed with his finger, as if to say my soul he owned
But I had sold that long ago to you lookin' for a man of stone

Now I sit in this burnt out barn they call The Raven's Nest
Drinkin' bloody monkeys, your name tattooed on my chest

So I've kept this cage closed tightly when I feed her

You'll need someone just like me to hold the wolves at bay
I love you like a sculptor loves his chistle and his stone
How can you go with all the love I've shown

I've invested many precious hours of training
Your poise, your grace, your youthful face is fading
And without me you will falter, and confuse and soon go blind
I know what scares you there inside your mind

Now without you to advise I'm feeling weaker
This game's no fun to play without a teacher
And without my guide and councel you will surely die alone
I demand you back, look at the love I've shown

Now I've never been unfaithful 'til this moment
You've made me now investigate my life
My scars and stitches shown, I've been stripped now to the bone
Look what you've done with all the love I've shown

Now what word, maybe somewhere will finally trip you?
How cool of you to do this thing to me
And I know you'll always fail, I always did

I was drivin' outta town

Somewhere way off in Spain
Through a scratchy intercom it came

Maybe out in space, or inside a sound?
And is there a room that always
Has a swinging door?
Is there a place? I don't know anymore

I was dreaming 'bout you yesterday out on the pier
And I felt you close at hand, your presence in the sand

I could hear you whispering so softly in my ear

When a slip could get you killed
A man appeared with a master plan
And they called him Wild Bill

When he was done, yeah, you knew less
And he started up the company one
From what was left of the O.S.S. two

The secrets that he'd hold
Wild Bill, Wild Bill
He slept out in the cold

Now he was there in '45
When the good war had wound down
The enemy had all been caught
But some could not be found

The price of information
Sometimes takes a sacrifice
A secret traded for a life
But someone pays the price

[Chorus]

The world was on fire for Bill
He had to take control
The enemy was close at hand
The tanks were told to hold

But deep inside Bill's massive head
A master plan did bloom

By sellin' a brand new tune

Stan Ridgway,"I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down 
It was in the jungle wars of '65 
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone 
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside 
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun 
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate 
And then a big marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes 
Appeared there at my shoulder and said wait 

When he came in close beside me he said, 
""Don't worry, son, I'm here, 
If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge."" 
I said, ""Well thanks a lot."" 
I told him my name and asked him his 
And he said, ""The boys just call me Camouflage."" 

Whoa Camouflage 
Things are never quite the way they seem 
Whoa Camoufalge 
I was awfully glad to see this big marine 

Well I was gonna ask him where he came from 
When we heard the bullets fly 
Coming through the brush
And all around our ears

It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange but suddenly I forgot my fears

Well, we fought all night side by side we took our battle stance 
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man 
'Cause they seemed to go right through him 
As if he wasn't there 
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran 

And it was near the river bank when the ambush came on top of us 
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had 
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush 
And that big marine he just swatted it with his hand 
Just like it was a fly

Whoa Camouflage 
Things are never quite the way they seem 
Whoa Camouflage 
This was an awfully strange Marine

And I knew there was something weird about him 
'Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree 
Right up out of the ground 
And swattin' those Charlies with it from here to Kingdom Come 

When he led me out of danger 
I saw my camp and waved goodbye 
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone 
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night 
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage 

When I said his name a soldier gulped 
And a medic took my arm 
And led me to a green tent on the right 
He said, ""You may be tellin' the truth boy, 
But this here is Camouflage, 
And he's been right here since he passed away last night."" 
In fact, he's been here all week long

But before he went he said, ""Semper Fi,"" 
And said his only wish 
Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage 
So here, take his dog tag, son, 
I know he'd want you to have it now."" 
And we both said a prayer for a big marine named Camouflage 

Whoa Camouflage 
Things are never quite the way they seem 
Whoa Camouflage 
This was an awfully big marine

So next time you're in a jungle fight
And you feel the presence near
Or hear a voice that in your mind will lie
Just be thankful that you're not alone
And you got some company
From a big Marine the boys called Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage 
Things are never quite the way they seem 
Whoa Camouflage 
This was an awfully big Marine

Whoa Camouflage 
Things are never quite the way they seem 
Whoa Camouflage 
This was an awfully big Marine",Camouflage (Marlon Brando Version)

We'll all need to dry out
And the forecast will be
Sunny and fair
After the storm

We'll have a big parade
And the smell of victory will be in the air
We'll march in the sun
And listen to speeches
Life will be a bowl of cream and peaches

After the storm
We'll be sucking on swallows 
And driving our trucks in the sand
We'll redraw the maps
Wear snappy new caps
A gentle breeze will blow over the land

We'll pack up our things
Maybe get married
Throw off that weak, wussy
Feeling we carried
Bring it all home
In a bag to be buried

The flowers will grow
And pastures of plenty we'll see
We'll dig a few holes
Heat up a few coals
And have a big barbecue feed

We'll shine up our cars
Drive in the sun
Pitch a tent in the woods
And make a beer run

Rain is comin' down
Half a block away
You can hear that sound
Powered up by love
And electricity
Makin' lots of noise
And feelin' free

Got a brand new amp
A speaker with a tear
Shock ourselves on wires

Because I say it is
This one's about cleopatra
Or maybe nick or liz

You play the drums today
I'll play guitar
We're gonna be in a famous band
We're gonna go real far
So pass over that bottle o' wine
We'll smoke all the cigarettes
Is that a car in the driveway?
We have not finished yet

I heard an old man next door
I think we killed 'I'm with our sound
I saw the body in the ambulance
Maybe we should turn it down
So everybody back off one notch
And close that door on down

Stan Ridgway,"He got the high sign so he jumped a bus
Along the roads that wind on through
The hot mojave and the jericho
He'd start his whole life anew
And what he left behind he hadn't valued
Half as much as some things
He never knew

Right around sundown...
He got dropped off on a street in town
Where a grey old man looked him up and down and said
""son, this ain't no western movie matinee
You're a long way off from yippie-yi-yay
'cause I can tell at a glance you're not from 'round these parts
You've got a green look about'cha¨c¨cthat's a gringo for starts
Sometimes the only thing a western savage understands
Are whiskey and rifles and an unarmed man
Like you""


""so you gotta keep on the move!
Don't let that fancy paint job fool you!""
Then the old timer pulled him close and said


You've got a long way, I know
You've got a longer drive ahead
Through the bones of the buffalo
Through the claims of the western dead, and¨c¨c
Just like the spokes of a wheel
You'll spin 'round with the rest
You'll hear the drums and the brush of steel
You'll hear the call of the west, call of the west
You'll hear the call of the west, call of the west


Spoken
Harshly awakened by the sound of six rounds of light-caliber rifle fire
Followed minutes later by the booming of nine rounds from a heavier rifle
But you can't close off the wilderness
He heard the snick of a rifle bolt
And found himself peering down the muzzle
Of a weapon held by a drunken liquor store owner
""there's a conflict,"" he said, ""there's a conflict
Between land and people
The people have to go
They've come all the way out here to make mining claims
To do automobile body work
To gamble
Take pictures
To not have to do laundry
To own a mini-bike
Have their own cb radios and air conditioning
Good plumbing for sure
And to sell time/life books and to work in a deli
To have a little chili every morning
And maybe... maybe to own their own gas stations again
And take drugs
Have some crazy sex
But above all, above all, to have a fair shake
To get a piece of the rock and a slice of the pie
And spit out of the window of your car and not have the wind blow it back in your face""


Now, from the high timberline to the deserts dry
Who'll risk dangling on some hangman's tree
To stake their claims on these prarie plains
While they say this lunch is not had for free?
Just like the spokes of a wheel
Who'll spin 'round with the rest
They'll hear the drums and the brush of steel
And I'll hear the call of the west, call of the west
(yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay, yippie-yi-yo-ohh-ohh)
I'll hear the call of the west, call of the west

And it makes a fiery ring

Coaching these kids to the top, and calling them men.
I was a third round pick in the NHL
And that's three years of living in hell,
And going up flying, and going home dying.

My life was over the boards and playing the game,
And every day checking the papers and finding my name.
My dad would go crazy when the scouts would call;
He'd tell me that I'd have it all
Ninety nine of us trying, only one of us flying.

And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A,
Dreaming of that miracle play,
And going up flying, going home dying.

I tell them to think of the play and not of the fame.
If they've got any future at all, it's not in the game.
'Cause they'll be crippled and starting all over again
Selling on commissions and remembering
When they were flying, remembering dying.

'Bout the hills in spring, and the rivers that bend,
The rocky deep pass, and the poppies and ponies,
Running through the grass, up and down the road

White smoke in a wisp, from here to the door,
Their admission they paid, for the stories they're told,
Of a clear new day, hold me down on the road

And I'd sure like to call you 'cause I feel so alone.

Now, it's another cold city but the same old hotel room.
They all look the same to me after a while.
A bed and a window over some dirty alley,
Looking on to the streets meeting nobody's smile.

Now every telephone says, ""Hold the line"",
Like the preachers did when I was just a kid;
And it's strange how it still touches me after all this time.
They said, ""Keep your light shining brightly"".
And I just can't take it lightly; I'm still trying to find it.

Now, every evening brings another show,
To empty faces screaming over too much beer.
And what they find to talk about I guess I'll never, ever know.
But I'm leaving tomorrow and I don't regret it.
Just one more town and then I can forget â?¦

Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad

but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

Stan Sykes,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;

cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

Stan Werner,"Ah New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around, too much
Ah too many people, too much -- a ha hah
Too much, too many people, too much, rrrrrrrah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin DOWN on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin up the avenue
Doin what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm livin in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, ah too many people, too much
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump""
Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
but you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race

Too much, ah too many people, too much... a-ha hah
Too much, ah too many people, too much! Rrrrrrrah!

Stand at a skyscraper reachin into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares

Paranoid schitzo, set back, snowbound

No, you can't stop now

I can't wait for your invitation
Yeah, I want you to rock my nation

I don't care if you slept with millions
Or if you look like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby, the wild life

I don't care if you slept with zillions
Or if you sing like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby, the wild life

I'll make you understand
I'll make you understand

Stanfour,"Feels like we’re floating up a stream
Looking at a screen
It’s like we’re going nowhere
I need to see your face
Our photo album plays
Your eyes are like a maze that
Takes me down into cloudy deep blue skies
Deep blue skies

I don’t wanna wait until tonight
I’m lost without you
I don’t wanna stay up late tonight
Just thinking about you
Don’t replace

We might be face to face tonight

It feels like we’re talking to machines
Touching plastic things
A picture can’t replace a face that’s beautiful
A rainy day that shines lost in power lines
Connect the wires to our bodies, souls and minds

We stood together, you and I.
There was no place to go, no time to add.
So we brace ourselves for the impact.

Oh, when the waves crushing,
So cruel to your skin
And you're lost,
Shaking off the weight.
When the sea breaks through,
Try to swallow you.
You wake up, learn to breathe again.

We cried for every fading light (wooh, wooh)
All the good days flashed before our eyes (wooh, wooh)
It's so hard to leave something behind (wooh, wooh)
When your heart still wants to hold so tight.

Oh, when the waves crushing,
So cruel to your skin
And you're lost,
Shaking off the weight.
When it all breaks you,
And you hallow through.
You wake up, learn to breathe again.

Uhhhhh,
Uhhhhh.

Stanislas,"Où s'en vont tous ceux qu'on aime quand ils nous ont quittés 
Y a t'il une vaste plaine derrière l'immensité 
Au cœur d'une clairière 
Seraient ils rassemblés
Y a t'il au delà des mers
Une porte dérobée

Est-ce qu'ils redoivent encore toutes nos pensées?

Où s'en vont tous ceux qu'on aime quand ils nous ont quittés

Stanislas,"J'aimerais être une chanson, 
Pour tourner dans sa tête, 
Lire les pensées secrètes, 
Qui dorment sous son front.

Un petit air de rien
Entré par une oreille
Qui jusqu'au cœur se fraye
Le plus court des chemins.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour lever ses défenses,
Et qu'en toute innocence,
Elle m'invite dans son bain.

Mais je ne suis qu'un voisin,
Du temps que je dépense.
Je chanterai je pense
Même si ça ne sert à rien.

J'aimerais être une chanson,
De celles qui vous accrochent,
Petit ruban de scotch,
Collé à ses talons.

Une mélodie légère,
Qui partout l'accompagne,
La quitte puis la rejoigne,
Dans un même courant d'air.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour lever ses défenses,
Et qu'en toute innocence,
Elle m'invite dans son bain.

Mais je ne suis qu'un gredin,
Qui court après la chance,
Le cœur dans tous les sens,
Le piano à la main.

J'aimerais être une chanson
Pour traîner sur ces lèvres,
Et sur son rouge à lèvres,
Patiner en chausson

Une poésie mineure,
Qu'on fredonne sans fin
Sans savoir d'où elle vient
Ni le nom de l'auteur.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour vivre dans sa bouche,
Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

Mais je ne suis qu'un vaurien,
Un signe sur la garance,
Une cigale une absence,
Trois notes dans un coin.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour vivre dans sa bouche,
Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Stanley Black,"Serenade in the night 'neath a fair lady's window
Just the same serenade that I tenderly played on a night long ago
There were stars in the sky and I sang 'neath the roses
But she gave not a sign that she'd ever be mine and my love story closes

Oh! why must my heart keep on singing it?

Stanley Black,"Is this the little girl I carried?
Is this the little boy at play?
I don't remember growing older,
When did they?
When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall?
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?

Swiftly flow the days.
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset,
Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,
Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.
Is there a canopy in store for me?

And fading in the Arabian sun
You're stallion stands to watch the sun set
The women scream as the camels run
To find a mirage cool oasis
And lie beneath the palms and the sky
And spend the night a silver moon set
The rising sun in the eagles eye

Burnin' with desert fire, Cooling the man
Endless is the blowing desert
And in the shipwreck some may be lost
Too hot the sand too deep the oceans

To let them know the way he felt inside
He could not stand to hide it

Oh, my mother

Are you still proud of your little boy?

By the people that he cared for
It's not what they expected
But he could not keep it secret anymore

There's a new world
You can make it on your own

Are you still proud of your little boy?

Stanley Holloway,"There's a famous seaside place called Blackpool
That's noted for fresh air and fun
And Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom
Went there with young Albert, their son
A fine little lad were young Albert
All dressed in his best, quite a swell
He'd a stick with an 'orse's 'ead 'andle;
The finest that Woolworth's could sell
They didn't think much to the ocean
The waves they were piddlin' and small
There were no wrecks and nobody drownded
'Fact, nothin' to laugh at at all!
So, seeking for further amusement
They paid, and went into the zoo
Where they'd lions and tigers and camels
And cold ale and sandwiches, too
There were one great big lion called Wallace
Whose nose was all covered with scars;
He lay in a som-no-lent posture
With the side of 'is face on the bars
Now Albert 'ad 'eard about lions-
'Ow they was ferocious and wild;
To see lion lyin' so peaceful
Just didn't seem right to the child
So straightway the brave little feller
Not showin' a morsel of fear
Took 'is stick with the 'orse's 'ead 'andle
And stuck it in Wallace's ear
You could see that the lion din't like it
For givin' a kind of a roll
'E pulled Albert inside the cage with 'im
And swallered the little lad - 'ole!
Now Mother 'ad seen this occurrence
And not knowin' what to do next
She 'ollered ""Yon lion's et Albert!""
An' Father said ""Ee, I am vexed.""
They complained to an animal keeper
Who said ""My, wot a nasty mis'ap;
Are you sure it's your boy 'e's eaten?""
Pa said, ""Am I sure? There's 'is cap!""
The manager 'ad to be sent for;
'E came and 'e said ""Wot's to-do?""
Ma said ""Yon lion's et Albert
And 'im in 'is Sunday clothes, too!""
Father said ""Right's right, young feller-
I think it's a shame and a sin
To 'ave our son et by a lion
And after we paid to come in.""
The manager wanted no trouble;
He took out his purse right away
Sayin' ""'Ow much to settle the matter?""
Pa said ""Wot do you usually pay?""
But Mother 'ad turned a bit awkward
When she saw where 'er Albert 'ad gone
She said ""No, someone's got to be summonsed!""
So that was decided upon
And off they all went to p'lice station
In front of a Magistrate chap;
They told what 'ad 'appened to Albert
And proved it by showing 'is cap
The Magistrate gave 'is opinion
That no one was really to blame
And 'e said that 'e 'oped the Ramsbottoms
Would 'ave further sons to their name
At that Mother got proper blazin':
""And thank you, sir, kindly,"" said she-
""Wot, spend all our lives raisin' children
To feed ruddy lions? Not me!""",The Lion and Albert

Stanley Turrentine,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low

Stanley Turrentine,"Sunny, ce matin encore c'était l'hiver
Sunny, depuis que tu es là le ciel est plus clair
Il y a du soleil dans les rues sur les toits
Le printemps est revenu avec toi
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, c'est déjà la fin de ma longue nuit
Sunny, à nouveau pour moi le soleil luit
J'ai eu des mauvais jours dans le vent et la pluie
J'avais si peur que tu m'oublies
Mais tu m'aimes toujours, mon amour

Sunny, tu m'as ramené tant de soleil
Sunny, le ciel est si bleu quand je m'éveille
Je me vois déjà aux vacances d'été
Les beaux jours durent toute l'année
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, merci pour toutes les choses que je te dois
Sunny, pour tout le bonheur d'être avec toi
Oh merci pour le regard que tu poses sur moi
Et pour les images que j'y vois
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Stanley Turrentine,"Move over, sun, and give me some sky
I got me some wings I'm eager to try
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown

On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name
You're gonna hear from me

Fortune, smile on the road before me
I am fortune's child

Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover

Stanley Turrentine,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

Funny, that rainy day is here

Stanley Turrentine,"Now my room has got two windows but the sunshine never comes through,
You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with
you!
CHORUS:
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".
Well, I feel so sad and blue
and it's all because of you.
I could cry, I could cry, i could cry,
I could die, I could die, I could die,
because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.

stone,
Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,
I'm not used to being alone!

If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway

Stanley Turrentine,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Stanley Turrentine,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Stanley Turrentine,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Stanley Turrentine,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Stanley Turrentine,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

Stanley Turrentine,"And I wake up in the mornin' 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples
