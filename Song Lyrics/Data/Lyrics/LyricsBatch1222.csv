The Gaslight Anthem,"So the ambulances came
They took your pulse and packed up your things
And the papers read
Some boys forget what the heartache brings

And the pounding in the street
Was your heart in four-four time
And the taste of defeat
Was never too far from your mind

And Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
I always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis
And in my head there's all these classic cars and outlaw cowboy bands
I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else

So gravity came
And stole the temple that the schoolboys praised
And the crowd shuffled in
You're getting drinks for the same boys who once bought you everything

And the powder on the bar was just this one time
The patter on the bar was just this one night
And only to get by

And Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
I always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis
And in my head there's all these classic cars and outlaw cowboy bands
I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else

There was ""Southern Accents"" on the radio as I drove home
And at night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
It's a pretty good song, baby you know the rest
Baby, you know the rest

And Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
Always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis
And in my head there's all these classic cars and outlaw cowboy bands
I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else

When our boots they hit the ground
They made a high and lonesome sound
When our boots they hit the ground
They made a high and lonesome sound
When our boots they hit the ground
They made a high and lonesome sound

When our boots they hit the ground
Down from the clouds
They made a high and lonesome sound",High Lonesome
The Gaslight Anthem,"See, I've been here for 28 years
Poundin' sweat beneath these wheels
We tattooed lines beneath our skin
No surrender, my Bobby Jean

See, I've been here for 28 years
Poundin' sweat beneath these wheels
We tattooed lines beneath our skin
No surrender, my Bobby Jean

And we've been burned by all our fears
Just from growin' up around here
Our father's factories marked our cards
While Eden burned against the stars

And Sally said, Sally said
""I can't take no more regret""
It cut us deep into our souls
Came and climbed into our bed

And Sally said, Sally said
""Meet me by the river's edge""
We're going to wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again

You know I had these ballroom dreams
That, as a child came to me
I was a boy in Grandma's arms
A mother's pride and a wounded heart

And I was full with fiery wonder
You wore Audrey Hepburn pearls
You were the only one who understood me then
You're the only one who will

And Sally said, Sally said
""I can't take no more regret""
It cut us deep into our souls
Came and climbed into our bed

And Sally said, Sally said
""Meet me by the river's edge""
We're going to wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again

And now I drive the one-oh-one
On a California night
And I'm amazed at all the stars
Beneath that old Hollywood sign

And they waltz the ballet up the boulevard 
To a place we never kept
And I'm not sure if we belong here
If I never really left or if I can go home

And Sally said, Sally said
""I can't take no more regret""
It cut us deep into our souls
Came and climbed into our bed

And Sally said, Sally said
""Meet me by the river's edge""
We're going to wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again

No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
Meet me by the river's edge

No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
Meet me by the river's edge",Meet Me by the River's Edge
The Gaslight Anthem,"Like Miles Davis, I've been swayed by the cool
There's just something 'bout the summertime, there's just something 'bout the moon
So I laid a kiss on a stone, tossed it upside your window by the roof
Before you change your mind, Miles, bring in the cool

Honey, put on your red dress and your diamond-soled shoes
Climb on out from that window, climb on out of your room
'Cause I never had a good thing and I always had the blues
But I heard that you always kinda wondered, Miles, strike up the cool

Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long

Like poor Mr. Pitiful, I can't turn you loose
You move like a dream I had, I woke up sweating in my room
But your mama's got plans and your daddy's aim is true
She never understood that it ain't no good, papa never heard the cool

So now I've got up my nerve and found me a stone
With a flick of the wrist and a turn of the key, you'll just fall in my arms

And don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long

So why don't you sing to me on this long drive home
And let the sound of your voice sway sweet and slow
As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground

We might always be blue
Jackson

Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on

No, don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on

As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down",Miles Davis & The Cool
The Gaslight Anthem,"If I could write,
I'd tell you how much I've missed these nights
Where we'd dig around the bones
And try to find peace and patches for the holes

I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
The corner boys told her how I was dyin' to meet her
Like a prayer I said on a dead man's knee
You drove up like a parade

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos,
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos,
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart straight in my arms

Fell straight in my arms

And I miss it sometimes
Shakin' like a leaf on the corner of Vine
But I heard it's alright
The radio spoke to a good friend of mine

And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart right in my arms
Right in my arms

And I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens
And tryin' to find some way to be redeemed
Bring a dollar with you, baby
In the cold, cold ground

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above, these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart, you fell straight in my arms.

You fell straight in my arms.",Old White Lincoln
The Gaslight Anthem,"Not tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
I can't feel a single thing but the weight of the wires

Crackin' electric light
Remember baby, we were a stone
And we would sleep where we're fallin'

We would fight about it (fight about it)
We'd fight about it (fight about it)
Then we laughed about it (laughed about it)
And we'd ride on, ride on
Ferris wheel lights on

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

Not tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
If we don't come through, they're gonna bury us alive

In this great abyss
Of just what might have been
Where we can take a seat at the bar with the other broken heroes

Where they talk about it (talk about it)
Just talk about it (talk about it)
And do nothin' 'bout it (nothin' 'bout it)
Right on, right on
Ferris wheel lights on

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what Wagin' Matty said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mama always said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

The Gaslight Anthem,"Look what you started,
I seem to be coming out of my skin
Look what you've forgotten here
The bandages just don't keep me in

And when it was over, I woke up alone

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang

Look at the damage,
The fortunes came for the richer men.
While we're left with gallows,
Waiting for us liars to come down and hang.

And when it was over, I woke up alone

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang

And here's where we died that time last year,
And here's where the angels and devils meet.
And you can dance with the queen if you need,
And she will always keep your cards
Close to her heart ooh
So close to her heart before they tear you apart

When they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
And I called for my father but my father had died
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang
You told me fortunes, in American Slang",American Slang
The Gaslight Anthem,"Got your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke
Just in case you need it
I know you got your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke
Just in case you needed
Some of her to spin around
Rougher than the last one
Oh, what'd you used to say
The harder they come
But he just swears he's praying for a good time
He, he said he just doesn't miss her
And I have heard you never really lose it
Do you, do you

He took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
He found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
And now you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby

And you tied two knuckles up
How they grind down
Tried to be a man
Tough just like your father
Try to settle down
Boy, I could calm down
Remember them songs
And the reasons we were singing
But he said he just doesn't miss her
He, he said it's somewhere in his framework
And I have heard you never really lose it
Do you, do you

He took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
He found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were reasons that were driving you crazy
Until you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby

And you can wait all night long
Until it all goes wrong
And you waste away your soul
And you can wait, wait, wait, wait

You took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
You found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
Until you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby",Boxer
The Gaslight Anthem,"My queen of the Bronx
Blue eyes and spitfire
I saw you walking back and forth about another boy
Thinking that you may want to leave

So give me the fevers that just won't break
And give me the children you don't want to raise
And tell me about the Cool, he sings to you in those songs
If it's better than my love, then bring it on

And take it back out to the streets where you know you used to be
For the Romeos uptown, if I bring you down
And you're tired of those vows
And you're really walking out

So give me the fevers that just won't break
And give me the children you don't want to raise
And tell me about the Cool, he sings to you in those songs
If it's better than my love, baby, bring it on
Oh, bring it on

Stop clicking your red heels and wishing for home
I'm hearing that he tells you he can read your palms
Is he better than my love? (better than my love?)
Is he better than my love? (better than my love?)

So I found the letters with the reasons to things
You've been feeling that he says they'll never know
And you say the night just got too cold

Well, everybody's cold
Who's gonna keep my baby warm
When everybody goes?

So give me the fevers that just won't break
And give me the children you don't want to raise
And tell me about the Cool, he sings to you in those songs
If it's better than my love

Well, then wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wasn't I good to you?)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wasn't I good to you?)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(You don't know what's good for you)

So give me the fevers that just won't break
And give me the children you don't want to raise
And tell me about the Cool, he sings to you in those songs
You've been my baby for so long, come on, bring it on
Oh, bring it on

Stop clicking your red heels and wishing for home
I'm hearing that he tells you he can read your palms

If he's better than my love, then go on, take it all",Bring It On
The Gaslight Anthem,"Now the lights go low on the avenue
And the cars pass by in the rain
University boys and the girls fill the bars
While I'm just waiting for the light to change
And the steam heat pours from the bodies on the floor
In the basement where the Jackknives play
For the hub city girls in the ribbons and the curls
Who know the meaning of staying out late
The know the meaning of staying out very, very late

Who does it better than we do
Them sopranos in Andy Diamond's choir
Whoa, nobody knows
I've been crazy for so long without you

They'll find me beat down out in the universe
Though I'll never forget where I'm from
I might have moved away from home
And slept out there on my own
A million miles away in the stone
But the beat never leaves
And the temple's a relief
To my aching bones, rambling all over
And if I'm gone for too long
I can always hum along
So don't never forget what I told you
So don't never forget what I told you
Everybody singing

Who does it better than we do
Them sopranos in Andy Diamond's choir
Whoa, nobody knows
I've been crazy for so long without you

Just, baby who sings the rhythm and the blues
So sad, so slow, so smooth
Like I do, like I do
And oh, ain't it just like you want to
And oh, ain't it just like you always wanted to
Every night waiting
So long without you

Baby, who sings it better than we do
Them sopranos in Andy Diamond's choir

The Gaslight Anthem,"A cherry bomb, you are a mystery
Exploded, sparkling quiet nights
My teenage heart packed all my misery, baby
To fingertips that might ignite
And all along you knew my story, didn't you
And all night long I carried yours
Your blood was mixed wine and robbery, baby
And left us always wanting more

So don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
And God help the man who says
If you'd have known me when
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts

Cherry bomb, your love is surgery
Removing what you don't regard
And every breath felt like a funeral, baby
While you were packing up your car
And with the window down
I hear your tired mouth
You borrowed everything
And wore all your old welcomes out
And shame on you, my love
You sold your youth away
Memories are sinking ships
That never would be saved

So don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
And God help the man who says
If you'd have known me when
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts

And shame, shame, shame, shame on you
You kept your mind and heart and youth
Just like a tomb
And shame, shame, shame, shame on you
You kept your mind and heart and youth
Just like a tomb

And don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
So God help the man who says
If you'd have known me when
Old haunts are for all those ghosts
And don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
And God help the man who says
If you'd have known me when

If you'd have known me when

The Gaslight Anthem,"Goodbye circus wheel
May you rest along the sea 
I have given you the fire of my youth 
And the triumph o're my enemies
Goodbye fair weather home, and your faithless factories
I have given you the blood and the truth
From the wounds they laid onto me
And whatever they left, well, I kept it for my own heart

And the lonesome all understand
With the choirs in my head
And we were orphans before
We were ever the sons of regret

And on and on and on
The alphabet boys carry on
We were orphans before
We were ever the sons of these songs

And now my lights, they never go down
They waltz the moon and stars for me now
So you can find some local libertine
To take your daughters out on the town
And I can feel it in my aging bones
How the sound of the rain mixes up
Into the fountains where I drank my hero's blood
So I left you to find my very own hat full of rain

And the lonesome all understand
With the choirs in my head
And we were orphans before
We were ever the sons of regret

And on and on and on
The alphabet boys carry on
We were orphans before
We were ever the sons of these songs

Now I'm trying to keep it straight
Learning all the streets and the alleyways
And learning where they lead
Now that I'm left alone here to drive
But it's so hard to stand on your own
Against mirror of glass, hard and cold
But the clothes I wore
Just don't fit my soul anymore
No the clothes I wore
Just don't fit my soul anymore

And the lonesome all understand
With the choirs in my head
And we were orphans before
We were ever the sons of regret

The alphabet boys carry on
We were orphans before
We were ever the sons of these songs

It takes so long to find the words and the beat
And Charlie's waiting on the end of the phone
To hear you call on him to try to recapture
But them old records won't be saving your soul
And them feelings got the reasons you know
That you've forgotten somewhere

And you never got an invitation

For some moment that might never arrive at all
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore

But you're never gonna find it

And all my friends say

Hey hey, turn the record over
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay at her feet

But have you seen my heart
Have you seen how it bleeds
And the nights are so long, baby
Out here in the deep
The tick, ticking of hours, lonely
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms

The Gaslight Anthem,"What makes a man do the things that a man does
To be the very thing he perceives would capture your heart?

What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive, and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire

What makes a woman believe in a man such as me?
Unworthy to sit at your foot or your crown
I can only let you down, I can only let you down

What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin

Chasing the accolades of pride

And to ease the loss of youth
And how many years I've missed you
Pages plead forgiveness
Every word handwritten

Let it out, let me in, take a hold of my hand
There's nothing like another soul that's been cut up the same
And did you want to drive without a word in between?
I can understand, you need a minute to breathe
And to sew up the seams after all this defeat

And all my life I never had a chance

But I waited for you, gave you time to decide
But you never saw it from anybody else's side

Does anything still move you since you're educated now?
And all grown up and traveled so well
Do you still hear the sound of the thunder while you lie up by yourself?

Like you waited on his call and made your plans for great escapes
And there used to be a movement in the way your dress would wave
From your hips on down like electric through the ground

Now do you blow it out come Friday night?
See if you wanna, you can find me on the hood under the moonlight
Radio, oh radio, do you believe there’s still some magic left
Somewhere inside our souls?

Like I waited on your call and made my plans to share my name
And I love the country movement in the way your dress would wave
From your hips on down like electric through the ground

In this city by the sea that has always haunted me
And belonged to me somehow

And I'm not looking for your love
I'm only sniffing out blood
Just a little taste of where I came from

Is where I put you down to lay
So I can live with it
And in my heart, heart, heart there are these waters
Where I put you down to lay
While I learn to live with it
Until I'm free

And it's been all my life
I've been wondering on the inside
What we could've had
If you'd had a part in my life

And there were children involved
And they were brothers to me
Even if we never got to meet

And at the bottom of this river
Is where I put you down to lay
So I can live with it
And in my heart, heart, heart there are these waters
Where I put you down to lay
While I learn to live with it

Surely you wonder sometimes
And I'm sure you all sympathize

Would you come for a drive?
You can lean into me
If you ain't been in love for a while

I was born beside a river
That flows to a raging sea
That will one day serve to quell
Or one day be the death of me

In my faded jeans and far away eyes
And salty carnival kiss
That all my former lovers say
Was once magnificent

The Gaslight Anthem,"Did you sleep last night and do you remember dreams?
Do I ever cross your mind and do you ever think of me?
When you think about your life are there things you would reverse?
I still remember holding you, just out of sight of her
In the deep, dark parking lot pressed up against my car
With your hands around my neck I felt the pounding of your heart
And the summer night was giving in to the lure of Autumn’s sway
I can’t seem to forget that night or how I heard you say

That I’d just die if you ever took your love away
Oh and I'd just die if you ever took your love away
Would you miss me if I was gone and all the simple things were lost?
Would you ever wait on me to say
Oh that I’d just die if you ever took your love away

And I can still recall the hour when you first let down your walls
I thought I might've died right there floating up above it all
But it scared you love, to need someone, so you killed it all instead
But in the mist up on Mulholland, I could've sworn I heard you say

That I’d just die if you ever took your love away
Oh and I would just die if you ever took your love away
Did you miss me when I was gone and the simple things we lost?
I was aching to hear you say
Oh that I’d just die if you ever took your love away

That I’d just die if you ever took your love away
Yes and I would just die if you ever took your love away
Did you miss me when I was gone and the simple things we lost?
I was aching to hear you say
Oh that I’d just die if you ever took your love away

And did you miss me when I'm gone?
And the simple things we used to rely on?

Who came to bring back your dignity baby?

The Gaslight Anthem,"Well, the moon I know, in the town I live, is steady as she waits.
It seems as though she yearns for me and calls me by my name.
Sometimes she says come to me, kiss me while it's late.
And other nights she's just hanging with the stars.

And I've seen her waiting from all her mistakes
And what if he never comes when you call?

And, ""Hey, hey it's alright,"" she says,
""Once upon a time I lived a perfect night.
Hey, hey in another life,"" she says,
""In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago.""

""Don't look back,"" I heard a voice, in velvet I couldn't see.
The pictures then were black and white, and the details were in between.
I heard about a woman once, who did everything ever asked of her.
She died last week and her last words were, ""It wasn't worth it.""

And I've seen her patience through all her mistakes

The Gathering,"The cruelty of this world persists
The cold wind speaks for our lost
Whispering words, weaving worlds
Her time has come, alas

A man with opened eyes
One stopped out of a dream
With a view held within his mind
The tears for his bride redeem

Watching this world falling apart
Like the dreams in a shallow sleep
Countless are the nights they shared
The mourning in his tears

But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers, all are gone

Close the eyes of eternal love
Buries his face in his hands
Her face looks so alive
In the morning sun

But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers, all are gone

Illusions for one to see

I find my faith deserting me...

Dispossessed children in search of Paradise. 
A sign of unresolve that, 
Envisioned, drives the pinwheel on-and-on.

The innocence, consumed in dying rage!

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you

I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

when we would dream and scheme and while the time away,
I have a dream, so did you.

Two kids who followed all the rules, yester-fools, 
and now, now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
 
Where did it go, that yester-glow
When we could feel the wheel of life turn our way.
Yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
When I recall what we had,
I feel lost, I feel sad.
With nothing but the mem'ry of yester-love
and now now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna 
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mí

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!

Take back your singing in the rain

Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

The Gents,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

That I
Would love to love you

Will cry

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

The Geoff Love Singers,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Well she remembers taking money after gathering crops
And buying johnny's guitar at the brokers shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad site
He wouldn't get in trouble she was satisfied
Well she never knew there would come a day like this
When she'd have to give johnny a good bye kiss

I said bye, bye, bye, bye
I said bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye johnny, goodbye johnny be goode

Well now she finally got the letter she'd been dreaming of
When johnny wrote and told her he had done fell in love
As soon as he was married he'd bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad track
And every time you heard that locomotive roar
She'd be standing there waiting at the kitchen door

The Georgia Satellites,"Well I was out the other evening on a walk 
When I decided to take myself 
A little stroll through the park
I was young and I was feeling no pain

Well I was a happy man not a care in this world
A real up and comer with an eye for the girls
When I saw something that just about 
Set my young heart a flame

Well I introduced myself and I said 
Nice night for a walk
But I couldn't understand a thing she said 
When she talked
And I said honey, let's get something straight Between you and me

On the park bench
Her skirt rolled and I could 
See she was French

Trying on your diamond ring
Had to run in jump through the front door
Grab your hand and start to sing about

Anything to make my daddy proud.

Set fire to all our best laid plans.

Run out of gas while we're in the sky.

Working strange mischief on her bride to be.
It seems the pretty girl was laughing as her world was filled with doubt,
She laughed as her own head was chopped off and the fish came spilling out.
Watching the fish swim into the sea through a river of red, she said,
I've been wondering what's been troubling my head.
And I thank you for expelling those irritating pests,
Now if you'd slap me back together I'll be at my very best,
And we can go you devil, we can go.
Should've set the clocks back.
Should've taken her time.
Should've set her hair on fire with vodka and lime,
But it's too late ha ha...
It doesn't matter anyway,
Cuz when the light goes out heads are gonna roll. 
Now the story takes a happier turn,
Cuz the devil loved the girl and the feeling was returned.
They cut through the trees knocking the tops off as they flew,
To a pretty place for kissing, a place with a view.
They watched a man lay down his hand in a game of chance,
The lust for luck and security is a hopeless romance.
The devil grinned and whispered, comfort is a myth...
The clock is ticking ticking, goin' tick tick tick tick. 
Should've took the train.
Should've wore black.
Should've rode his high horse over a red apple jack,

She worked like a doctor,
Very determined,
Not afraid of getting pricked
By some lame spike,
Never wondering why. 
Well she left him in the dust
And got even more fucked up
And she did it all by herself.
But even when she got her ass
Off of the streets
He would visit her in her dreams. 
The last time she saw her darlin'
Was at the funeral parlour,
He was fresh off of the prison shelf.
Yeah he died with a needle in his eye,
But she was clean clean clean.
Yeah, she was clean clean clean. 
And he heard it through the walls
He heard it through the walls

Once there was a girlie,

Yes I am just a tart, a heart on stilts.
Pick the flower and it will wilt, to die in bliss, for greedy lover's kiss.

Want came to need. 
Burn these fields of corn, that surround. 
My harvest gone at the price of maturity. 
But these remains I've left to rot will be resurrected again and again 
by the next generation of children who want to change minds 
with the stain on hand. 
But, it's deeper than this, I'm not the only one who sees, it lies in diversity; 
acceptance to a degree, only to a degree. 
The fire that once occupied my eyes has spread to destroy this world 
I have grown. You have nothing new to scream beyond your fields 
and not a second of patience to learn from me the same. 
This time I harvest the crops of my past. 
As far as the demigods are concerned, I've sold myself out just the same.
I've burned bridges to feign brothers.
Brothers of nothing more than a simple label. 
So now, I'm in control after all, for myself I prove I still am.

What can waiting do?

Date: Fall 1989 
Daydream of a valentine
I couldn't wait to be added alone
jump forward to twelve years time
those dreams and a sad decline
I'd just thought leaving
Would leave it alone

[Chorus]
This isn't what i wished for
This isn't what i knew
What can waiting do?

What did we prove? 
Didn't we make this all come true?
(I just keep hanging on for more)
Didn't we choose? 
(I just keep on waiting at the door)

How did we lose? 
Where did we let the reigns go loose?
(I just keep hanging on for more)
Didn't we choose? 
(I just keep on waiting at the door)

How did we lose? 
Didn't we let the reigns go loose?

What if we knew?

The Getaway People,"Madeleine was a pretty little girl, why she didn't even hit sixteen
All the boys in the neighbourhood took advantage of the little girl's dream
Now they may try to hide it, but you just can't justify it
They used her up and crushed her seeds of a flower that was never meant to be
She needed love, they gave her lies
The promise of a paradise

Now there's nothing left for Madeleine to sanctify
Stuck in the middle, can't solve the riddle on the outside
Rockin' the cradle sure could be fatal on the outside

Such a shame, why she didn't last long, now who takes the blame for that
All the noise in the neighbourhood, they say that Madeleine's getting fat
They may try to fight it, but you just can't justify it
They used her up and crushed her seeds of a flower that was never meant to be
She gave the love she had, but then nobody gave it back again

They came with no shame, they came with seedy bar room seduction, they seep
But who weeps for Madeleine but for her own mother
Mother Earth gave birth to mankind, mankind gave nothing in return
Madeleine was a virgin clad, knew no better, Madeleine's been had
Easy target, easy game, nobody's here to take the blame
Nevertheless, hormones run wild, she needed love, they gave her lies

He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind,
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said,
""Boy let me tell you what:
I guess you didn´t know it, but I'm a fiddle player too,
And if you'd care to take a dare,
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle,
Boy, but give the Devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret,
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard,
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in,
And it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished, Johnny said,
""Well you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!""

And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny´s feet

I done told you once, you son of a bitch,

The Ghost Doctors,"If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home

Walk down the road on any path we choose
But then something changed, now days just aren’t the same
I’m feeling so empty like part of me has been removed

It got left out in the bitter cold
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong
Where did I go wrong?

Let me stop to ask the question
Will I ever get the chance to repeat?
I feel this more and more everyday
Take me back to when I used to believe

Nothing could prepare you, but we try our best
Failure upon failure, what happens next?
Nothing’s ever easy and life still goes on
Don’t stop push on before you become withdrawn
I’ve become withdrawn

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong
Where did I go wrong?

My innocence is gone
Where did I go wrong?
I feel it slipping away from me
Do you remember when we were free?

I’ve stood up on that ledge, and I know what you see
You’re looking over the edge and wanting to leap
I’ve written every word and expressed all my concerns
You’re losing that part of yourself, but it wasn’t meant to be

Has the damage already been done?

The Gits,"There are these people that use you for
Their own need for deception
By the size of their lies and
The size of the stories that they're telling
They've proved themselves to be
Very small.....minded
Do you ever think when you're dealing with the worst
The outcome is the best thing for you
And by the good of evil is the knowledge
That you face it
I could put it in some theme of a tale
Or a story from a myth
But it means a simple thing
I ain't worth nothing if there's no perspective
Of truth in my life
I think I've had enough
I wonder why I don't just go off
Don't like to be a violent woman
But I know I have it in me.
I know I shouldn't be surprised
Why some people look like hogs rolling in the mud
It's a dying shame
That's where some look for the truth!

The Gits,"You walk in with another headache
I can tell by the lines in your face
You seem to think if you just remove the problem
The answers are what will come next
Another shot of whiskey and maybe I'll be ready
For what's still crowded in your head
Never seeing that all the good times
Are what walked in with the bad
I don't know why we compromise ourselves
I thought it was a common understanding
Which all I've tried to help with
Tell me, do I end up empty handed?
Another couple of beers while I'm safe here at the bar
And maybe I'll get me some rest
Don't know why all the good times have to
Turn-up with the bad It's like a sword of hate
You brandish it so proud
I wonder if you're taught what you feel
Or is it the way you got it cold dead in your eye?
It would be good if you could just leave me
Well enough alone
The crime of fate is what I have to follow
Through if I'm going to get past you
Another shot of whiskey and that's about the
Only way I can listen anymore
Go ahead and drown me of everything
At least I still got my place at the bar

Some fool came up to me and said
""you'd make a star with that band,""
I said, ""it's not why we're doing this,
Why can't you fucking get it?""
'Cause all I've got to do is release through
These obstacles I've got to beat
Release from the man who manipulates me
By the breaking of my back,
With nothing left worth saving
All I gotta do is release through the
Obstacles I've yet to beat
Take us to a sturdy ship
Where we raise our glasses
No pints too dodgy here
We don't need our problems here
Away from all these people,
They're posing about, waiting for the next scheme
To tip them off and leave them drowning
In what they think is real
All that's ever been and all that's been said
It's not to my regret, you gotta
Face the edge of yourself
And they say if you got humor through it all
You'll find the will to survive what seems like hell
Take me to the water, launch me out to bloody sea
'Cause all you gotta do is release
Through these obstacles you've got to beat
Take us to the water
Launch us out to sea
And may the drunken mad ones follow me

The Gits,"When I'm going into the bar,
I'm there trying to ignore
This terror in me, I can't set it free
I can't make any sense
Unless it's in a song
And every time I try to feel
I only seem to wake up lifeless
Where would it ever end
When we fall to our own demand
It takes up your life
And throws it like dice
Each time we fail,
It never gets over looked
When you're thinking that the cards lay forward
It takes up your answers
With no second chances
Immobilized by the torment
It hits so hard, there's nothing more I can take
Needing each breath just to make it through
There's nothing more I'm expected to do
There's nothing worse than hating yourself
And parading around like you're somebody else
I wish that it would just all go to hell
Wanting some time just to be by myself

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Glove,"Here comes the book
The book of rules
If you play this game
You won't stay the same
You could win your golden teeth
Be a spinning top
Use a riding crop

Mr. Alphabet says
""Smile like a weasel as I cover you
Cover you in treacle""

We all know impatience is a sin
So do as you're told to do
It's so rewarding to
And you could win the Tin Man's heart
Be a chiming clock
Lie on the chopping block

Cover you in honey""

The Glove,"A disease is under my fingernails
It stains me like a tattoo

Back on the rack
Aching with time
Your face is familiar
From another crime

And we could swim, we could swim
My little fishes and me

Overgrown senses prickle and spark
The flesh is in the palm of my hand

Back on the rack
Love under will
Your face is familiar
From another kill

A tongue explodes into mouth
A taste of coma and tears

Back on the rack
My shape of rage
Your face is familiar
From another cage

And we could swim...",Orgy
The Glove,"Move inside my daydream
Like fingers in a glove
Twisting round and round and round
Round and round and round with love!

The meeker sleeker circle girls dressed in docile white
Spinning on a hill they follow the dracula kite
The first idea flew thin and uninvited from the sky
I reached out my hands and held the knife of ice

Very thin red water flowed underneath my skin
I turned their eyes blue children
The perfect murder
Wait until the darkest coldest summer nights

That's when it starts
But if you blink you'll miss the fun
You'll lose their pretty hearts

Pretty hearts",Perfect Murder
The Glove,"Your morning smile of torture holds me in it's grip
You trace the taste of yesterday the bruise upon my lip
You touch my eyes and hypnotize and slip inside my heart
I wait for this forever but we always fall apart

You want to hold me closer and secretly entice
You take the size of shadowed men
And punish me with kisses every night

This espionage is sweeter now now that we're alone 
But I meet your eyes and then dispise all we call our own
I write my name in lipstick on the mirror as I leave
To stay would be too dangerous
To break the make believe.",Punish Me With Kisses
The Glove,"Run around the chairs in your sunday dress
It's the best thing money can buy
Or leave me on the stairs with my feet in the air
I think that I'm jazzy like christ

One more cigarette and the car burns
Burning like the body waiting at home
Throw out your teeth and call all your friends
Someone coughing took away my breath
Inches of glass all shiny and new 
Screaming laughing - fucks me to death 

One more boy full of writhing white mice
Rolls over again in a london disguise
The blood bath woman in room number one
Sex-eye-make-up tonight
She just woke up today to do as she's told
Do you want to touch her?",Sex-Eye-Make-Up
The Glove,"Someone's evil laugh shoots down my back
Shapeless and aging we start to run
Through the tangle of your broken words
This cheap impulse falls so dry

In the maze. I burn down 
Turn... you turn my skin around
Wishing my eyes could look down
Wishing my eyes could look down
Down on me...

Stairs fall like jewels as we near the door
You fold through my neck and arms like crystal
So black, so black with charm and breath
We turn to face the dying sun...

This green city rains down on me
This green city rains down",This Green City
The Glove,"Your body grows more beautiful
With every move you make
Your body grows more beautiful
With every bite I take

You won't believe I love you
It's too stupid for words
So I lick your trembling lips
And use your hands to feed the birds

I laid with you for hours
Staring at your face
I laid with you for hours
Remembering your taste
And when the morning came
It splattered us in light
I think I left you sleeping there
I think I left you sleeping

Mouth to mouth, I asked you to stay
Mouth to mouth, but you're slipping away

Down seven stairs and first on the left
Arch your back and hold your breath
A million fat girls and a million fat men
Couldn't put me back together again",[Untitled Track]

Ask he said, and ask is what I did
A tone of plea for everything you get
And I feel too much has been made
Of my fault, I don't call a spade
Ask he said, ask for what you need
Don't be shy, shyness is a little girl
And I feel if you're scolded like a child
All your elders, were once scolded too
We're just
No eyes, just ends
We're just friends
Shut it, shut it...
Shut it, shut it...
Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't you care ---- just pull in
Ask he said, it's how you get advice
And more than that it's talking to them
There is magic but really there's no magic
In what appears
I get quiet, I feel it all the while
No one's touched me for such a long time
And I get wounds she bathes them in salt
Never to open lightning with a bolt
Ask he said, and don't ever suppose
If you don't ask then nobody knows
We're just
Some eyes it's not
Were just old friends

The Go-Betweens,"It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect sadness
To confine itself to it's causes. Like a river in flood,
When it subsides and the drowned bodies of
Animals have been deposited in the treetops, there is
Another kind of damage that takes place beyond the torrent.
At first, it seemed as though she had only left
The room to go into the garden and had been delayed by stray
Chickens in the corn. Then he had thought she might
Have eloped with the rodeo-boy from the neighboring
Property but it wasn't till one afternoon, when he
Had heard guitar playing coming from her room and
Had rushed upstairs to confront her and had seen
That it was only the wind in the curtains brushing
Against the open strings, that he finally knew she
Wasn't coming back. He had dealt with the deluge alright
But the watermark of her leaving was still quite visible.
He had resorted to the compass then, thinking that
Geography might rescue him but after one week in the
Victorian Alps he came back north, realizing that snow which
He had never seen before, was only frozen water.

But was it really possible for him to cope with the
Magnitude of her absence? The snow had failed him.
Bottles had almost emptied themselves without effect.
The television, a Samaritan during other tribulations, had
Been repossessed, she had left her traveling clock
Though thinking it incapable of functioning in
Another time-zone; so the long vacant days of expensive sunlight
Were filled with the sound of her minutes, with the measuring of her hours.",River of Money

Don't say this house is a shack.
Thunder cracked so I cracked back.
It's a fine line between love and despair;
Do vou know the times I've waited on your stair?
Don't say you've got a home and new life,
I won't stand in your way 'cause
You're someone else's wife.",Someone Else's Wife
The Go-Betweens,"I was slowly dying in a clinic just outside of L.A.
You came and saw me that picked me up straight away.
You said learn to dance, learn to act, learn the piano
And most of all you said
Learn to live again

That's when it starts, that's when it starts.
The electric train of soft cylinder parts.
Together at last.

I dream of losing you, I wake up holding you so tight.
I don't want to lose you now that I've passed midnight.
I'm in deep with the blue waters around you.
I'm in deep, so blue with everything around you.

That's when it starts, that's when it starts.
The electric train of soft cylinder parts.
Together at last.

That's when it starts, that's when it starts.
The electric train of soft cylinder parts.
Together at last.

Hey, that's when it starts. 
Hey, that's when it starts.
The electric train of soft cylinder parts
The dull mask of action on circus staff
Mobility the hood of the Hindu scarf
Together at last
Making jewellery at last.

Hey St. Jame's Park,
Hey St. Jame's Park
Hey, hey",Spirit of a Vampyre
The Go-Betweens,"Tallulah took a shower for an hour,
Then walked down the street feeling beautiful and clean.
Taulah met a man at a newsstand,
Who asked her how does she dream.
What she's missing
Is someone
Who will listen
And then and then and then, you tell me.

Tallulah your make-up needs a shake-up,
Your hair frames a perfect face.
Tallulah wasn't liberated,
By France or any other revolution.
What she's missing
Is someone
Who will listen
And then and then and then, you tell me.

You tell me, I have a choice. 
You, you, you. 
Come on.",You Tell Me
The Go-Betweens,"It rains for days
So you stay inside and lock your door
Cryin' all the time
Crying for, you don't know what for

You say, you're undone by his kiss
But don't you think
That for once in your life
It should be like this

Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue

I'm keepin' you right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here

Climb aboard my pony
Now, you've been thrown
Get back in the saddle
And let it be known

That you're made of steel
But don't you think that
For once in your life
He should be made to feel

Your hands are tired

Right here, right here

The Go-Betweens,"The clouds are here
They aren't up in the sky.
I cupped them with my hands
and reached up high.
I said to these clouds,
""no more am I blind.
I have to see straight
and that will make me unkind.""

Visions of blue,
I'm angry, I'm wise.
And you, you're under cloudy skies.
Blue air I crave, blue air I breathe
They once chopped my heart the way you chop a tree.
Told to equate achievement with pain
I took their top prize and paid them back with rain.

Visions of blue
I'm angry I'm wise and you.
You're under cloudy skies.
Blue air I crave blue air I breathe
they once chopped my heart the way you chop a tree.
Told to equate Achievement with Pain
I stole their top prize and paid them back with rain.

Visions of blue I'm angry I'm wise and you.
You're under cloudy skies. Visions of blue
Perverse and strong and you.
You're under cloudy skies.
What I did once I now do everyday.",Clouds
The Go-Betweens,"I don't want to let you out of my sight
Don't want to let you onto your flight.
The fortune teller might have been right
The bad old world can turn your hair white.

And sometimes we don't come through
Sometimes we just get by
But I know with you
I've never seen the devil's eye.

I don't want to have to say a goodbye
Don't want to wipe the tear from your eye
I took this chance to write a message
It's just to say that I'll miss you.

And sometimes we don't come through
Sometimes we just get by
But I know with you
I've never seen the devil's eye.",The Devil's Eye
The Go-Betweens,"If the cliffs were any closer
If the water wasn't so bad
I'd dive for your memory
On the rocks and the sand

I'd dive for you
Like a bird I'd descend
Deep down I'm lonely
And I miss my friend

When I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

We stood side by side
Strong and true
I just wish you'd remember
Bad times don't get you through

When I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

Now, I dive black waters
The waters of her dream
Are black and forgetful
I'd like to make them clean

When I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

When I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
And we stood that chance

Yeah, we did

The Go-Betweens,"There's a cat in the alleyway
Dreaming of birds that are blue
Sometimes girl when I'm lonely
This is how I think about you
There are times that I want you
I want you so much I could bust
I know a thing aboat lovers
Lovers lie down in trust

Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway

The people next door got their problems
They got things they can't name
I know a thing about lovers
Lovers don't feel any shame
Late at night with the lights down low
The candle burns to the end
I know a thing about darkness
Darkness ain't my friend

I'm gonna make you happy
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna cut your strings

I put my foot flat down on the floor
I took it as far as I could
I took it down there to Sheridan Street
By the dark wood
Late at might when I want you
I lock you in my room
I know a thing about darkness
I know a thing about lovers
I know a thing about lovers
Lovers want the moon

Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway

",Love Goes On!
The Go-Betweens,"I'm ten feet under water
Standing in a sunken canoe
Looking up at the waterlilies
They're green and violet blue
Still the sun it finds
A place to light me
Still the sun it finds
That it's warm beside me.

Green and violet blue
No matter what you say no matter what you do
I want to be the one and
Love is a Sign.

The letters that were writing
Baby they just break our hearts
And when we get back together again
There's just no time to start.

No time to restore
It's all on the ground
What you've been doing
Against what I've found.

And this is what I find
No matter what you say no matter what you do
I want to be the one and
Love is a Sign.

I'm not a playboy or a poet
There's no cool water from the well
I wish you had a big house
And that your work would start to sell.

Wave after wave
Our tension and our tenderness.
Wave after wave
Our tension and our tenderness.
Green and violet blue
No matter what you say no matter what you do
I want to be the one and
Love is a Sign.

I know I'll see you again
The world is too big or too small.
I won't be the madman then
It will be me that's come to call.

Me in freezing weather
Snow cuffs on my wrist.
You down by the river
London no longer exists.

This is what I find
No matter what you say no matter what you do
I want to be the one and
Love is a Sign.",Love Is a Sign
The Go-Betweens,"The heater's on
The windows are thin
I'm trying hard
To keep this warmth in
I turn to her
She's sound asleep
Someplace I don't know
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

[Chorus]
I tried to tell you
I can only say it when were apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet heart.

Two hours on
My eyes are open
There's bad blood between us
What did I say
That made you cry?
Our dream won't die
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go.

[Chorus]

What is that light?
that small red light 
Scorpio rising
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

The Go-Betweens,"Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

Don't the sun look good today?
But the rain on its way
Watch the butcher shine his knives
And this town is full of battered wives.

Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

I ride your river under the bridge
I take your boat out to the reach
'Cause I love that engine roar
But I still don't know what I'm here for

Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

They shut it down
They closed it down
They shut it down
They pulled it down

Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town",Streets of Your Town
The Go-Betweens,"She comes home and she's happy
She comes home and she's blue
She comes home and she tells him
Listen baby we're through

I don't know what happened next
All I know is she moved
Packed up her bags and her curtains
Left him in his room

Was there anything I could do?
She went out with her paint box
Paints the chapel blue
She went out with her matchsticks
Torched a carwash too
I don't know where she's living
All I got is a card

A picture of her at the pyramids
A knife held to her heart
Was there anything I could do?
She came down from the mountains
Said goodbye to her guru
She went back to her room
Lost herself in voodoo

I don't say that I blame her
People don't know what they want
If you spend your life looking behind you
You don't see what's up front
Was there anything I could do?
Putting out her fire

Who can be tempting you, you
Look like a winter.

You can't say no forever 
You can't say no forever. 
I've tried.

Run! if you have to run up to the mountain
Air a writer's retreat maybe. 
Sheltered and lonely there a fireplace and a rocking
Chair you understand me.

You can't say no forever 
You can't say no forever. 
I've tried.

You can't say no in December as the trees
Lined the drive. I'm sure your family
Remembers me by your side.

Night! as your clothes discard he asks
Was your day hard you can barely answer
""Yes my world's tumbling down
Stone by stone to the ground""
Please take out the garbage.

You can't say no in December a piano
Played by a child's hand drifts over the
Verandah and I'm your man.

The Go-Betweens,"She comes from Ireland
She's very beautiful
I come from Brisbane 
I'm quite plain
She's from the mountains, so close to heaven
Clouds on her shoes, stars on her chest

I love Lee Remick, she's a darling

She was in The Omen with Gregory Peck
She got killed, what the heck
Her eyes are like gems
She's an actress for Screen Gems 

I love Lee Remick, she's a darling

Her hair's red, but it's not dye
If I touched her, I know I'd want to cry

The Go-Betweens,"Candles and tambourines shine in the dusk
Monkeys and Spoonful float through the musk
Why when you come here 
Does the rainbow turn black?
Spitting and burning, the vision attacks
But then the clock turns and its now
and its you
Ghosts from the river beg to get in
Staining my windows with pictures of sin 
Sometimes the night time steals all your light
Then in the morning the birds lift and fly
But then the clock turns and its now
and its you",The Clock
The Go-Betweens,"I lived in seclusion for a couple of years

In a german farmhouse just drinking beer

And every morning I'd wake up with a smile from ear to ear



I had one contact to the outside world

A phone in london and a seasick girl.

I knew what was happening but only in my part of the world



I knew what was happening

I knew that this was my world

I knew what was happening in my part of the world



There was an abandoned castle with empty chairs

There was a rumour pavarotti would sing there

To raise funds for a music school but then the

Whole thing vanished into thin air



It was a crazy idea

And it vanished into the air

It was a falling down castle with falling down stairs



I could walk the streets unrecognized

Nobody stopped me I was never surprised

By anybody's actions or by an ex-lover's eyes



And this felt good

And this felt so right

To be unloaded as I walked through the night



This felt good

This felt so right



To be unloaded as I walked through the night, this felt right

The Go-Betweens,"You sure gotta funny way 
 Of hanging on to the Babylon
 Of the always gone and getting it wrong 
 Because it makes no difference to anyone 
 That you had your fun in the burning sun
 When you thought you'd won
 And I like your weird way of drifting low
 In the underflow, try letting go 
 And then you'll know 
 'cause sometimes change is a dirty word 
 When you're in the herd, yeah that's what I heard
 Did your kitten purr?
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 Midnight and hauntings and nights on the fly
 Moonlight on moorings with you on my mind
 If you go a little crazy when the light is black 
 Get on a different track, find out what you lack 
 And you'll make it back
 And it sure seems strange here in Hollywood
 But I'm looking good, I'll put on my hood 
 And dream of Birnam Wood
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on

The Go-Betweens,"He's got a four wheel drive that he takes to Double Island Point
He's got a relationship with a woman that he met in an Irish joint
I know the land 

And the colored sand

Everything's fresh at the source in this land
And I wish him luck
I hope he get's it right 
As he lives my live

He's got a house all to himself that overlooks a park
He's got a piano all to himself that he plays after dark
I know the sound 
As the sun goes down

Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down
Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down

As I live his life",He Lives My Life
The Go-Betweens,"How can I help you focus 
When all you do is choke us?
Try looking for me and wishing for me 
And kiss me softer than the rest
How can I help you dream 
When all you do is scream?
If I'm not allowed to be above the crowd
I don't want to be your guest
A one in a million smile
A silent number that I can't dial
But eyes so blue it's like falling through
An evening in the west 
What can I do to sway you?
Drop to my knees and pray you
Stop breathing the fumes of those other grooms
Then we really will be blessed

 I don't want to change a thing when there's magic 
 In here, now the coast is clear 
 I got no time for fear
 Time knocks you down like a rolling ball
 In memory hall
 Love leaves you clean like a waterfall
 Then you hit a wall, hit a wall

 I got no time for fear",Magic in Here

And wonder why you left me twice
The eerie sound of blade on lake 
Cracks my skin and I fill with ache
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
I see you running through the grass 
A doctors daughter, a sky of glass
My swollen eye at Sunday school
No saviour here under God's bright rule
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus Beach
I feel you breathing in my head
But better there if not in bed 
I wash your perfume from my clothes
I don't believe that affection goes
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus Beach",Orpheus Beach

 If you want to come on down and listen
 I'm ready
 And I might come along 
 With something that you've been missing
 I've got no money 
 I've got nothing at all
 But I'll keep you guessing
 And I'm bound 
 To hit the wall 
 And I'll be running 
 I'm no trouble
 I'm nothing like the trouble 
 That I used to be when I was somebody's double
 Do you have any whiskey?
 I don't like to drink 
 But I like to know that's it's along there with me
 There's nothing I've seen
 That's ever really 
 Flattened me
 And there's something 
 In the corner of your eye 
 That gets me
 Yes there's something 
 But I know 
 You'll keep me guessing 
 So what do you say 
 Tell me what you're thinking of 
 Tell me what you're thinking of this minute
 You're a spirit
 You're one thing greater 
 Than all the things that you are together
 You're one thing greater 
 Than all the things 
 You are together",Spirit
The Go-Betweens,"We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Some good looking people wearing

Lee cooper jeans

They're breaking on the headland, they're breaking on the shore

And when you're living in hawaii they're breaking at your door



We used to wet our fingers on surfing magazines

Going to throw school and follow those scenes

Going to get a kombi and go from beach to beach

Be the kind of people the authorities can't reach



We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Wake up in the morning and the waves are clean

Standing on the headland taking in the scene

Just like they do it ... in surfing magazines

at the five mile fence
bloodwood, bones + steers

you're never satisfied
you're running down the years

The Go-Betweens,"I opened a notebook, it read “The Darlinghurst Years”
I snapped it shut but out jumped some tears
I didn't have to read it, it all came back

Hidding behind her back
 
Gut rot cappuccino, gut rot spaghetti
Gut rot rock'n'roll through the eyes of Frank Brunetti
And always the traffic, always the lights
Joe played the cello through those

One more coffee and I must go
Back to my room more chapters to go 
We'll meet up in an alley with more places I know
 
I'm going to change my appearance everyday
I'm going to write a movie and then I'm going to star 
  in a play
I'm going to go to Caracas because you know I'm 
  just going to have to get away

The Go-Betweens,"Just pulled out of a train station we're moving sideways

But there's no reason to cry.

To the songs of Sacha
I need the touch of fingers on my skin

And drops its touch
On the fir trees in the wind

And a tower falls and the stars find you
This night's for you.

I find some feathers buried in the sand
I put them on and try to leave the land
Beyond the break horizons run unplanned
I wear your footprints tattoos in my hands

The Go-Betweens,"I lived in seclusion for a couple of years
In a German farmhouse just drinking beer
And every morning I'd wake up with a smile from ear to ear
I had one contact to the outside world

A phone in London and a seasick girl.
I knew what was happening but only in my part of the world
I knew what was happening 
I knew that this was my world
I knew what was happening in my part of the world

There was an abandoned castle with empty chairs
There was a rumor Pavarotti would sing there
To raise funds for a music school but then the 
whole thing vanished into thin air

It was a crazy idea 
And it vanished into the air
It was a falling down castle with falling down stairs
I could walk the streets unrecognized 

Nobody stopped me I was never surprised
By anybody's actions or by an ex-lover's eyes
And this felt good 
And this felt so right

The Go-Go's,"Last night you slept, you slept in fits
You smashed your windows bit by bit
You cried out, a bad dream
Horror pictures, what a scene!

Which way will things go tonight
Toss and turn or sleep tight
You can't win you wonder why
That sleep is one thing you can't buy

You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep

Watch the clock, you're waiting

Sometimes I think you care
And then you don't
Then I think you will

Find myself waiting to be sleeping
To be dreaming, to be worlds away

I wanna be worlds away apart from the day to day
I know I'll be okay when I get worlds away
Worlds away, worlds away, worlds away, worlds away

Slipping away to somewhere in my heart
Go to a world where no one's been before
That's when I find myself not quite sleeping
But still dreaming and I'm worlds away

I wanna be worlds away apart from the day to day
I know I'll be okay when I get worlds away
Worlds away, worlds away, worlds away, worlds away

How much have you bought
These days I feel too wise
I think we're sharing the same lies

We're all alone together
The calm hides stormy weather

Wind pushing birds around
Trees crashing against the window
Of a ghost hotel
I kissed you and swore I'd never tell
But you said it wasn't right

Rain pouring from the sky
Dashing down the boulevard
Watching the city from a tower
My head felt light
I knew I'd lost my heart
But I just said I hate heights

Why'd you say you loved me
That day, that day
When you new you wouldn't have me on
This day, this day
Now you're fine, I'm not okay
And I can only stay away
I can only kneel and pray
Try and try to forget that day

And though now I know you love some other one
I can't forget the things you said",Forget That Day

I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs

Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know looks sometimes deceive
Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

Head over heels
Where should I go
Can't stop myself
Outta control
Head over heels
No time to think
Looks like
The whole world's out of sync

Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart

[Chorus]",Head over Heels
The Go-Go's,"What you think of me is hard to tell
Double talkin' words that I can't spell

You're never seen once you've been heard

I'm the only fool
That's as big a fool as you
Got the only heart
And it beats as hard as yours
I'm the only one you run to
The one you come to
The only one you can get to
I'm the only one-only one for you
Only one for you

There's no need to play this silly game
No one wins and nothing's ever gained
You'd think by now that maybe you would see
But you're as blind to love as you are to me
I'm all for one, you're one for all
I got the only number you should call

 You're outta my sight I'm outta my mind
 We never bargained or planned on this
 We gotta hold on hold on

 I'm with you
 Hold me in your mind
 Keep the fire strong
 Without you
 Not really apart
 Our love goes on and on

 When we're together we pretend
 That we can take the time ''cause it'll never end
 It was so easy when love began
 We gotta hold on hold on

 Now I'm off another city in sight
 And I remember each and every night
 When I could touch you it felt so right
 that's why I hold on hold on

I just wanted to make you
I never meant to break you
He says:
Have some mercy on me
Do you have to be
Such a mercenary

She's scheming inside
Can't stop the wheels turning

There's no profit or learning

Just a gold-plated heart
So scared to be alone
It rips her apart

There may be some explanation
Why you feel the way you do
The world makes its rotations
But I just want to turn to you
Come on let me turn to you
Please let me turn to you
Why not let me turn to you
Just want to turn to you

It has a lot to do
With the fist time that we met
The wild dance in your eyes
Made up for what was never said
Gotta get my message

Stop spending all our precious time
Because before you know it
We'll be down to our last dime

You're my idea of a pretty view
You can move or so it seems
I bet we'd make a decent team

I'm not asking for all your time
A song or two would suit me fine
I'm not asking for you to say
That you'll be with me all the way

Shut your mind off for a while
Concentrate on the latest style
And everything's alright

[Chorus]
Yes or no
I'll take it fast or slow
I'll make it easy for you to decide
Yes or no
You've got to let it go
Just take a stance
Either dance or tell me no

If you've got somewhere to be
If you've got someone besides me
Let me know don't put me on
If it's not right then I'll be gone

Dancin' in their empty arms
Tangled up in the lives of others

Their sins are innocent
Don't you stop to wonder
What's goin' wrong
When everything you've ever loved
Has come and gone

You thought and never told me
You thought but that won't hold me
So much was left unspoken
Held in a heart now broken

Situations all invented
A million in your head

Char said, ""I've gotta go non-stop
Gonna stay up 'til we hit the top""
Soon the other stiletto would drop
For the sweethearts of pop

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain
Flowers bloom, they fade too soon
What happened to our daisy chain?

At number one not doing so fine
Still having some fun spilling the wine
The rising sun never felt too kind
We were out of our minds

Trying too hard to play the part
KV burned out like a shooting star
Been brought down by a broken heart
We were falling apart

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain

Remodeling the wreckage of my past

Even though it's obvious I've changed
Once I forgave you but I did not forget
Now I'm taking back everything I said

About the way I think and what I feel

To be temperamentally tranquilized

Falling down, the fools are laughing
They know the reason, they can't be happy now
Great, what does it mean to be great? To feel like it every day

In the land of second places the rule of thumb is try not to say it
Just hold your tongue and say it nicely
You change the subject ever so politely now
True, what does it mean to be true? Feeling your point of view

Work, keep working on it, work, keep working on it
Sometimes it could feel just like we're almost done
Endless streams of repetition
It looks like we're all wishing for something different

Paint your brain a thousand colors
When every color outside is black and white
We don't know which way we're really going
Wait, I know the right way, please, just wait a second
Stop, shut up the children, I know where I am

Bear a cool witness to another's pain
If you look closely we are all insane
It's just too great a load
Every break in the road

Tear it down with your own hands

I'm so sorry that you're dead I wish you could have stayed alive,
Find an ounce of peace of comfort and survived

It's a deep sould kind of poverty
It's a short ride to the hell to be
With a weight heavier than gravity
Do you reap what you've sowed
Every break in the road

Tear it down with your own hands

It's too great a load every break in the road

Do you know that?

And you can travel far

And that one is a flame
And this one is a spark

His scent swims around me
Like a perfume too heavy for summer
Me lost thing
Intoxicated
Curled within him
Drowning over and over

Charmed disarmed
He comes when least expected
Sits too close
Lingers too long
Stares too deeply
And claims me with something I cannot name

Lightheaded and clean
This is a gift
Biting tongue until blood
I am sick with him

Talk goes no deeper than tonight
Words are tickets to spend time
Skin is talking to skin
Loud

I know not to go too deep
But when his hands stop
Tremble, temptation
I thrill back
Open up
Crawl walls

This woman is no man's
This man is no one's
This one is mine

In a full room, alone on a couch
He is throned
Doesn't move
Knows I will come

Smitten
It vibrates
Makes drinks tremble
Food wastes time
Cigarettes are for curling smoke
And drawing me in

This is bloody business

Guilt makes for poor postcards
So he comes in for a while
What do we know of this?

Doesn't know if he'll be allowed to stay
But he looks a while too long
And stirs the close air
Dragging me to the bottom of the lake

Couches are for excuses
And temptation
Crushed in too deep to breathe
Swoon again skin you do not know
With hands that know too much
Of what you must never say

Flesh to curl to grind
To feign sleep to balance wishes
On tongues and wait for the time
Now

Cozy he calls me
Says I smell like sweet cream
Closed eyes bring on a luscious film
Of time and silence

He tastes like stars
He feels like thunder

Regret makes you bitter
He says
Come in and swim

We disappear into a dusk
We'll never own
And never quite shake

A luscious slice
Of water
Lack of sleep makes me drift
Lake of sleep makes me wonder

He will exist
He will evaporate
I am sick with him, gone

In regret dreams he is low and sweet
Dark like a drift storm
Holding me down under the waves
Telling me not to talk
Not to move
This will only take an hour
Or two",Drown
The Golden Palominos,"I eat only sleep and air
And everyone thinks I'm dumb
But I'm smart because I've figured it out.

I am slimmer than you are
And I am burning my skin off little by little
Until I reach bone and self
Until I get to where I am essential
Until I get to where I am

Food doesn't tempt me anymore
Because I am so full of energy and sense
I can even pass by water now
Because I am living off the parts of me
That I don't need anymore.

I could feel the slow drips of pain before,
Swirling inside where my lungs should have been.
Now I'm clean inside.

I threw out hundreds of things that I didn't need anymore.
All my dresses and bras
Stupid things like jeans and socks.
Most days I float through the house naked
So I can see myself in the mirrors.
I have hundreds of them everywhere
And they talk back to me all the time.
They keep me true and pure.
They make sure I'm still here.

When I knew what I had to do
I took all my notebooks, all my manuscripts
And ate them page by page
So I could take my words with me.

I can finally control my life and even death
And I will die slowly like steam escaping from a pipe.

This is my greatest performance
And all of the actresses who won my parts will say
How wonderful to let yourself go that mad,
How wonderful to go on this kind of journey
And not care if you come back to tell the story.

I scratch words on the walls now
So people will visit this museum and know
How someone like me ends up like this
(they'll say there is art in here somewhere).

Everything that comes out of me is sacred
Every tear, every cough, every piss.
Everything that comes off of me is sacred
Every fingernail, every eyelash, every hair.

Starvation is sacred and I scratch my bones
Against the windows at night.
I light candles and feel myself evaporate.
This body is a little church, a little temple.
You can't see me now because I've gone inside.

My family doesn't call anymore.
My friends don't call anymore.
You can't hurt me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
Only I can.

And that's okay.
I don't need them anymore.
I can live off of me.
I speak to me.
I dance with me.
I eat me.

When they find me, I'll have a little smile on my face
And they'll wrap me in a white cloth and lay me in the ground
And say they don't understand.
But I do.
I don't hurt anymore.
I'm not lonely anymore.
I'm not sad I'm not pretty anymore.
I made it through.

I feel so holy and clean when I stretch out on the floor and sing.
Sometimes god comes in for a minute and says I'm doing fine, I'm almost there.

Every day I get a little closer to vanishing.
Some days I can't stand up because the room moves under my feet
And I smile because I'm almost there,
I'm almost an angel.

One day when I am thin enough
I'll go outside
Fluttering my hands so I can fly
And I will be so slight that I will pass through all of you

She's barely gone, and you're barely here
Here comes the cocaine wake up call

And like a boy, not a slave to fame
You kissed lipstick only after money came
Born in New York 30 years ago, you've died several times since

Drive through tunnels and crawl through caves,
And suffer through a life no city can save
They've got an unmarked car with your name on it

So she smoked to keep from eating
And you fucked her to keep from feeling
And that was a taste, and that was a waste
Now these are all of your days magnified

Back when things were simple

I couldn't care cause I'm already there

Turn around and face the clock
I'd sit and watch, as time went hopping by
I'm still growing up
My friends are growing old before my eyes
Count the stars above
Wonder when the heavens will subside
Knowing our two worlds
Will someday just collide
I couldn't care cause I'm already there.

The Goo Goo Dolls,"Even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away
All the dreams you never thought you'd lose got tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away
Now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
If you could hide inside me, maybe for awhile,
and I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is never far
And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
Don't make you sad to know that life is more than who you are?
Grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe
Reruns  all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio,
And I won't tell 'em your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are
Come back down and I won't tell 'em your name",Name

You abused me when I'm outta line 
You tried to warn me of the danger sign

You drive me to distraction in a primitive way

The Goo Goo Dolls,"And you asked me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words and sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

I need some place simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's ten million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

So take these words and sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

With blue eyes that never cry
All you remember now
Is what you feel

In midnight conversations

But you turned away

Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain

And you remain
A promise unfulfilled

Tries to tear us down again

The Good Brothers,"Hey where did we go,
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow,
Playin' a new game,
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl,
You my brown eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing,
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and sliding
All along the water fall, with you
My brown eyed girl,
You my brown eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing,
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da

So hard to find my way,
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My how you have grown,
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you

Pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind

Did you ever have to finally decide
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide

Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
You heart gets stolen by some mousey little girl

And then you know you'd better make up your mind...

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you a line
And says, ""You better go home, son, and make up your mind""

And then you bet you'd better finally decide...",Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind

The Good Life,"He met this girl from reno

Whose life was a competition.
She looked just like a china doll
With porcelain skin she knew he'd let her win.
So he fell for her,

As if he fell from his mother into the arms of a lover.
And he swore not to leave her side,
For better or for worse (whichever comes first).
Sadly the latter arose.

She met this boy from omaha
Whose life was handed to him...
But still, he wanted everything.
His dreams were his ruin,

And she couldn't wake him up.
But the bough broke and he fell.
Like the time he fell from his mother
Into the arms of a doctor.

So he cried like that first day of his life.
He knew he had broken this beautiful porcelain
And how could their world be the same?
And so it never was the same.

She whispers his name,
""I'll stay if you want, but I could never be who you
Imagined me to be I'll stay I don't know what else to do...
But I can't change for you I won't change for you""",The Competition
The Good Life,"Mostly I sleep it off
It's easier in the morning
To shrug off the evening's
Drunken pathetic pleas
Cause the night's tragic rambling
Is the next day's apologies
So if you can sit tight
'Til the sun hits the blinds
We can settle everything,
Oh no.

Turning on a dime
I just can't trust my instincts
One day my heart beats with passion
The next it waxes back
If I seem a little callused
I assure you it's just a scratch
So if you can hold on
'Til the mood swings are gone
Then we might just have a chance,
Oh no.

Baby, I quit
I just can't fake it anymore
I'm an indulgent selfish, abusive
Disfunctional fuck-up
I needed to be rescued
I'm stranded on myself
And I can't escape from this island I made
I'm afraid I never will,
Oh no",I Am an Island
The Good Life,"In pile of unpaid bills
There's a letter sent from Philadelphia
In a familiar hand, she hasn't opened it just yet
There's no telling what is says
Oh darling please, I'm down on one knee

So why? Can't I be him, that guy in all your dreams?
The one with all those qualities, impossible to achieve
That man you thought I'd be
So flawless, so honest, that could never be me
Well that ain't me

There's some flowers on her desk,
Doesn't he know how embarrassed she gets, receiving gifts
She hasn't opened up her card
The bouquet it says it all, DAFFODILS with baby's breath
The same bouquet she caught on their first date
That night he was a king

he flew in town for business
And ended up at the wedding
They shared life stories, between drinks
She loved him so quickly, and left him just the same
Yeah, he's still the same, he's still the same
No, he's nothing new, but he hasn't changed

always a bridesmaid, her friends all settled down
Always a bridesmaid, she dropped her bouquet on the ground
They snuck out for a cigarette
She said â??Maybe it's the whiskey sours, but I think this could be itâ?¦
Â?¦if you ask me, here and now, I think, no I know, I could make
Those wedding vows, we could sneak off in the night, andâ?¦
I could Be The Bride
I could Be The Bride
Alright, I could Be The Bride

'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight.
Last minute have-to-dos:
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP.
No, thanks. No party lights.
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax,
Turn down all of my invites.
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called; Halloween party.
Waited all night for him to show.
This time his car wouldn't go.
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late.
Trudge on home to celebrate.
In a quiet way unwind.
Doing Christmas right this time.

And he has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey.
Already in the oven, nice and hot.
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot.
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year.
'Spending this one alone,' he said.
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy.'
I said 'Me too, but why are you..
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed.
Caught on to what was happening.
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending.

Breeze behind the sun

The force of the feeling that got you so down 
Will you ever forgive me

I was never sure how or why
Before the war and the tidal wave engulfed us all it's true how the world has changed
And I was learning how to change with you

We saw the green fields
Turn into stone
Such lonely homes
All in a badman's dream
He ain't asleep
It's just a dream

In the darkest hour the song had gone it passed among the people I hardly knew
And I was losing it all the time
But she stayed with me and found me out and above all things I've learnt
It's that honesty that secures the bond in the heart

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It might make sense for me t'tangle

With my wife for awhile

So don't trouble no policeman

He's got a wife and kids of his own

And don't trouble yer neighbor

Cause they just want to be left alone

Lord ain't this nation lonely

The Gourds,"Oh maria hands it out

She comes from Guatemala

She helps me get around

She helps when I'm in trouble

When the ice cream hit the ground

The federales they were a'coming

She had made arrangements with a vendor

The stupid gringo - he got away

Now if I had a $100's

And maracas in my hand

I'd shake them for maria

I'd pressure her old man

To let me take her back to texas

In the white pickup truck

Where she had done a dozen favors

To get me out of dutch

La...

Now we never spank the children

And the house is pretty small

And I never learned the language

Of old guatamal

But there are frijoles when I'm hungry

And I drink tequila when I'm dry

And the coffee is oh so good

And maria hands it out

The Gourds,"Flyin down this hill on my schwin 
Well I guess this is where it all begins 
Go in sandburg come out like ray charles 
An odor of jasmine for yer flowers 
Sometimes on my bicycle rides 
These pleasantries fall from the trees 
Little Quixote's fished out like floaties 
From the bevy of yer choice 

Ladies choice 

Flyin down this hill on my schwin 
Well I guess it all could have ended then

The streets firmly paved ways 
Coupled with speed and gravity 
And the craniums tendency 
To leak vital information 
All over the road to recovery",Ladies Choice

It ain't funny you say okay I had it up to here with you

The Gourds,"Dooley was a good ol' man
He lived below the mill
Dooley had two daughters
And a forty-gallon still.
One gal watched the boiler
The other watched the spout
And momma corked the bottles
When ol' Dooley fetched them out.

CHORUS:
Dooley, slipping up the holler
Dooley, trying to make a dollar
Dooley, give me a swaller
I'll pay you back some day.

The revenuers came for him
Slipping through the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
He never lost his goods.
Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the tub.

CHORUS

I remember very well
The day ol' Dooley died
The women folk looked sorry
The men stood around and cried.
Now Dooley's on the mountain
He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for a stone.

You count the hours just hoping he shows

That I'm the one who loves you so much
While you're longing for his embrace
You're all alone there with tears on your face

And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want but 
I sure 'nuff the one you need 
Oh baby I may not be the one you want 
But I know I'm the one you need

He's out fooling round with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
Just waiting 'till he has time for you

Gets hard to bear

And when you need a little tender loving care

The Graduate,"Don't shut me out
I don't wanna live inside your lost and found
You spin a story
With every other word you say
Another lie convincing me to stay

You only listen to my stare
And until I'm crushed beyond repair

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone, all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way
To live with the loss

You've got me wound up too tight
Don't catch on till it's too late
Keep me moving like a moth to flame
Zoom by you at first sight
Every time I try to get away
Something new's convincing me to stay

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone, all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way
To live with the loss

Could I have changed it
What more could I have sacrificed
There's always something to say
Stop me before I go to waste

Play with my love
Rip it up till I say enough

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way

",All At Once
The Graduate,"Leave all your clothes buried in the sand
Who knows when we'll be coming back again
Come on in, man, the water's getting cold
See if you sink or swim or float

When the tide came in we tried to act surprised
What could the ocean want
With the things that we left behind
Swimming back to land and I realized
It was the only time that year I felt alive

We booked a one way going overseas
Feels like I'm living someone else's dream
I tried my best to keep from turning back
I'm scared, you may have been my better half

Oh, I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke
I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke

And the story ends the same as it began
I never know when I'll be coming around again
Staring at the sand I realized
It was the only time that year that I felt alive

I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke
I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke

This could be my undoing

And I can't wait to be there
When all my bided time and dragging
Through my days comes to an end

Just a phase and we will finally
See the truth in everything

All of my dreams are filling a cesspool
So many things I couldn't handle
We are corrupt to the core
This guilt is gonna fill me up till I overflow

Still I want more that I can't win
Make this bided time and dragging
Through my days, come to an end

Such a shame that we may never
See the truth in everything
We can't explain

'Cause hope has never been enough
To be sure is asking for too much
Everything I try seems so impossible
Everything I have would be enough
For someone else but I want more

Careening all directions
Just don't know where to go

And out of mind

Still only hanging on
Time is passing by
And nothing seems
To change my mind
I'm still lonely with you

Play by the rules
And all you do is lose
Just don't know where to go
I'm not convinced
Cold is slowly building thicker skin
Today I'm taking back my loneliness

So move me slow

I will meet you on the other side

Just don't know where to go

I woke to the engine stop
Plan a course outside
Just to get caught up
By every obstacle along the way

So much to explain
And only a single day
To plead my case
There's nothing else to do
Just hope it's not too late

For far too long I kept you in the dark
Can't believe it took so long to start

How can I find you now
'Cause it feels like time is running out
And I said when I left
That I would not ever let you down
Gotta find my way back somehow

I am much older now
And I feel like time is running out
When we get to the end
Can you promise that you'll be around
If I make you that promise now

Back out on the endless road
That's become my home
This entire year
On the lamb has shown me
All the more that this is in my blood

I don't mean to alarm
But the past two months
Have left me hysterical
It's time for something new
I get crazy without you

And all along we tried to keep apart
Can't believe it took so long to start

How can I find you now
'Cause it feels like time is running out
And I said when I left
That I would not ever let you down
Gotta find my way back somehow

I am much older now
And I feel like time is running out
When we get to the end
Can you promise that you'll be around
If I make you that promise now

Take it slow, keep it down
Put this mess in the ground
Just my love, you came around
Now it seems we'll let it shine

Put this mess in the ground

The Graduate,"Can't see the path ahead
But I can smell the rain
Hide beneath the canopy
I never would complain

Eyes on the sky
We see the darkness start to grow
We could build a fire
Or just wait to drive

Either way I'm fine
I'm alive, I'm home

We traded everything
And left the country side
Metal towers, skylines
Over lucid starlit nights

Found a north side neighborhood
That we could call our own
I'm just fine, I'm alive
I am home

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see your face again
I'm taking on the world to give you
Everything you need while I'm away

They don't call us anymore
I can't remember feeling less alone

While you sleep
You could never stand
To watch me leave

Wake up with the sun, pull me in
And I'm in love

 And only learned how much you're capable of pain

Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round

When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show

Are beginning to show in my face

I know I'm no Christian

Throw out your lifeline

On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow

I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain

Now as the years roll on

Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing
Hurry don't be late

I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing

We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
You should be dancing

Far away in a land that is fair.
Happy landings to you, Amelia Earhart
Farewell, first lady of the air.

Although the fuel within the tanks was low.
But they'd land on Howland Island to refuel her monoplane,
Then on their trip around the world they'd go.

Well, a half an hour later an SOS was heard,
The signal weak, but still her voice was brave.
Oh, in shark-infested waters her plane went down that night
In the blue Pacific to a watery grave.

Well, now you have heard my story of that awful tragedy,
We pray that she might fly home safe again.

We'll ne'er forget Amelia and her plane. Chorus

Leaving my poor darling alone, 
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone. 

Now I have a grand ship on the ocean, 
All mounted with silver and gold, 
And before my poor darlin' would suffer, 
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold. 

Now if I had the wings of an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly, 
And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darlin', 
And there I'd be willing to die.

In them hollarin' pines
And he made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time

Long one evening in back of my house,
Caleb came around
And he called my name 'til I came out
with no one else around

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
but when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your darlin gone?
Did he go down off the mountain side
and leave you all alone?

Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
to do some business there.
Then Caleb threw that bottle down 
and grabbed me by my hair.

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
but when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name


He threw me in the needle bed,
across my dress he lay
he held my hands above my head
and I commenced to pray.

I cried My God, I am your child
send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips,
the bottle neck I found

I drew that glass across his neck
as fine as any blade,
and I felt his blood pour fast and hot
around me where I laid.

Because I've treated you unkind
But maybe you've found somebody new

Is you're no longer feeling the way I feel for you

The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Alway beneath the cold damp ground

It seems but a short time ago
That he was in the fullest bloom
But death, alas, has laid him low
Another victim to the tomb

Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed

On a Savior's summons he was readied
On his journey home to go
And fearless though near the dark valleys
Washed in his blood whiter than snow

Holding out for you out there
And like an arrow through my heart

On my lips when I close my eyes

Some other neighbors have been good enough to share

And I reach across the bed and wonder

So river of sand will you carry me home
'Cause I don't understand how to make it alone?
Where the water runs free for the sunlight to dance
Just wanna come back on a river of sand

What's so bad about rain on your town?
All the dew on the ground when the sunrise began
Let it come 'round again

I got nothing but time here to kill
No big glance, no true love
Just the 'Will I be thrilled?'
So would you wash me away?

So river of sand will you carry me home?
'Cause I don't understand how to make it alone
Where the water runs free for the sunlight to dance
Just wanna come back on a river of sand

I don't know what to say so I won't ask
Know the right words to pray my way back

I learned to work with my hands out on these waves

I would die alone here one cold November day

I heard that you did take
My brother in the morning another without warning
Sha, la, la, la, la, la
And who am I to think that I'd be any different as God as my witness

I saw Davy Jones underneath the water
With a thousand of my fathers calling me home
And I saw Davy Jones wavin' his black flag countin' up his bones

They say when I was five
The day I cast my first line I fell over the port side
Sha, la, la, la, la, la
As I was sinkin' down
I heard my mama singing, I heard the church bells ringing
Sha, la, la, la, la, la
But when they pulled me in I felt him tuggin' my hand

I saw Davy Jones underneath the water
With a thousand of my fathers calling me home
And I saw Davy Jones wavin' his black flag countin' up his bones

Now the waves have snapped the mast
I'm takin' water so fast I let go of the lines
And I could feel my father's stare from beyond the grave somewhere
As I fail him one last time

'Cause I would never be the man he thought I should be
The lesser of his sons
So Jesus help me now, help me to forgive him
Before the darkness floods in

I'll get a ferry and ride to a higher ground
Far from Rivertown

Alone I walk the streets all are lined with potholes
Left bruises on my feet, on my feet, bruises on my feet

Weathered sheets of awning at the green grocer store
Been falling down on the side walk
For fifteen years or more, fifteen years or more

So you gave away your heart, you gave it all away
Still you figured from the start it might turn out that way

And your tears are all gone you'll find water in the well

When your perfect plan's not all that it could be
Still you're doing all you can to find a remedy
For the bruises to your pride, time is coming soon
The time to stop the slide dance to a different tune

You'll find water in the well when all hope is lost
And your tears are all gone you'll find water in the well

Hear the echo of the pain recede into the night
Though a memory remains the urge you can defy
Now the clouds have disappeared, the sun is shining through
Your eyes are white and clear, a sky of golden blue

And your tears are all gone you'll find water in the well
When all hope is lost, when all hope is lost

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

You don't need X-ray vision or a super power to be

The initial fee is seven, but after that it's free
It's like a tree, and I go deeper than what you see on the surface
Servicin' all; relax, quit feelin' nervous
Stand up tall, face the music

Take advantage, go 'head and use it
Profusion with the rest, and I feel the (unknown) just stupid
I have trooped with many groups through this land of the enchanted
Waiting for my turn to have my wishes granted

[Chorus: x 2]

At the beginning of this weakness was the foolish and the ultimate hope lost
Wanting to turn iron into gold to roll the Earth off
Of the same axis, to rotate throughout the gate
Causin' ripples of tide

And distortion of space-time continuum
I'm doin' somethin' also would hurt
So prepare for the work of a king
Minus perk I'm a jerk
Your far thought two and two upset to just rest on the pillow of death
And just rest

The top

Gonna bag it up and take it home
We got that shit sewn fit-formed to my palms
So everyone just sit calm

I'm just a simple man
I like pretty things
I'm a simple man, really
I'm just a simple man
I like pretty things; I like funny things

I like my high hats on eight notes
Basic, don't double up the flow
I ride the beat; you chase it
Hennessey straight with the lemon squeezed to quench
Sounds from the town, they pound with intent
Experiment with this like it's different 'cause it is
They make the norm, and it's not what I live
I give my all and want to ball like y'all
But I can only spit my shit, you get it?
I'm not a clone; I got a zone, and Grouch fits in
Forever rockin' twenty-dollar pants to the end
I stand six-one and eat food with cheese in it
Make g's and spend it at the music store
I never use no more than my head to be led where I'm goin'
Knowin' points of interest well
And with the sense it takes to make underground tapes dope
I formulate how I set sail
Whether direct or retail I prevail on tracks
A few bars deep and bizarro on scratch [Ah, yeah]
Borrow from a batch of, let's say, garbage-ass records
Not too safe to me with few exceptions
True direction comes from inside the mind
And everything else is just accessories
That is my recipe for life, invest in me
I want my lady here tonight caressin' me

I like funny things; I like cheap things

Give me the body of a goddess ???? from God
It's odd how things fall in place
I'm all about good taste, expensive or not
No sensitive spot in you, I like what I got
Now don't mistake man for mind, 'cause I'm not simple-minded
Just logical, efficient and completely on time
With my thoughts in the process always bring progress
I guess this clockwork enabled me to not work
Nine to five, I rhyme and drive to eat
Check the Internet, fuck and make a beat
Go to wack show, sometimes it's still fun
We criticize fools for bitin' on Big Pun
Since this is the West Coast I like my hip-hop bumpin'
Get heated off some wax with the side of sayin' something
In the trunk and in the earphones
I'll make it clear, homes
I'm all about how it sounds
I deal with audio
My graffiti looks like shit
I dress how I dress and can't really dance a lick
The chance is this shit might never catch on

And with a quick flick of the wrist the man was dead
And his soul left his body and went down down down
To a place we laughingly refer to as hell
But none of us will ever go there because we're all far too groovy
The man's body was left to rot on the gallows
And a great multitude of black birds came and picked the man's corpse apart
Piece by piece
Limb by limb
Until nothing remained
And his blood melted into the ground below

The gallows was made from a tree created by God
The man's blood dripped into the ground which was created by God
Even the giant cloaked figure which was the man's own end was created by God
Even the man's soul which went down was created by God
Even the black birds which picked the man's corpse apart were created by God
And where was God?

In Flanders Fields the poppies grow
Between the crosses row on row
To mark the dead

To Flanders Fields the hippies go
To smoke the poppies there below
And feed their heads

And they're all friends of mine, each and every one of them, no better or no worse
And we'll probably end up down there together when it's all over

And that's why we say

It's all over and it's all right.",Friends of Mine

The Guess Who,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Humpty's Blues/American Woman (Epilogue)

Figures made of pedigrees control the non-existent soul of John Smith
Walk the creature let it run but slacken not the rope to which it's bound
Ships in bottles cannot sail and neither can a tombstone kill a feather

The Guess Who,"I was lost and tossed on a misty morning by a drunken sailor 
and the genie in the bottle let me down,
I was raised on Cain, in the name of the Father and the Mother 
and the brother and the other who was never even round,
On a windswept coast with the Black Knight falling 
I was heard to be calling that my ship and all its crew were going down,
As the sun ran slowly by a childhood rivulet a jeweled King summoned me, 
commanding that I run and tell the town,
Saw you, saw me, run quickly now,
Run and hide away,
Run and hide today.

In a room in a castle full of faceless lovers 
I was cut and bleeding and the image in the mirror struck me down,
I was chased and beaten by a well-drilled team of little men 
breathing colors and abandoned in a coffin in the ground,
As a pale young virgin made a meal of a martyr 
she was hailed as Holy by the only ones who stood and held their ground,
When a bright Mona Lisa with the eyes of a tiger read a new proclamation 
I was stricken from her list and never found,
Saw you, saw me, run quickly now,
Run and hide away,
Run and hide today.
Seems they come and go so quickly,
Disappear like sunlight in the evening,
And they may not ever be explained.

Seems like they come and go so quickly,
Disappearin' in the air like a breath of wind,
And they may not ever be explained,
And I woke up thinkin' I was dyin',
If you find one hang on with all you got
Way down deep, deep in your soul,
For it may not ever come again,
And I woke up crying like a baby,
Hey yay yay yay
No they may not ever be explained.",Dreams
