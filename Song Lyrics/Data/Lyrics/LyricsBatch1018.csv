Megadeth,"Make up the rules for me to live by 
Rules you break and just let it slide 
You try and find you inside of me 
Be as great as you want me to be 
Hypocrite, the word that fits 
Do as you say 
Not as you do 
You're pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint 
Self esteem you seem to lack 
Point the finger 
There's three pointing back 
Control's the illusion with all good intent 
Bad times are contagious 
You laugh and infect 
Criticist, the word that fits 
Put me down to lift you up 
Watching pain's your only pleasure 
Fascination for sick disaster 
Suffering since you were born 
Mess with the bull and you get the horns. 
Misery, the word that fits 
Times are good when times are bad 
""In my opinion as a professional I recommend we straight-jacket the son of a 
bitch, lock him in a rubber room, sedate him, heavily, and when he wakes up, if 
he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy"" 
""Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt him"" 
""Let's do it!"" 
""Sedate me? Cool! a straight jacket? Hey, hey, let go of me!"" 
You push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Don't push me, you piece of shit!

Megadeth,"Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today 
The more insatiable the sex, the more swelled our tongues became 
As prehistoric as this seems, this is now, today 
Talkin' about no vision, talkin' about no dream 
The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks 
I look above and see entrails in the sky 
This one ain't over until the fat lady dies 
One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast 
Ten Diadems to crown them all 
World religion at his feet 
Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come 
So run my child and hide your face 
Once you've been marked you're finished, one 
You've become one! 
You're mine! 
You're one. 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away 
Vengeance is mine! 
Vengeance is mine! 
The Netherworld and Sheol and never satisfied 
So the eyes of man are never satisfied 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away

Megadeth,"I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see 

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' shot down
And I'm feeling mean 

No more Mister nice guy
No more Mister clean
No more Mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene 

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
My mom's been thrown out of the society circle
My dad's had to hide

I went to church incognito
And everybody rose, the reverend Smith
He recognized me
Punched me in the nose

Megadeth,"Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I want to be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you 
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated 

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you, problem 

I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order 

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem 

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem
The problem is you, you got a problem
Oh what you gonna do?
They know a doctor, gonna take you away
They take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem the problem is you
Problem, well, what you gonna do?
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem, well you got a problem

Megadeth,"Born from the dark,
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below,
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy,
Hit them in their sleep,
And when all is won and lost,
The spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead,
With mud and straw, blood and sweat,
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Ensuing power vacuum,
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire,
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face a kiss,
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass,
A worldwide suicide

Megadeth,"Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all

A tout le monde
A tout les Amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
There are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred",A Tout le Monde [Radio Edit]

Megadeth,"I lied just a little 
When I said I need you 
You stretched the truth 
When you said that you knew

There's nothing to say 
I was almost honest, almost 
Living alone, can't stand this place 
It's four in the morning and I still see your face 
I was nearly pure 
When I said I loved you 
You were semi-sincere 
You said I'd bleed for you 
We were kind of candid 
Now you've gone away 
You were almost honest, almost 
Living alone, falling from grace 
I want to atone but there's just empty space 
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back 
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks 
I question your call by the tone of your voice

That in nothing we trust

And if you weren't there

Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass

A life that was born free
To follow orders how to live
Was never meant to be

Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting

The power hits the stage
The music was exciting
The mania raged
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
We all had the fever
Our ears started to ring
Feeding this wildfire
Consuming everything

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

And still is this today
Others imitate or challenge
But it never goes away

Megadeth,"This is breaking news
It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists, firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown
And he is presumed missing

The Vice President, Secretary of State,
And principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at Defcon 3
The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I ""red, white and blew it""
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell
Nuclear battlefields energized
Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting

People lift up your fists in revenge
The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that ""Vietnam thing""
Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang

Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death
This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language, action!
And he respects only one word, force!
No sign of them stopping,
No time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions!
Retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours
Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means
And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them
All along, only another region of hell",Blackmail the Universe

I thought that I knew everything
I could make it in this scene
To be a rising star that only gleamed
But all the answers disagreed
With the questions held for me
I was legal now at twenty-one

I knew the way the world should run

Looked for friends, but I found none

That I was still even half alive
Somehow I managed to survive
I felt my body's doing time
And In my back a hundred knives
From friends at twenty-five

And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell
I'd buy your life, if you would sell
A year or two, if less compelled

Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
Heavily sedated with thousands of round
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
Forty four minutes of target practice
All hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching ""The Force"" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast!!!

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issue guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Es ging uns nur um Spaß an der Mucke
D. hat organisiert und produziert
Wir haben für Jams den Keller bei seinen Eltern okkupiert
Mit dem 8-Spur-Gerät, Mann leg jetzt One Take
Am Mikro, schreib’ lieber gleich so, dass auch was geht
Wenn du’s abliest vom Blatt, en masse Reefer gepafft
Die ganze Zeit gechillt und Lieder gemacht
Vier Mann Crew, drei die gerappt haben
Doch einer nur, bei dem sie gleich so geflasht waren
Und ich bekam Möglichkeiten
Meinen Kragen zu weiten, meinen Namen zu verbreiten
Du konntest dich freuen oder mich dafür beneiden
Doch jeder hat selbst seinen Pfad zu beschreiten
Damals dachten wir, wir schaffen’s zu viert
Hab’ die Texte noch auf englisch fabriziert, aber

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich hätt' es gleich wissen sollen: Es hat nicht gepasst
Sie wollte mehr und ich nur eine Nacht, schon gab’s Krach
Wollt' kein Arschloch sein, wir verstanden uns gut sonst
Also Zweifel runterschlucken, schauen was auf uns zukommt
Wir steigerten uns rein, sie sah Heiraten und Heim
Zweisamkeit, trotzdem gab es Eifersüchteleien
Sie fühlte sich besorgt und ich fühlte mich gestalked
Wir waren eigentlich klüger, doch wütend genügte nicht das Wort
Sie hat mir ein paar gewischt, ich hab’ ihr ein paar gewischt
Ich schlug eine Frau auf der Straße bei Tageslicht
War das ich? An dem Tag ist irgendwas gestorben innen
Mama schau nur das Monster, das ich geworden bin
Will so nicht sein, Hilflosigkeit
Will nur weg, doch sie will, dass ich bleib und ich will nicht
Ich will sie nicht mal ansehen
Doch ich hab’ mir Schuld aufgeladen, also muss ich meinen Mann stehen
Alles wurde schlimmer und als ich endlich die Vernunft hatte
Mich loszumachen, dacht’ ich nur solo für immer
Nie wieder Beziehung, in die ich was investiere
Jetzt hab’ ich ’ne Frau und eine Familie

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich bin einen weiten Weg gekommen seit ich ging
Schau’ zurück und die Dinge bekommen einen Sinn
Die Zukunft ist nicht nur, was ich für mich gestalte
Trotzdem muss ich tun, was ich für richtig halte
Und ich hab’ viele Fehler gemacht in dieser Sache
Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich es mal bis hierhin schaffe
Ein Wunder wie die Seele sich heilt
Wir haben bis unser Weg sich teilt ein Stück des Weges geteilt zusammen
Vielleicht begegnet man sich auf ’ner Kreuzung
Was früher wichtig war, hat heute kaum Bedeutung
Altes stirbt, doch kann zu Erneuerung führen
Wie wenn wir Schmerz erleiden, um dann wieder Freude zu spüren
Auch wenn das Leben rast und sich die Veränderung Zeit lässt
Lerne ich dazu, immer wenn ich denke ich weiß jetzt
Neues erreicht, altes begann das
Nichts bleibt gleich, alles wird anders

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war

Sie wollen so gern nach Amerika, arbeiten aber keine Greencard

Könnt mir noch immer um vier Uhr morgens im Bus begegnen
Sie fragen mich, ob das Bild, das ich ihnen grad mal', zu schwarz ist
Abgeturnt von den Sparauflagen wie Varoufakis
Geld bescheiden, verkehre noch in denselben Kreisen
Moabiter Junge, ich will hier raus und die Welt bereisen
Zeit wartet auf keinen, ich lauf' mein' Träumen nach
Mit jedem neuen Tag kann ich es mir nur selbst beweisen
Streben nach Glück, ich jage, werd' nur vom Warten müde
Morgens im Lager, tagsüber Studio und abends Bühne

Bildersprache sind Pilgerfahrten wie nach Medina
Aus einer Welt, die nicht fabelhaft wie von Amélie war
Nur am Schwitzen, kein faul am Strand sitzen mit Margarita
Versuch' es trotz all der lebenden Zweifel weit zu bringen
Die Welt hat keine Zeit für die Probleme eines Einzelnen
Bau' mich selbst täglich auf, um nicht zu zaudern
Versuch' mit Sound einen Geldregen aus dem Nichts zu zaubern
Sollte vor Jahren schon gleich an' Start gehen, ich wart' noch immer
Alle Songs geschrieben im Zwei-Quadratmeter-Badezimmer
Keine Beschwerden, nur ich und meine Gefährten
Der Weg ist steinig und finster, das Licht muss scheinen im Herzen
Vernichte Zweifel in Werken der Sicht auf eigene Stärken

Alles was ihr seht, ist nicht alles was ich bin
Alles was ihr seht, ist nicht alles was ich bin

Schau zehn Jahre zurück, bald komme ich ins Game
Ich mach’ euch keinen Vorwurf, denn ihr konntet es nicht sehen
Im Wohnzimmer am Tisch und versuche zu erklären
Das hier ist was ich so mach', um mich in Zukunft zu ernähren
Schule ging zwar klar, doch Uni ist nicht meins
Ich träume eher von Welttournee und ’nem Hit auf Eins
Ich allein hab’ diesen Weg gewählt, Mucke machen
Der erste Sohn, das heißt Familiendruck, ich muss es schaffen
Reicht meine Luft noch für die Schlussetappen, fang an zu schuften, Lappen
Schluss mit laschem Genuss beschaffen, spuck im Takt und mach plus in Kassen
Verluste machte ich, die Luft entfachte sich
Natürlich ist dann leicht zu sagen: Guck, es klappt doch nicht
""Du hängst doch nur bei Freunden rum, ihr macht doch nichts
Du könntest alles, werden aber das doch nicht"" zu viele Stimmen
Zu viele Augen für zu vieles blind
Lehnt euch zurück, schaut’ einfach zu wie’s gelingt

Mein Produzent und ich waren entschlossen am Hebel
Musikgeschäft ist gefährlich, es nimmt dir Seele, Herz und Kopf in der Regel
Wir beschlossen, wir stehen geschlossen als Label
Investiert, rentierte sich nicht und wir schlossen das Label
Obwohl die Mucke damals anderen schon gefiel
War ich dann lange ohne Deal, ein gutes Angebot ist Ziel
Aber Plattenfirmen hatten kein Interesse mich zu sellen
Konnten nur Rechnungen erstellen in Exceltabellen
Das ist paar Jahre her, keine Erinnerung ans Datum
Immer nur das Gelaber von Image und Vermarktung
Enttäuschungen sind die Kinder von Erwartung
Mama sagt in jeder Enttäuschung steckt bestimmt noch eine sinnvolle Erfahrung
Doch ich konnte den Segen nicht sehen
Sah sie sich wegdrehen mit ihren Tränen, beten und flehen
Ich wäre fast dem Drang aufzugeben deswegen erlegen
Aber ich hab’ für diesen Scheiß mein halbes Leben gegeben, deswegen

Ich stehe viermal auf, fall’ ich dreimal hin
Ich finde einen Weg, dann macht alles einen Sinn
Alles was ihr seht, ist nicht alles was ich bin
Alles was ihr seht, ist nicht alles was ich bin

Ich wankte lange sei’s drum, ich brachte dem Verstand verdankte Leistung
Wo geht's als nächstes lang, verlangt Entscheidungen
Anweisungen, andere Meinungen
Lange Leitungen, die Unbekannte in der Gleichung
Irgendwann ist die Zeit um, na und - wir bleiben jung
Reisen rum, feiern und die Geier kreisen stumm
Scheinen nehmen einem die Neider meistens krumm
Doch ich scheine bis zur allgemeinen Style-Erweiterung
Man könnte meinen der Stoff bekommt Gema und davon lebt er
Habe trotzdem morgens immer noch den Job im Container
Komme jeden Tag heim schimpfend, nach Schweiß stinkend
Leicht hinkend, für Freizeit keine Zeit findend
Aber stürm’ die Bühne heute hier, sie sagen ""Läuft bei dir""
Yeah, der Grund für diese ganz neue Freude: Ihr
Du, du, sie und er
Wenn ich verzweifel’, schreien sie wir wollen mehr!

Nichts währt für immer, hier um den Moment zu treffen
Such in den Trümmern, um daraus ein Monument zu pressen
Bis mir meine Dämonen aus den Händen fressen
Taste ich mich blind stolpernd durch die engen Wendeltreppen
Mit jedem Atemzug meinen Ahnen näher

Tanz dieses Sprachballett, bis ich sie in ihrem Grab erwecke
Im Spiegel nur der Bruchteil einer Kraterfläche

Die Adlerklauen krallen sich den Schlangenleib
Ein Kampf im Schein des Vollmonds wirft Schatten der Vergangenheit
Verseucht mit tausend Viren, will ich aus dem Asphalt herausflorieren

Hör das Sample knistern, wie der Samen, der im Spliff brennt
Der Komparativ von dicht, Junge, wir sind Dichter
Lass Rauchzeichen aufsteigen, bis es jeder sieht
Mach dir 'n Bild, wenn du willst, ich belicht', dein Negativ

Style macht die Schlagzeilen, Bildzeitungsbefriedigung
Anakin S. kommt und bringt das Equilibrium
Fand das Spiel flach, vielfach Stil schwach
Ich ging ans Schließfach, knackte die Verriegelung

Die Stimmung am Siedepunkt bei Niederkunft unsrer Liederkunst
Fliegt mit uns, Max und Moabiter Jungs
So viel liegt hinter uns, vor uns leuchtet's golden auf
Wo Regen reinigt, kommt die Sonne aus den Wolken raus

Und die Magie passiert unverkrampft, aus Versehen
Im Glauben gehen, nach dem Untergang auferstehen
Sie können nix mehr machen, außer lauter drehen
Hinhören, genau verstehen, vielleicht auch was sehen

Es ist der Lauf des Lebens, das Game bleibt 'n Poker
Zück das Pik As im Ärmel, Cyphers oder Seifenopern
Das Licht muss weiter lodern, Fackeln in der Dunkelheit
Siehst sie wie Stevie flackern, sag sie könn' nur Wunder sein

Leben ist Entschleunigung
Fehler und Läuterung
Erfahrungen formen Überzeugungen
Täuschung und Enttäuschungen
Vorzeichen oder Deutungen
Du entscheidest jeden Tag,
Welche Kreuzung wollen wir heute nehmen

Killer Sonnenbrille, Schiller-Look, wir lieben zu prollen
Fliegen tief, wenn wir liegend in 'nem 7er rollen
Wir haben Spaß, wir genießen in vollen
Spielen Spiele mit 'm Zoll, du sagst das Feeling ist toll
Du bist die mieseste Olle, das heißt, die krasseste Braut

Es ist wichtig, dass du mir in dieser Sache vertraust

Hinterlassen die Räume, als wär 'ne Bombe eingekracht
Schlaf ein, fühl dich sicher und frei, ich mein
Du wachst auf, bist schon mitten dabei
Nimm dir Zeit, es wird heiß wie in Tropencamps

Aber immer hast du mich gestärkt, komm, wir fliegen davon
Du beweist, dass die Sonne noch scheint
Schau uns an, wir entkommen der Zeit, wir fliegen davon
Vielleicht lenkten uns die Ängste bis jetzt
Zusammen sind uns keine Grenzen gesetzt, komm, wir fliegen davon

Doch in dir erkenn' ich mich, wie ich einmal war
Du willst vom Leben lernen und du passt gut auf
Wenn du wirklich etwas willst, ja dann schaffst du's auch

Hast den Drang zu probieren, denn was kann schon passieren

Will ich dich belügen, dann durchschaust du mich mit Leichtigkeit
Denn du kannst hinter die Fassade sehen
Du kannst den Schmerz, kannst die Wunden und die Narben sehen
D-Du kannst alle meine Makel sehen
Und wenn wir uns begegnen, will ich dafür gradestehen
Du bist streng, du kannst mir die Fehler nicht verzeihen
Und auch wenn du bei mir bist, bin ich allein
Doch du lenkst mich oft ab, wenn du wieder kommst
Zeigst mir Seiten von dir, die sieht niemand sonst

Marathonlauf, kein kleiner Sprint

Viel Geholper, so viele Schäden,
Diese Wolken, dieser Regen
Viele Tränen vergebens vergossen
Sie waren dem Leben versprochen
Herzen und Seelen zerbrochen
Hoffen auf den Segen und nehmen den Knochen

Vater unser, dein Wille geschehe, wie im Himmel, so auf Erden
Der Wille zu werden, lass dich von der Angst nicht beherrschen
Die Wut, der Hass, der Neid, die Gier
Sie alle bringen Krankheit im Herzen
Ist Enttäuschung das Ende der Täuschung?
Bedeutet das endlich Erleuchtung?
Oder ist die Zeit, die wir aufbringen, uns zu ändern, Vergeudung?
Der Mensch schon geformt, seit dem Moment seiner Zeugung?

Nix im Magen, viel zu lang am Darben
Keine Klagen, darf nicht versagen
Ohne Ziel zu beginnen ist ein bisschen ohne Sinn
Wollt ich wissen wo ich bin, müsst ich raten
Ich leere meinen Kopf, entferne die Fragen
Augen offen, aber ich schaue nur nach innen
Nur noch konzentriert auf meinen Atem
Ich hör den Beat, leg die Bars hin
Lauf los, immer einen Schritt vor dem Wahnsinn
Spür' den Fahrtwind, gleit' durch die Straßen
Nichts zählt, ich bleibe nicht stehen, bis ich da bin
Schmerz kommt in Phasen, mit der Zeit
Trauer, Wut, Gleichgültigkeit
Ich lauf bis der Geist sich befreit, bis zum Streik in den Waden
Bis sich die Zweifel zerschlagen
Und wenn ich ankomm', schau ich nach oben
Doch der Himmel, ist noch da wo er war

Gedanken, die mich einholen und hetzen
Bilder, die vorbeiziehen in Fetzen, muss mich absetzen
'nen Vorsprung schaffen und Ordnung machen
Im C-H-A-Os, vamos!
Kick's hart wie Roberto Carlos
Ich hustle wie die Jungs in Lagos
Für immer ein Hustler, das Leben ist planlos
Versteh nur Bahnhof, so wie ein Schaffner
Doch ich muss schnell spielen
Ich will hinaus in die Welt ziehen
Wie schnell ich auch lauf, ich kann nicht vor mir selbst fliehen
Ich komm vom Weg ab, Seitenwind
Augen die mich quälen, Tränen, die nicht meine sind
Als kleines Kind schon geprägt von den Ängsten
Einziger Weg ist aufstehen und kämpfen
Krieg nichts geschenkt, ich spreng' Grenzen
Solange ich im Rennen bin
Und wenn ich ankomm', schau ich nach oben
Doch der Himmel ist noch da, wo er war

Ich renn, so als hätt' ich das Stehenbleiben verlernt
Als wär' da 'ne Million nur zehn Meilen entfernt
Hoffentlich bin ich gleich da
Der Weg ist weit, das Ziel scheint unerreichbar
Warum rennen, ich weiß nicht, ich mach's halt
Die Zeit tickt, der Nike trifft den Asphalt
Ich laufe nur der Zeit hinterher
Doch ich kann sie einholen und ein klein bisschen mehr noch
Der Preis, der da winkt als Ansporn
Das gute Leben sehen, ein paar Sitze ganz vorn
Zu dem geilen Film dann die Beine hochlegen
Seh's so real, denke gleich könnt's losgehen
Szenen surreal, schwarz-weiß gezeichnet
Die ganze Strecke in den Grabstein gemeißelt
So lang gerannt, um die Uhr zu entmachten
Nie gestoppt, um in Ruhe zu betrachten

And I'm dying tonight

Megan & Liz,"I heard you were just passing through
I never meant to get attached to you
The day we met, I still hold onto
It was out of the blue
You played a show
And we locked eyes, by the stereo
I fell into your eyes so blue

No matter how it goes, goes, goes
I just want you to know, know, know
I'm reminiscing, thinking about us kissing
Now could you take, take, take the million miles away, way, way?
It's you I'm missing
In this long distance

We keep in touch, though out of reach
I almost wish we didn't meet
It's not enough to keep a romance sweet
I was out of my mind to let you in
I should have thought of you as just a friend
But now you're got me right until the end

No matter how it goes, goes, goes
I just want you to know, know, know
I'm reminiscing, thinking about us kissing
Now could you take, take, take the million miles away, way, way?
It's you I'm missing
In this long

But it makes a good story anyway
All the memories created in one day
I guess they found a place to stay
So we're keeping up with this phone tag
Missing messages and signs that we're not okay
Just pretend you feel the same

That no matter how it goes, goes, goes
I just want you to know, know, know

When you asked me
If you could have my number in your phone
Hoping you would offer your jacket.
You never did that.

One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

Why doesn't anyone stay here?
Why do they leave me?
Don't they realize I'm a porcelain doll
Fragile, helpless, unwanted, breakable

They can't tell that I am sweet
They can't tell I'm like a porcelain doll
Beautiful and demure
But played with one too many times

Why am I not numb to this?
Why can't I let it all outside my mind?
Don't let me sit here collecting dust
But please be careful, please be kind

Why doesn't anyone stay here?
Why do they leave me?
Don't they realize I'm a porcelain doll
Lost, alone, unsure, kind, demure, small
Fragile, helpless, breakable, breakable

I'd mock you
In soft winds
And silent words
I'd spot you
Like snow blushing in the sunlight
And I'd melt you
Like morning into twilight

If I were a mocking bird
Would you chain me
In view of the endless sky world
From the window
Wind reaches, desperate, through the cage bars
To seize me
And I'd die in your arms
But not your heart
If it please you

Fire flies and so do I
I fly high to hide in flight
Why, I delight in blue sky
It's almost like dying

Mocking bird
I'd fly all around
Top of the world
And never come down
From here

If I were a mocking bird
I'd give you feathers
And my very own blood
And other treasures
Which you keep on your dresser at night
In corner darkness
By the candle that you never light
Though it be moonless

Fire flies, so do I
I fly to hide in flight
Why, I delight in blue sky
It's so much, so much like dying

Against the tide
I'd fly all around
With the wind
And never come down
From here

Fire flies, so do I
I fly high to hide in flight
I delight in windy sky
It's almost so much like dying
Fire flies, so do I
I fly high to ride like kites

Megan Slankard,"As I sat the moon started rising
I'm swinging on the rocking chair
It's kinda dark on the horizon
But that's only 'cause the sun ain't there
As I sat the moon started rising
And I remembered like it were yesterday
It was kinda dark beyond the horizon
He had come to take me away

I don't know, I don't know of course
I don't know I don't know why life is so short

As I stood the moon started rounding
She saw him dismounting his horse
In the dark he led himself by starlight
To the porch and from the far lights of the storm
And as she stood the moon started rounding
Her heart started pounding like a fist on the door
From the dark she heard her name that he was saying
And that's what she was waiting for

I don't know, I don't know if it's tame enough there
I don't know, if I go, will I miss it out here

She would go but doubt slowly killed it
Where her love just could not fill it up again
And he just knew he didn't have to ask her
He did not run it past her if this were the end

So she walked here hair flowing behind her
As a gentle reminder that she was only a child
And it was dark but he gently kissed her
He knows he won't forget her with a hint of a smile
And as she cried he cast back a shadow behind him
And it did remind him that there were stars up there too
And it was dark but he gently kissed her
I'm so sorry I could not accompany you

I don't know, I don't know why it just wouldn't be
I don't know I don't know why I couldn't be company
I don't know I don't know
I don't know I don't know
But why couldn't you just stay here with me?

Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

And I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

'Cause I saw him with his new baby
And he treats her like she's the one

It's not that I want him back, ain't trying to be mean

She'll never know that I made him better for her

I gave him swagger, I made him cool
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit
Where it's due, give props to you know who

Give credit where it's due, hey, ooh

He holds her hand at the movies
Never ever stares at other boobies
I bet she thinks he's the one (she does, she does)

She should be thanking me and sending me some flowers
I taught him everything, now he can last for hours
She'll never know that I made him better for her

But I made him all that
What should've you think of my last name
I guess my Trainors' where is at
I had him brushed his teeth, even flossin'
Got him looking like Ryan Gosling
I guess that makes me pretty awesome
But I wasn't in love, so I toss him

The world and all it's capers and how it all will end.
Nothing seems to be lasting, but that isn't our affair.
We've got something permanent,
I mean in the way we care.
It's very clear our love is here to stay.
Not for a year, but ever and a day.
The radio and the telephone.
And the movies that we know.
May just be passing fancies and in time may go.
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay.
Together were going a long, long way.
In time the Rockies may crumble,
Gibraltar may tumble, they're only made of clay.

Mekon,"It was Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I want to be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""

Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights

It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag


Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke

Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""

Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""

Deceive me! Take my doubts away
You have got no choice man. It's the only way

Maybe it's just another paralogism
And my mind fools me now

Holy Mother of God
You've got to go faster than that to get to the top.
Dirtly old mountain
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone
So you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right.

You're halfway up and you're halfway down
And the pack on your back is turning you around.
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember
You don't look back whatever you do.
Better start doing it right.

On your left and on your right
Crosses are green and crosses are blue

Your friends didn't make it through.
Out of the night and out of the dark
Into the fire and into the fight
Well that's the way the heroes go, Ho! Ho! Ho!

Through a crack in Mother Earth,
Blazing hot, the molten rock
Spills out over the land.
And the lava's the lover who licks your boots away, Hey! Hey! Hey!
If you don't want to boil as well,
be	-be	-Better start the dance
D-D-Do you want to dance with me.

The music's playing, the notes are right
Put your left foot first and move into the ight.

And if you're going to cross you better start doing it right

",Sabre Dance
Mekong Delta,"Blind by science, stained by blood
You look down to this global cage
Filled up with misery and pain
(presented as) a coffin for your punishment
While the religion gives the sense
In praying to an imperfect might
Accepting the mutilated
Bodies of little babies
As payment for the luxury of
A so called real and poor church
Somewhere they lost the meaning
Twisted it never seeing
There's no justification
For this runaway creation
Nothing is true and nothing is false
While no one can build or destroy
Worlds in less than seven days
Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules
Reality is insepted by
Reality so all we see is
Created by electron waves
That flow out of a living screen
The truth is portrayted just like a show
Where hate rules all the winners take nothing
While a hypocritical humanity
Sends frozen kisses to a
Tortured people lawn-mowing
The endless mind of
Different thoughts projected
By clean white coats in a
Castle of science no one
Can control and what's more
Nothing is true and nothing is false
While one can build or destroy
Worlds in less than seven days
Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules
Played by men and won by fools

Took back the love you gave to me 

Baby, I was feeling the way I want to feel 
You had me believing the love we had was real 
Things we did together 
You said they'd never end 
Now and till forever 
Oh yeah, that's what you said 
Girl when I was down I knew that you would always be there 
Oh, yeah

Mel Brown,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe
Mel Brown,"Stop, baby can't you see that I can't take it no more 
Stop, if you keep it up I'm gonna go through floor 
Never knew how good love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

Stop, hold it just a minute, ‘cause I got to catch my breath 
Stop, every time you squeeze me you scare my heart half to death 
Thought I was the captain of my ship 
But your love has made me lose my grip 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

I never knew how good a love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me

What you do to me sure must be made of love

You said you would always stay

But still i had to keep on going

I struggled and i prayed
And now i've found my way

And know what you want

And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong

Mel Lewis,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

But I won't be happy

When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

I could live without love

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Just friends, but not like before

Wonderin' how I'd made it through the day

Wild eyed and crazy all burnt out from thinkin'
Wonderin' how the hell I's gonna say

Goodbye marie - oh goodbye Marie
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie
If I cannot keep your love
At least I'll have your memory

Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool

Three weeks of lovin' - 21 nights of heaven
I stayed just long enough to be your fool

Goodbye Marie - oh goodbye Marie
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie

Mel McDaniel,"I left home this morning didn't say a word
The sound of your crying is the only thing I heard
What I had to say you wouldn't wanna hear
So I left you alone with your anger and tears

Anger and tears, anger and tears
Is that all that's left us after loving all these years
As slowly as love grows how soon it disappears
In a house full of anger and a heart full of tears

A face like an angel, a voice like a dove
I knew you were sent her from somewhere up above
Am I to blame for your changing through the years
Have I been the cause of all your anger and tears

Anger and tears, anger and tears
Is that all that's left us after loving all these years
As slowly as love grows how soon it disappears
In a house full of anger and a heart full of tears

I know that sometimes my temper ain't so good
'Cause things haven't worked out the way we thought they would
But let's don't give in to our doubts and our fears
Let's try to put an end to our anger and tears",Anger & Tears

Has somethin' changed? It feels so strange 
Here lately and I'm wonderin' why 
Do you wanna say goodbye?

Mel McDaniel,"I used to be so lonely - I used to be so blue
There was a time I thought I'd never see love shinin' through
I could not find a spark of hope - there was darkness in the air
Then I found someone now the clouds are gone and I see love everywhere.

And I said,""Oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah, I said, ""ooh wee"" then I sighed, -- ""Land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

There was a woman that I heard of - they say every night she cried
About a love that long ago had withered up and died
And then one night she was observed by the full light of the moon
With a swing in her hips and a song on her lips and a man
Up in her room

And she said, ""Oh me, oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah she said, ""Ooh, wee"" then she sighed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere"" 

There was a man that lived next to me and I swear that his heart was hard
There wasn't no sunshine on his back porch and no flowers in his yard
He claimed that he'd looked high and low but love could not be found
But it didn't take much - just a woman's touch to turn his world around.

And he said, ""oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah he said, ""Ooh wee"" then he signed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

Spent the whole night fussin' and a fightin' with your wife?

What you needed was a

One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

A friend of mine was a workin' hard, savin' all his pay
Like Jesse James, the IRS stole most of it away
Then he got chased by a street gang

And he finally found a phone
He called up the police and they put him on hold
What he needed was a

One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

They say, music charms the savage beast and I believe it's true
Man's had it down through' history when he's had the blues
He'd find a drum to beat on and a horn that he could blow

You know it worked for the children of a Israel
At the walls of Jericho
They brought the house down with a

One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Of paradise, where roses grew

We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds

But home is where our hurt is cause love doesn't live there anymore
Yes home is where our hurt is that's why we don't stay at home much anymore

Am I locking someone out or someone in I've got a feeling you're in the house again
Oh I wish I knew what this was all about am I locking someone in or someone out

Her name it's the story that some may like to tell
She may be young and pretty with lips red as wine
A girl whose eyes reflect the years no makeup can't hide
In her world walk the lonely the rejected and condemn
It's a world that once sent her there's no turning back again
Like a rose that lies brushed and crumbled on the sand

Lost unless heaven canceled worthy the same

Mel Tillis,"While walking one day in the country I saw a gathering crowd
And as my footsteps threw me closer I smell a sweet fragrance of flowers
That looked like a family reunion and my eyes not counted the tears
And the no man said by the graveside I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and leave me leave me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary I haven't seen Mary in years

When Mary and I were first married we had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started rambling and like the four winds I just ran wild
If I could just live my life over I would bring Mary such cheers
Now she's gone where she'll never need me I haven't seen Mary in years

Then she tells me somethin' sweet and knocks me off of my feet
And normally Norma thinks of me as just as the swellest guy in the world
Oh but normally Norma loves me
One word led to another over a harmless joke
Then Norma went home to her mother I guess her little heart was broke
Oh oh normally Norma's waitin' on me every evening when the sun goes down

And I never thought the day would come she'd leave me
But for me those kind of thinking days are gone
Cause old faithful ain't faithful anymore she's stepping out to even up the score
She's out there where the lights are bright wining dining every night
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore

I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit

So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich Uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil
Listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps

Dreaming the whole world is in her hands
What she thought was love last night
Was just the wine and the weakness in a man

But now the passion's gone and all that's left
Is cold gray facts and cold gray morning light
As I promptly close the door I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess I should have wakened her
And told her that I must be moving on
But I told myself the truth might hurt her
Worse than waking up to find me gone

But my conscience knows the truth
And it's so hard to convince myself I'm right
And as I slowly drive away
I wonder what did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?
And as I'm driving down the road I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home

I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home.

And my mind goes to another day
And to another woman who might have been my wife
If things hadn't turned out this way

Lord knows I love her but I often wonder
If fate should pull back the blind
How would my wife feel if she could see
The woman in the back of my mind?

Does she do things fancy, does she have a family?
Is she as happy as I?
Does she spend her afternoons just playing bridge
Or baking her children a pie?

And I often wonder if she thinks of me
When she hears those old church bell's chime
Though it's been long ago at times I miss her so
The woman in the back of my mind

Suddenly I come back to right here and now
And the dream that I've seen come to life
And I hope she's as happy with somebody else
As I am with my loving wife

Mel Tormé,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Greensleeves was my heart of gold,

Oh, why did you so enrapture me?
Now I remain in a world apart
But my heart remains in captivity.

I have been ready at your hand,
To grant whatever you would crave,
I have both wagered life and land,
Your love and good-will for to have.

It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity.

And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
but still thou hadst it readily.
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Well, I will pray to God on high,
that thou my constancy mayst see,
And that yet once before I die,
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

To God I pray to prosper thee,
For I am still thy lover true,
Come once again and love me.

London Pride is a flower that's free.

Whoa, Liza, see the coaster barrows,
Vegetable marrows and the fruit piled high.
Whoa, Liza, little London sparrows,
Covent Garden Market where the coasters cry.

Cockney feet mark the beat of history.
Every street pins a memory down.
Nothing ever can quite replace
The grace of London Town.

Growing in the crevices by some London railing,
Though it has a Latin name, in town and countryside
We in England call it London Pride.

See the policeman yawning on his lonely beat.
Gay lady, Mayfair in the morning,
Hear your footsteps echo in the empty street.

Early rain and the pavement's glistening.
All Park Lane in a shimmering gown.
Nothing ever could break or harm
The charm of London Town.

In our city darkened now, street and square and crescent,
We can feel our living past in our shadowed present,
Ghosts beside our starlit Thames who lived and loved and died
Keep throughout the ages London Pride.

London Pride is a flower that's free.
London Pride means our own dear town to us,

Taken so for granted for a thousand years.

With a dude as light as cork,

And some are up in ""G,""

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold

Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Have forgotten half their promises

And I know that I could learn to live

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Always unraveling you, you?

I am anything but middle class

It has a meter that is tricky

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca

Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Mel Tormé,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",You're Driving Me Crazy/Moten Swing

When I awake, I awaken with a tingle

A frosty windowpane shows me a town grown lonely 
That spring of ours that started, so April-hearted 
Seemed made for just a boy and girl

I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my

that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

They bring the flowers that bloom in May
So if it's raining, have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain, you know
(It's raining violets)

And where you see clouds upon the hills
You soon will see crowds of daffodils
So keep on looking for a blue bird
And list'ning for his song
Whenever April showers come along

Mel Tormé,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this, ah

Poor Johnny, one note
Sang out with, ""Gusto""
And just overlorded the place

Poor Johnny, one note
Yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face

For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny, one note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave

He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar

And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

Sing Johnny one note
Sing out with, ""Gusto""
And just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah

So sing Johnny, one note, out loud
Sing Johnny, one note
Sing Johnny, one note out loud",Johnny One Note

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind
Mel Tormé,"I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.

And a smile can hide all the pain

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

And got so far

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Mel Tormé,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Mel Tormé,"Much of my life has been spiced with romance
Too many bedrooms I've slept in by chance
Drownin' out my sorrow
Longin' for tomorrow
Caught up in the big city blues

Rain pourin' down from a cold winter sky
Don't wanna smile and I'm too sad to cry
Clouds hangin' above me
No one there to love me
Guess it's just the big city blues

Someday I'll find me the dream that I'm after
I'll know her with only a glance
She'll make me smile
And she'll fill me with laughter
And our love will be like a dance

Skies will be clear and the sweet sun will shine
I'll hold her near and I'll know that sheÂ´s mine
No more stormy weather
Love will last forever

The dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended, 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own, 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.

I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind

That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone

There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day

Others play at smaller games, being simpler souls.
I am of the latter brand. All I want to do
Is to find a spot of land and live there with you.

On a hilltop high, you and I,
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called

Someday we may be adding
A thing or two, a wing or two.
We will make changes as any family will.
But we will always be called

Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.

is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.

Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.

Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamor and wine.

And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.",When the World Was Young

After high school Zaz seemed cool, he worked on cars, went to bars
But then one day he went away and became a Marine at the age of 18

But he didn't want to fight, didn't do it out of spite
And he didn't want to die, no, he didn't want to die
Then he seemed kind of strange, could it be that he changed?
On that night in the park when he fainted in the dark

Zaz didn't die, lucky guy, there were no parades, how the glory fades

Moved and compelled, at your command

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, and maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You) [Live]

The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't It a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain)

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh, Darling I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for

Mel Tormé,"Each night, just about sunset
I watch you passing my door
It's all I can do
Not to run to you
Cause I don't want to cry anymore

Nighttime, when there is moonlight
The same old moon I knew before
It's all I can do
Not to run to you
Cause I don't want to cry anymore

All that I know about happiness
I found just being with you
Then I would find myself losing my mind
Over some careless thing you would do

Oh, why can't I forget you
I know so well what is in store
A moment or two
Up in the clouds with you
Then back where I was before

No I don't want to cry anymore

Mel Tormé,"I loved you once in silence
And misery was all I knew
Trying so to keep my love from showing
All the while not knowing you loved me too

Yes, loved me in lonesome silence
Your heart filled with dark despair
Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us
As we had known before

The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken
And after all had been said here we are, my love
Silent once more and not far, my love
From where we were before

",I Loved You Once in Silence

Save some fun for tomorrow
Wave a bye, bye to your light
For your light is sleepy too.

For your toys are in bed
Now they're resting and dreaming
Snuggle tight, say goodnight
For it's time you would dreaming too.

Say goodnight to the moon
For it soon will be leaving
Say goodnight to the stars
They are twinkling just for you.

Snuggle tight, say goodnight
For it's time you would dreaming too.

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

To give to this tune so Perry can croon
And maybe old Bing will give it a fling
And that'll start everyone humming this thing

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

Time would come for roll call, time for us to part, 
Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart, 
And there 'neath that far off lantern light, 
I'd hold you tight, we'd kiss ""good-night,""

I heard your feet, but could not meet, 
My Lili of the lamplight,

Resting in a billet just behind the line, 
Even tho'we're parted your lips are close to mine; 
You wait where that lantern softly gleams, 
Your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams, 
My Lili of the lamplight, 
My own Lili Marlene.

When we are marching in the mud and cold, 
And when my pack seems more than I can hold, 
My love for you renews my might, 
I'm warm again, my pack is light,
