Tal Farlow,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Tal Farlow,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea
Tal Farlow,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Tal Farlow,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful
Tal Farlow,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Tal Farlow,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Tal Farlow,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Tal Farlow,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreaming of yesterdays

Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreaming of yesterdays

Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreaming of yesterdays
Yesterdays",Yesterdays
Tal Farlow,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Tal Farlow,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night
Tal Farlow,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark
Tal Farlow,"Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, ""strike up the band""

Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To the martial swing, strike up the band

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
You son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike up the band!

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
Come on, son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, Mr. Leader, 
Hey, Mr. Leader,
Please strike up the band!",Strike up the Band
Tal Farlow,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Tal Farlow,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)
Tal Farlow,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Tal Farlow,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
",When Lights Are Low
Tal Farlow,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You? [Mono Version]
Tal Farlow,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick out of You
Tal Farlow,"This can't be love
Because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love

I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat

This is too sweet to be love
This can't be love
Because I feel so well

I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes
This can't be love
Because I feel so well

No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love
I get no dizzy spells

My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat

This can't be love
Because I feel so well
I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes",This Can't Be Love
Tal Farlow,"Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart

Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Tal Farlow,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There is No Greater Love
Tal Farlow,"If there is someone lovelier than you
Then I am blind, a man without a mind
If there is someone lovelier than you

But no, I'm not blind
My eyes have traveled everywhere
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true",If There's Someone Lovelier Than You
Talas,"Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(think it over) after I've been good to you ?
(think it over) after I've been sweet to you ?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart",Stop! In the Name of Love

You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls

And da ball hit da ground

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Talib Kweli,"These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa

We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much

Talib Kweli,"One, two, three, four
Grimy bitch stomp the bogey outside your front door (yeah)
Puffin on Goodie, eatin tuna and rye
Blow the spot with some old school shit from junior high
One, two, three, four
Jersey's finest in the house, punchlines and metaphors
Make your foul ice grill, thug grimy on the real
Puttin heads to bed like Hennessey and NyQuil

Convertible style, still had the heat knockin
Bumpin shit from way back with my man beatboxin
Shootin the breeze - see I'm nice with these
You'll be suckin it down like fast food high-see's
Type of rap bitch that love underground classics
Gettin more green than that nigga St. Patrick
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set {*dial-up sounds*}
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Cause I be adamant, kill 'em when my joints get added in
Worse than boric acid in your project cabinet
Dirty Harriet, increase the fanbases
Leavin non-writin cats stuck on the plantations
Mini-skirts with tights, eatin lunch with whites
Leave the party over here like they Israelites
Got Cali Brooks critics, Ta' Kwe'(??) Xzibit
Gonna rock shit down like he can't get no visits

One, two, three, four
Rock the whole world like the Rolling Stone tour
Raw your wack set is faker than a bomb threat
By a nervous terrorist who's so scared that his palms wet
One, two, three, four
The stuff legends are made of, urban folklore
Like Jim Morrison we break on through
Before I care about your take on me, we take on you

Yo, yo, yo
We bring it straight to your face from the start, yo
Rage Against the Machine, break it apart
Might be over your head, but it's straight from the heart
I show my love in the light while why'all hate in the dark
Straight to apocalypse is where I'm takin the art
Givin niggaz battle scars, ALWAYS makin my mark
You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

One, two, three, four
Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggaz you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime
I'm an Alkaholik nigga so I finish the fifth
You at the front door bitchin because you ain't on the list

It's like
One, two, three, four",Down For the Count
Talib Kweli,"Yeah
Now here we go
Here we go (come on come on)
Now here we go
Here we go (come on come on)
Yeah

Stay strong this ain't for the faint hearted
My name's honored cause my style is insane retarded
Remain hottest from St. Marks to St. Thomas
Take game farther than the put-put planes charted
The same artist who smoke rainforest and bang hardest
My brain smartest break a nigga like a lame promise
All city like train bombers
Check out the pictures we painted (yeah)
More colorful than Kelis naked
Your skills is least debated and your album least awaited
Even Big Tigger wouldn't let you in ""Tha Basement""
Face it y'all niggas face down with your legs kicking
They call your momma Roy Jones cause she raise chicken
You're ""Down for the Count"" like Rah Digga I'm straight spittin
Make pigeons say, ""Uh uh, no they didn't!""
Yes we did so god bless the kid yo
I got my own so I never stress his no

In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this

In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this

Yo we send this bullet straight towards your brain
We taking over like Moors in Spain there's more to gain
Runaways get aboard the train (come on)
You can't ignore the pain (no)
When it come down like the pouring rain
Caught the Train of Thought it clanked across the raw terrain
The cold weather break your spirit like a water main
I looked in your eyes and I saw the shame
Y'all don't know that our greatness came before the chains
No you can't imagine a future where this all can change
If one of us ain't free then we all to blame
So we attack each other fighting project wars and thang
It's all the same across the board we fall for game
You wanna see through that shit then you can call my name

Since the days of flying a kite and ridin my bike (come on)
Open my eyes and keep the prize within my line of sight (yeah)
Now cats drop out of school to get fiends high on a pipe (word)
Seem like that's the ghetto way of tryin to fight
The system thats based on trying to stop you from shinning your light
We dying in spite of getting rich
That's why I rhyme like a battle emcee
Battling the tragedies and fallacies
That be killing niggas quicker than infant mortality
They acting like whats going on now is distant reality
Behaving so casually that they become a casualty
Plus they don't wanna battle me anyway
They try to walk away but they stumble like Macy Gray
Cats hit the tunnel to rumble and say, ""Hey DJ!""
Make me wonder why they call Sunday the lazy day

Talib Kweli,"These niggas ain't thugs, the real thugs is the government
Don't matter if you independent, democrat or republican
Niggas politickin the street, get into beef
Start blastin, now a new cat is executive chief
With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable
Keep your weight wet, call in collect to save a buck or two
Get mad, who the fuck are you? What you gonna do?
Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine
Forever late to rest on the shrine",Ghetto Afterlife
Talib Kweli,"What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin' you can really prepare for

Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and
My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and
Big L, rock rock on and
Freaky Tah rock rock on and
Jerome Green, rock rock on and

Talib Kweli,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Universal love

Talib Kweli,"Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

Bringing back sweet memories

Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son

Bringing back sweet memories

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)

Bringing back sweet memories

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun
Like wow!
We made it

While I'm stimulatin de brain

Need to disguise and so I cloak
Into a cloud of smoke, I brown a roach
To keep myself from soundin loc'
Destroy they hopes of hatin
Don't move aboard before they rock the boat
Yo it's not the dope
These snakes will come in peace to slit your throat
Give you compliments, with a promise yet

To be rockin shit, shove apocalypse
Down your esophagus so swallow that
Guess what you could be coppin that

And get bumped out the back of impalas and cadillacs

It's amazin' how lickin' shots is the proper representation
Soon they gonna need wack MC reservations
Cause I endanger the motherfuckers, they needin' preservation

It's cool I stay low key, keep a low pro
Come out crushin' shit just for fun like Co Flow

In the procession to your burial
Callin' Hi Tek little Leon the professional
I got the special flow listenin' to estero
Puffin' vegetables and now I'm red to go
The illest rhyme animal like Chuck
Burn leech niggas like salt when i lay in the cut
Think you about to blow when you continue to suck
The shit I've been through
Make me run up in your venue like What!
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd what are y'all waitin' for?
They say nothin' but that fat shit
I got you, say no more i laid the law and all them
Crab rappers played the floor I called them out
A couple of them steeped up and I ate 'em raw
Some more wack niggas tried to spray the door but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in they face with a methaphor
For better or for worse you better call the nurse
Before I send a cleaner and he get to your hospital room first

I have plenty like bein' out of prison
With a roof over my dome
And possessing the gift such as sparking the microphone
Accumulate the provolone makin' it happen with talib
A nattian cat we got em' snappin' roberta flackin' the track and
Killin' em softly with out flossin'
But yet the shine is glossy and
The run the lyrical train through your brain shit
Strategy pain, I'm on some clubber lane shit
With the iron, ain't no use in you trying ""I ain't lyin'""
Through your ears mesmerize em'
It's about time we started risin'
Once again replace bullets with words, try to make it fun again

We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna to shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right

We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right

If the put my life on the screen then its got to be the imax
I live large stroke your mind, till you reach climax
Terrorist hijack on hi tek fly tracks front don't try that
My niggas got my back, you gotta relax, ease back
What's that all about with the feedback?
All up in my mouth we don't need that
Enjoy life open up a tree sack
Take a trip past thought no passport just leave that
The asphalt is the place to be at
Where the people fire burn so bright you can see that believe that
It ain't light music (no)
We make the right music (true)
Keep it tight music (yes)

Yeah I wanna touch you there (right there)
Your mind is my concubine, when I deliver shivers up your spine
Wordsy and that's your soul like the bread and wine
My brain is embedded with rhyme, that's ahead of they time
I rock the better design
You cats ain't got the touch
You all suck, like getting head from a dime
I run up in em and, touch them with the rhythm and
Clutch em' if they tremblin'
It's a rush like adrenaline, at a point break the joint shake
When you play this (yeah), your crew is haters when they come
Through with the newest latest (like that)
Reflection eternal
Shine light bright like the day till the sky turn purple
And the moon arrive, reflection through the night
That touch you just right

With the rhythm, the rhythm, god bless the rhythm
It's the rhythm, rhythm; yes ya'll the rhythm
Shorty on the dance floor giving me rhythm
Hi tek make ya'll nod ya'll neck to the rhythm

Talib Kweli,"We sell, crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through ""epidodes ii,"" like ""attack of the clones""
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like norman mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga core bailed me out
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like bed-stuy through the red sky
With the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some g. rap shit, ""livin' to let die""

This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my highs, and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin, and stop drinkin
And I've been thinkin, I've got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

Just to get (by), just to get (by)

Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by by by by by by)

We keeping it gangster say ""fo shizzle"", ""fo sheezy"" and ""stayin crunk""
Its easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stay drunk
Yo, I activism attackin the system, the blacks and latins in prison
Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The tv got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like john lennon, ""imagine all the people watch""
We rock like paul mccartney from now until the last beatle drop

This morning, I woke up

Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly

When, the people decide, to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs

And hear you speak
We love it!
Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but
One time we were drivin'
Through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road
And he didn't have any, shoes on
He didn't have a, shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man 
But Kweli said, ""Stop the car, beause that brotha, might be in trouble""
And I stopped the car
Kweli said to the man, he said
""Brotha, are you OK? Do you need a ride somewhere?""
And the man looked at Kweli and said
""Shh, I'm escapin'""
And Kweli took him by the hand and said
""My brotha, you didn't get the memo

For some time now""

Talib Kweli,"We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be percieved as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder, asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

We survive, it's more than pride, we stay alive, ready to ride

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
Yo, here we go

I want to write away
I want to write here
I want to write brave words to fight fear
Write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day
But nothing to say
Well I'm way ahead by light years
So beware we keep the lights on
I want to write the songs from right to wrong
Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I want to right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

And the story line goes on
Right to left, who's right who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride
I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and sing my song
I'm passin on the moral y'all
This is ain't play
True, you got to know the way
It's hard now
Open eyes
See hopeful lives
Sing it now

Making my way through life
Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious past what do we have
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle, and became a man

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why

Talib Kweli,"Wooaahh! yeah
On top of the world
Yeah, that's how my seeds got me feeling' right now
On top of the world
Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything, (Yeah)
On top of the world
I'ma hold y'all down for real, (Gotcha!)

It was 1996, fourth of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds,
Seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
Three oh five, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We on the go, yelling at the cabbie, cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Hear come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do see-sections
But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

My baby girl

June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least
That's what the midwife said, on the phone
Anyway, the music got me going away
Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore
Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy,
When they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

I do it for the seeds y'all,
In they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all
I give them the truth,
So they approach the situation, with ammunition
I keep nothing away,
They hear everything, cause they know how to listen
Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow
And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition
They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart,
It's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to them
Unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl,
Everyday they bring joy to my world

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real

They come to me for the lyrical, spiritual, raw shit I spit at you
Original, and I see collective, not individual
Visual, on the mic I'm un-fuck-wit-able
Invincible, official nigga who they come to
For the hardcore, art of war, rhymes that I got in store
Triple W in curo son dot org
For education and culture, heads is waitin' for Mos to
Do the album with Kweli, we do it like we suppose to
Nobody come close to my crew, we wild nice
You ain't tight, your rhymes is like what a child writes
When he can't spell, you chase crumbs and get ate like Han-sel
Can't hold your mic, like your liquor, your style like an Amstel
Smack a nigga til my motherfuckin hands swell
You ain't fly and you prolly guy can't sell
y'all niggas shaky like handheld, amuteur camera work
In walking this planet of earth
I'm the illest emcee and a man of my word
When I came out, niggaz didn't understand it at first
I'm known to roll up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt
We at war and I got a battle plan that can work
With the proper execution so I'm killin' the mic
You get hit like a deer standin' still in the light
I'm spillin' it like, I ain't never had a meal in my life
Feed my family with my pen, it's so real what I write

We fight, fuck, get buckwild
Kill, chill, make love, have child
Freestyle, b-boy, hit the block
Build, destroy, get it hot

Yo, I make the place go apeshit (c'mon)
Ain't no other way to say it, ain't nuttin to play with
I'm Langston Hughes, ""Dreams Deferred"" seen and heard in the flesh
Cause so many people believe the word even when it seems absurd
With keen observation I peep the game
And got blood on his hands, I can see the stains
My street slang spray like shots when heat bang out
Niggas keep my name in they mouth, I put they flame out
Where I'm from, action is first and talk is second
I'm sharp like the blade in the logo of Rawkus Records
New York's infected, niggaz beefin' on the mix-tape
Got Nickelback niggaz thinkin' they can fuck with big weight
Hell no, give it up, it's enough
We about to live it up, with ten of us
We ride and you live with us
Pick it up, party people, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush
You can find Kweli in the cut, wth a Cohiba lit up bout to split a Dutch
Get it up, everybody, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush (woo!)

My rhymes' life support, dog breathe to it
Rhymes are bright, the sunshine beams through it
Stop haters in their tracks like high beams
Like the moment you was at the crime scene screaming ""I ain't do it""
But, I seen through it, it's obscene how I spew it
Martin Luther King had a dream to it, people cling to it
I seen your momma lean to it in a green Buick
Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it
I MC with the truest in the game
I stay hungry like I'm the newest in the game
And stay hot like I'm bluish with the flame
You heard the truth when it came
And you knew it was the name that you couldn't pronounce

Out of respect for the dead we let our Heinekens spill
Cats taking Vicatin pills to numb the pain that they feeling
Pertaining to stealing my rhymes finding their brains on the ceiling
I'm blowing their minds wide open when I'm flowing I'm fine
Hey yo my whole style banging like I'm throwing up signs
Niggas get cut like I saw someone I know in the line
I live life to the fullest cause I know I could die
Right now, I don't believe I know when to sto'
My face soldier's going to lie, when I'm going to buy
You gonna see a rainbow in the sky
And my momma's face glowing with pride
My first born held it down and through my baby's soul I survive
Put your hands in the air and let me know you're alive
I love this game y'all, I ain't even going to lie

Jesus said, ""I am he who supplies all your needs""
And you said, ""I know but tomorrow""

Tomorrow I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, oh but it's so much easier to say, ""Tomorrow""
Who promised you tomorrow? Better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be today

Jesus said, ""Here I stand, won't you please take my hand?""
And you said, ""I will tomorrow""
Jesus said, ""I am he who supplies all your needs""
And you said, ""I know but tomorrow""

Tomorrow I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, oh but it's so much easier to say, ""Tomorrow""
Who promised you tomorrow? Better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be today

And you said, your tomorrow would ever come for you
Still you laughed and played and continued on to say

""Tomorrow, forget about tomorrow""
Won't you give your life today? Oh please, don't just turn and walk away
Tomorrow, tomorrow is not promised, don't let this moment slip away
Your tomorrow could, could very well be here today

Tamia,"Love was the former owner
But quiet is renting our house
It ceases my lips from speaking
But forms a sarcastic smile
Suspense now raised one of your eyebrows
You asked me if there's someone else
I replied, ""yes, hell yes""

You asked if it's another man; I said (no)
You laughed and say, ""Is it a woman?"" I say (yes)
Surprisingly you ask me for her name

And her name is me
And she loves me more than you'll ever know
And I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy, you know if I have to choose, I choose me

And she told me to tell you to never to hurt me again
'Cause if you haven't heard, she's a bad chick
Even though I haven't been
Yet and still you try and test me by raising an angry hand
Put it down, put it down

I'm leaving; don't try and stop me (no)
I'm late, and she is waiting (yes)

Still she stayed

but she would always cry every night
But then he noticed a change 
She no longer had tears on her face

when a woman stops cryin

She has a new plan
She preparing for somethin new something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry 
She's already to say goodbye

when you stay out late
She don't call to ask where you are
(where you at?)
She just gives you this look when you come home that says
You betta watch yo back
Fellas listen to yo girl when she tells you 
That she's all cried out
You'd better pray
That she's stay 

if she no longer crys every night
If she doesn't comlain any more
She's making her way to that front door

when a woman stops cryin
You best believe 
She has a new plan
She preparing for somethin new something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry 
She's already to say

just as long as she is arguin
Fussin & complainin
As long as she will cry sometimes
Everything is all right
Oh but as soon as she is quiet
When you mess up she's silent
And has this certain smile upon her face

locked your love away from me.

you turned and you walked just one way.

you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.

Someone should say, ""he's waiting in quicksand"".

And I don't care, is the face people like to wear
Yes it is now, oh, baby
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Every one single soul's got to do their share
Tell about it, baby, whoo

So come on, let's knock on every door, whoo
Tell them love is the answer
Whether they're rich or poor
Oh, yeah, now, we don't care what you do
How you look, or your status claim, baby
No no, because brothers and sisters
From now on, is gonna be everyone's name, oh-oh, whoo

The world is just a great big onion
And pain and fear are the spices that make you cry
Yes it is, oh, baby
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Is to plant love seeds
Now everybody, got to plant love seeds
Come on and plant love seeds
Until it dies

Tammy Grimes,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I am his forever more",My Man
Tammy Grimes,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Just to wipe my tears away.
You made no demands; chose not to blame,
Though I knew you had the right to.
And I saw the years I wasted;
Searching everywhere in vain.
Finding nothing to believe in,
Until I finally heard you say

Welcome home
My mercy's waiting.
Welcome home
To open arms.
There's no shame in your returning;
Though you may have wondered far,
Welcome home.

That was years ago; so far away,
At an altar on my knees.
But I can still recall, like yesterday
How your love forever changed me.
Oh I see how you've been faithful,
Though I often caused you pain.
And I've learned you won't forsake me

Still standing in His presence like the cactus is

Radiating from award-winning actresses

Available without a cable or a satellite dish

A reconciled generation to the Rock we've missed
