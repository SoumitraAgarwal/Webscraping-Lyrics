Chris Connor,"You give me your lips
And your lips are so heavenly
Stars in the sky are all free
And they shine for me
So does the moon in the blue
All this is mine and heaven too

You give me your arms
And your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ear is the song ev'ry bluebird sings
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day
Each mountain capped with snow
The sentimental tree, the dreamy streams that flow,
Ev'ry country lane and ev'ry street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

You give me your love
And your love is a melody,
Deep in my heart I will carry the song with me
You bring a love so divine
All this is mine and heaven too",All This and Heaven Too
Chris Connor,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.
A cottage for sale.",A Cottage for Sale
Chris Connor,"I could cry salty tears 
Where have I been all these years? 
Little wow, tell me now 
How long has this been goin' on? 

There were chills up my spine 
And some thrills I can't define 
Listen sweet, I repeat 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Oh, I feel that I could melt 
Into heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt 
Finding another world 

Kiss me once, then once more 
What a dunce I was before 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Let me dream that it's true 

Kiss me twice, then once more 
That makes thrice, let's make it four 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Chris Connor,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Chris Connor,"I don't need a million dollars
To make my dreams come true
Baby, all I need is you

I don't need a fortune teller
To tell my troubles to
Baby, all I need is you

Don't need the sun, don't need the stars
For at last I realise
I found the sun, I found the stars
Shining in your eyes

I'm right at the gates of heaven
And I could walk right through
Baby, all I need is you

Baby, all I need is you",All I Need Is You
Chris Connor,"I'm shooting high, got my eye
On a star in the sky, shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell you why shouldn't I?

You know it's you I'm after, you're my lucky star
I'm on a rainbow rafter, climbing up to where you are
I'll have a time, it's a climb but I'll make it
'Cause I'm shooting high

I'm shooting high, got my eye
On a star in the sky, shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell you why shouldn't I?

You know it's you I'm after, you're my lucky star

Chris Connor,"It's a most unusual day
Feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native-born Californian would say
It's a most unusual day

There's a most unusual sky
Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring
It's a most unusual day

There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of Spring in the air

It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way 
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual day

There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of Spring in the air

I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb
Till there is only one thing to say
It's a most, most, most, most, most unusual, most unusual
Most unusual day
Most unusual day",It's a Most Unusual Day
Chris Connor,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me

Chris Connor,"Ev'ry time, ev'ry time, ev'ry doggone time I fall in love
I get a shovin' around ev'ry time
Ev'ry time, ev'ry time, ev'ry doggone time I try romance
I'm takin' a chance on losin' my mind
I'm gonna learn to be a hermit
And live in a hermit's cave
Until I lose those blues my sweetie gave to me

I'm gonna burn my bridges behind me
I'm gonna hate all you men
The love bug will never find me
Way up on the shelf again

'Cause ev'ry time, ev'ry time, ev'ry doggone time I fall in love
I get a shovin' around ev'ry doggone time.",He Was Too Good to Me
Chris Connor,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You
Chris Connor,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young",When the Wind Was Green
Chris Connor,"It begins to tell,
'Round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'Round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
for your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.
Feelin' sad,
really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight
Chris Connor,"Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gainin' no ground
Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

Angel Eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink, and the laugh's, on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.
`Scuse me while I disappear.",Angel Eyes
Chris Connor,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me.
A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall and get that way.
Heigh ho, alas, and also lackaday.
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same.
Was I the moth or flame, I'm all at sea.
It all began so well, but what an end.
This is the time a feller needs a friend.
When every happy plot ends with the marriage knot
And there's no knot for me.",But Not for Me
Chris Connor,"It was just a night like this when it happened
I was such an unsuspecting soul
And I couldn't quite believe when it happened
Till it got beyond control 

When they met, the way they smiled
I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy Moon
What did you do

When they kissed, they tried to say
That it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy Moon
Look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed
To show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love
I guess you think you're smart
Oh, you crazy Moon
You broke my heart

You crazy Moon, you broke my heart","Oh, You Crazy Moon"
Chris Connor,"All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

[Chorus]",Thursday's Child
Chris Connor,"Feeling the way I do, I'd like to say ""I do!""
Heaving a heavenly sigh
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Creeping to bed alone, resting my head alone
Only my pillow nearby
Some have a reason for dreaming
Why can't I?

I feel forsaken on nights like this
Can't I awaken to someone's kiss?

Only my book in bed knows how I look in bed
Nobody hears when I cry
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Feeling the way I do I'd like to say, ""I do!""
Nature is hard to deny
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Feeling the way I do, I'd like to say ""I do!""
Nature is hard to deny
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

If love brings merriment, I must experiment
With some electrical guy
Even old maids find a burglar
Why can't I?

Should girls be good girls?
I think they should
I need a good man to make me be good

Two feet are ever cold
Four feet are never cold
I only mean to imply:
Everybody has someone
Why can't I?

Everybody needs someone
Why can't I?",Why Can't I?
Chris Connor,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart",You Stepped Out of a Dream
Chris Connor,"Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace
Wednesday's child is full of woe
But Thursday's child has far to go

Things look mighty black for Thursday's child
Trouble docks the track of Thursday's child
This world could be a wonderful place
But not when you wear Thursday's face

I never know which way I'm bound, I'm Thursday's child
Heartbreak hangs around for Thursday's child
I'll always be blamed for what I was named
But still I'm not ashamed, I am Thursday's child

Chris Connor,"INTRO
Those happy hours I spent with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

You once filled my heart with no regrets, no fears
Now you find my heart filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know

Chris Connor,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?""",Mixed Emotions
Chris Connor,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe heÃ¢??s a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognise the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe heÃ¢??s a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Chris Connor,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

A barber for a beau would be a social disgrace.

That I'm lonely, and low as can be?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

And every heart is shouting, ""Encore""

Waves are hugging the shore
All the sexes from Maine to Texas
Have never known such love before

See them billing and cooing like the birdies above
Each girl and boy alike sharing joy alike
Feels that passion'll, soon be national
Love is sweeping the country
There never was so much love

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay

Just to get a bird's eye view

To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

And I'm telling you to be one too

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life

No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,

'stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them.

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anyhting goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

So Mrs. R.
With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows

We're broken and we're healed
Give in to what you feel over what you see

Come on moonchild, you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Come on moon flower
You're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour

And when if is only yes and no
And now becomes too soon
I know you'll be alright if you only
Come away to the moon
Come away to the moon
In the blue shine

Come on moonchild, you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Come on moon flower
You're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour",Moonchild
Chris Cornell,"The embers of the saint inside of you
Are growing as I'm bathing in your glow
I'm swallowing the poison of your flower
And hanging on the rising of my low
Colorful and falling from your mouth
Like a painted fever in recoil
Like a lie without the pain

On a pillow of your bones
I will lay across the stones
Of your shore until the tide comes crawling back
Throw my pillow on the fire
Make my bed under the eye
Of your moon until the tide comes crawling back

A waning hand on silver granite ways
Will mend my broken limbs and bend my haze
I'm sleeping in the silence of your voice
I'm cradling the peril of my only choice
Colorful and falling from your mouth
Like a painted fever in recoil
Like a lie without the pain

On a pillow of your bones
I will lay across the stone
Of your shore until the tide comes crawling
Throw my pillow on the fire
Make my bed under the eye
Of your moon until the tide comes crawling back

Even though the truth can burn inside or fall behind
I will wander through your open mind
And you will find no lie can hide
Until the tide comes crawling",Pillow of Your Bones
Chris Cornell,"And so we start another day together
You and I and a million miles between us
I train my moods to bloom like flowers unfolding
Instead of fluttering around
And slowly drowning in the
Steel rain, it's taking over

The sky is open and the drones are pouring out
The day inhales in a contagious yawn
And there you smile as though the sun
Were bouncing in the
Steel rain, it's taking over

Here in our little world, the tiny world spins for me
All's well in the titled world, but there's something
Falling down in the
Steel rain, it's taking over",Steel Rain
Chris Cornell,"Sweet euphoria, mine is the heart you own
You lost the grace of the hands that harmed you
In the daze of a thousand yawns
Lost my love, as it is I'm truly gone
In you morning I will sleep
Fire on an open palm
Death for Jesus and plastic armies
Wouldn't bring me back again
Sweet as ether eyes I'm blind to them

Gone are your dandelions, falling like mine
Falling on land-mine pillows
Tired angels save my love for the lasting one

Sweet euphoria, mine is the heart you stole
Touched and broken are the things you love
Using stars to light your candles
Warms my face, but I can't remember yours
Gone are you dandelions, falling like mine
Falling like daydream mangos
Diving swallows
Save my love for the lasting one",Sweet Euphoria
Chris Cornell,"Words get tangled on your tongue
And you stumble on your feet
When you miss somebody
And everywhere you think you see them
Walking down the street
When you miss somebody
When you miss somebody
You tell yourself a hundred thousand times
Nobody ever lives forever
So you give it one more try
To wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Every hurtful thing you ever said
Is ringing in your ear
When you miss somebody
And everything of beauty that you see
Only brings a tear
When you miss somebody
When you miss somebody
You tell yourself everything will be alright
Try to stand up strong and brave
When all you want to do is lay down and die

How long I've waited for an answer or a sign
Lonely and weary from
The troubled task of trying
To wave goodbye

So now you start to recognize
That every single path you see
Leads to a tear in your eye
So wave goodbye, wave goodbye",Wave Goodbye
Chris Cornell,"What say you now?
The door is opening on your vigil
And I'm in my usual way
I save my breath, knowing what you're
Wanting me to say
I only love you when I'm down
You say that midnight opens its arms to me
Leaving you alone, and I fly so far away
Until the light blurs my vision
And I have nowhere to roam
I only love you when I'm down
And I only love you when I'm down
And I'm only near you when I'm gone
But one thing for you to keep in mind, you know
I'm down all the time

Well I know you're reaching out
And you need to feel my hand
You want to be understood, yeah well I understand
I know you hold precious little hope for me
And in your hapiness
I'm always drowning in my grief
And I only love you when I'm down

Of better days gone by

When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh it's all right

I know all your graces

A feather trail to a better way

Chris Cornell,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She says I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who would dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and her plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice

She told my baby and we danced till three
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she stood right by me
Smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

And tomorrow stands before you
Dressed and draped in a cold black cape
Like a crow he ignores you

Done once again for the marveled crowd

As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails

And the minions are eager to find him
Put a million miles under your heels
And you're still behind him
Cover your clocks with your chains and your locks
While the seasons get hotter and colder

Stretch your faces and lie about your ages
And still you're going to get older

As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail

No bridge I wouldn't cross
Not a moment passes in my life

Anywhere you stand
Anytime you fall
Anywhere you limp
Even if you break
Anytime I can I will be there for you
I know that you'll understand

Now I never would have imagined this
So I thank my lucky stars
As I see you in your wedding dress
Never would have guessed you'd fill my open arms

Kill the center of a man in endless suicide
By the night light, in forever sky

By the mask they wore years before the future
And the horse falls in the smoke filled riot
The center of a child grows in new disguise

And where are words from the sound mouths?

Across the table, where the blood dries

Chris Cornell,"Sleeping on a road that takes you home
Howling at the moon at midnight
I want the wrong that sets you right
I'll be praying at your bedside

How long I've been a soul in the gutter
I don't have a home or mother
Or anywhere to lay my head down

[Chorus:]
Can I visit your arms, can I visit your legs
I won't need your insults or praise
Won't burden your heart
Don't worry your head
If you don't want a soul mate
I'm your soul today

Hanging on a rope from a burning tree
Standing on a broken headstone
Bleeding from an old wound
Swimming in a fever
Waiting for a resurrection
I know it's a miracle I've lived this long
I don't want to give a wrong impression
But I've come so far

[Chorus]

Sleeping on a road that takes you home
Howling at the moon at midnight
I walked along and set you right
I'll be praying at your bedside

How long I've been a soul in the gutter

Can I visit your arms, can I visit your legs
I won't need your insults or praise
Won't burden your heart
Don't worry your head
If you don't want a soul mate

When it all falls down
And the law don't count
And it don't seem fair
And the people don't care

Where in the world you gonna go
Who in the world you gonna hold
When all the world keeps holding on at ground zero
We'll leave it all with God.

When it all falls down
And we almost drown
When the sin sinks in
I guess it's every man for himself

Where in the world you gonna go
Who in the world you gonna hold
When all the world keeps holding on at ground zero
We'll leave it all with God

When the war it rages over the ages
You can't erase it once you spill the
Blood on the concrete river of deceit
Will you be around?

When it all falls down
And the law don't count
And it don't seem fair

Chris Cornell,"Baby
I used to watch your flowers grow
Now it's raining and all your petals turns to stone
I've been praying
I turn around and see my rose
But you faded
You left me now it's time to go

You're like a diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

You need to let me fly alone [Repeat: x3]

I think you've got your timing wrong

Exploring this while we're riding on
And it's crazy to think that I could be reborn
If you saved me
Now it's to late and you'll never know

You're like a diamond and I'm like glass

Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

I can't fly (I can't fly)
I'm gonna need you to save me, angel of mine

And you can say what you want
Turn around every night
So now you're always going off
Doesn't matter what I done
Or if I even crossed the line
Is that the hollar going for blood
Girl, it doesn't have to be a fight

Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?

There's no need to scream, baby
I'm standing right in front of your face
Why?
I know sometimes we don't get along
So Chris sing the second verse to you
Like this

Take a minute to tell you now
Don't have to raise my tone
Take the level and bring it down
I just want you to know
I got no trouble with what you said
I don't even think you're wrong
It's how you say it
You lose your head
Girl I'm standing right in front of you

Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?

I used to think that silence was golden

In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
Alone

On my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I call
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The wine was bled
And there you led me on

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
Alone

And on I read
Until the day was gone

For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged

A pearl inside of every shell

How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
How long when it feels like
We'll live forever I fear
That time will hide the years

Life ain’t nothing if it ain’t hard
It’ll show you who you truly are
Knock you down when you get too tall
Till you spun around in a free fall

But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart

So how hard can it be
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
How long when it feels like
We live for ever i fear

Sleep by the side of the road
And I'm nodding in a stairwell
Just trying to stay out of the cold

Circling around the drain
Can't find my way back to home
The road is long
And never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders

Light breaks in through the window
Takes a minute to know where I am
A dying blackbird
Gives her soul to the wind
On the roof of the house
That I can see from the bed

Circling around the drain
Show me the way back home
The road is long
It never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders

I'd crawl a hundred thousand miles
Just to see your two eyes look me over
I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light
Of the lonely hours on a moonless night

Just like a stray dog in the rain
I can run all night and get nowhere
I picture you out underneath the porch light
Calling my name all night
And waiting for me

I thought I heard your voice in the water
As I walked by a fountain uptown
Now I'm an orphaned at the door of church
Just watching the water come down

Circling around the drain
Hope that I make it home

Dead wishes on a broken chain 
White roses in a dead man's dream 
Down and out with nothing to lose 
If these long dead wishes

Every little drop of blood a kiss that I won't miss

Chris Cosbey,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

 So we went back to my house to change 
 We got there still soaked to the bone 
 Just to find no one was home 
 I said my sister won't care 
 Find you something dry to wear 
 I heard those wet clothes hit the floor 
 Then she came out of that bedroom door

 In little sister's blue jeans 
 Two sizes too small 
 You could hear those threads scream 
 As she came dancin' down the hall 
 She had me comin' apart at the seams 
 In little sister' s blue jeans 
 How that denim hugged those curves 
 I couldn't take my eyes off her 
 She hung her wet clothes on the line 
 I prayed that sun would never shine

 It don't take long for clothes to dry 
 As she went back inside 
 Man she was drivin' me insane

Will never come back for the game has no ending;

""I will leave my land and my horses, on that midnight train I will ride,

To the city, far across the plains,
To that city, on that midnight train, here it comes,
Choo choo choo, on that midnight train,""

And then that lonesome cowboy, stepped into a bar,
A pretty girl slid over nice and easy, ""Boy your money won't go far.""

She took him outside to an alley, he got dragged into a fight,
And a bullet sent him dying, and he cursed that moonless night,

In that city, far across the plains,
In that city, he should hear that midnight train, down the line,
Choo choo choo, he could hear that midnight train,

And now that lonesome cowboy, is lain beneath the clay,

Chris de Burgh,"When the angry sky, opens up its mouth,
And lays down a belt of rain from the north to the south;
Close your windows and close all your doors,
And pray for those men who fall upon rocky shores.

And when the hungry road, points its finger at your heart,
And say ""Stranger follow me, I will show you where to start;""
Well don't make a move, to the left or the right, or them
Hounds are gonna get you, send you running, screaming through
The stormy night.

And one windy night, a flickering light, caught the eye of
A passing angel as she was in flight; she came to the
Door, and there she saw a young soldier crying, as he
lay dying from a wound of war.

Then that angel of the Lord, took the form of a girl,
And knelt by the boy and said ""I will help you to that other world,
Oh rest your weary soul, lay your head upon my shoulder,
Press your trembling hand in mine until the night is over,
For that Devil wants you, but you are a soldier, and with a
Friend by your side there's no need to hide until the fight is over""
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night,
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night.

So if you need help, on a windy night, be sure to leave a
Candle burning so a friend can see the light; there may be a
Stranger come looking for you, and it may be an angel of the
Lord come to bring you better news;

Chris de Burgh,"He was but a traveler on the lonely road of life,
She, her name was Mary, a lady of the night,
She found him lying in that road, on a winter's night so cold,
Just another poor boy, treat him right;

She saw that he was hungry and gave him food to eat,
She knew that he was weary and he had no place to sleep,
She took him home to her own bed, she lay down his wounded head,
And washed away the world from his hands and his feet,

He was just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
When he cried out in his sleep she held him tight,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And she gave him love and comfort through the night,
Till the morning's light

At night she sat beside him, by the fire he would talk,
He said all men were brothers and that love could conquer all,
Many gathered round to hear, many for his life did fear,
In troubled times like these men seldom talked.

Oh they came for him one morning at the breaking of the day,
She woke to hear him calling as they carried him away,
Accusing him of spreading lies and hate,

His public meetings were a danger to the state,
Some soldier said ""Who was he anyway?""

Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And the tears were falling from her face like rain,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And they hung him on a hillside far away,
And on the ground she lay, poor boy, oh my Lord
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord

Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And the tears were falling from her face like rain,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And they hung him on a hillside far away, just another poor boy,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And she never dreamed she'd see his face again",Just Another Poor Boy
Chris de Burgh,"Old friend, so you're in trouble again, you ask me today,
To try and find a little time, and maybe buy a glass of wine,
Old friend, I'm coming through

Old friend, yes I remember you, always a smile on your face,
Oh a memory from years before, an old man and a little boy,
Old friend, I remember you

You used to take me fishing down by the wishing well,
One day you threw a wish in, and we listened while it fell,
And you made a wish

""When the years are heavy, and my heart is growing cold,
Well I wish when the evening comes that there'll always be
Some old friend who'll miss me too""

Well I do, so friend I'm coming through
Yes, for you I'll always find the time, we will have a bottle
Of wine, old friend, I'm here by your side, oh, to the very end,
Old friend, I miss you too, my dear old friend

Chris de Burgh,"I'd like you to meet my last queen,
Over there large as life
She's been hanging there for almost a week,
My poor late wife;

What do think of the color of her skin,
It has the bloom of a rose,
You see she begged me to bring a certain painter in,
And for that picture in her bedroom she would pose;

Well after a while he was driving me mad,
As you could well understand,
Sitting in there, day after day,
With my wife in the palm of his hand
It was 

""Madam please do this and Madam please do that"",
You've never heard such display,
But he didn't mind he was taking his time,
It was me that had to pay,
""Oh Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods,
You understand it's the light"",
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they,
Came back in the middle of the night,
And I swear I'll take care of the painter, oh the painter

Well as you can see it was hard for me,
But something has to be done,
She only has eyes for him and his lies, and as for me,
Not a glance, not a single one;
My orders were severe and she disappeared,
It really was such a shame,
And when they told me she was dead I broke down and said,
""It's that painter, it's him, he's to blame.""

With his ""Madam please do this and Madam please do that"",
You've never heard such display,
But he didn't mind he was taking his time,
It was me that had to pay,
""Oh Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods,
You understand it's the light"",
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they
Came back in the middle of the night,
And I hope it's the rope for the painter,
When he's found, it's hell bound for the painter,
I'll get that painter",The Painter
Chris de Burgh,"This song for you
Hello darling, this is the army,
I've just got the time to write,
Today we attack, there's no turning back,
The boys they're all ready for the fight.

Yes, I'm well but this place is like hell,
They call it Passchendaele,
In nineteen seventeen the war must be ending,
The general said this attack will not fail;

So I'm writing down this simple little melody
When you play it my love, think for me...
We'll be together in this song for you,
And it goes la la la, sing it darling, la la la

They got old bill and the sergeant is still out there
Wounded in some shell hole,
They say this war will end all wars,
Oh God I really hope it will,

Oh how's old England, are they still singing
Those songs that we loved to sing,
When all this is over, we'll go sailing in Dover,
Catching fish like we used to with a string,

Oh I miss you, I miss you, I miss you,
If they get me my love you will know
We'll always be together in this song for you

And it goes la la la, I have to go now
Take care of yourself my love.",The This Song for You
Chris de Burgh,"A great lord came walking through the forest
One morning with a weapon in his hand;
Rich was his castle, he lacked for nothing,
But killing was his plan;
When a white bird flew by she fell from the sky,
Nothing was found, only blood on the ground, she was gone;

Cursing his fortune,
He turned to the forest to kill once again,
And standing before him was a lovely young woman
With her hand hung in pain,
When he saw her his eyes were filled with desire,
He said ""I must have her, she must be mine,
She will be mine""

He offered her silver, he offered her gold,
But she threw it on the ground,
He fell to his knees and he begged her,
""Oh please come with me,
What you wish will be found;""
She said, ""Sire, I'll go if you put up your bow,
And spare these creatures, leave them in peace,
You have no need""

But her words were lost in the wind
His eyes were fixed on a queen
And all he saw was a woman
And all she was, was a dream
Oh oh...And all he saw was a woman, and all she was,
Was a dream

He took her and bound her with ropes tied around her
To his castle he did ride;
In the wood was a bower where stood an an old tower
And he threw her deep inside;
Then the birds left the sky and a terrible cry,
Brought thunder and lightning, and rain falling down,
Tears on the ground

All through the days on her face he would gaze,
For she was lovely as the spring;
No words would she speak but ""Leave them in peace"",
And some sad lament she would sing,
Oh one day by the door, at the window he saw
A single white feather lying on the floor.
She was there no more

Now that great lord is dying,
His cold heart is crying for the love of the girl;
For many an hour he has wept on the tower
For she meant more than the world;
And once in the sky, a white bird flew by,
He lifted his hands, he cried out in pain
""Come back again""

But his words were lost in the wind,
His castle was built upon sand,
And all he has is a memory,
And all he yearns is her hand
Ah ah, all he has is the memory,
And all he yearns is her hand.",The Tower
Chris de Burgh,"Ooh, next time I see you, I'll be singing in Brazil,
Misty land of music where the feet are never still,
And pretty senoritas dressed up for the kill,
They'll be glad that you're coming to Brazil, yeah, me too,
So glad that you're coming to Brazil

Ooh, next thing you know you're out here dancing in the streets,
Working with the people on that Boss-a-Nova beat,
And some dark-eyed lady brings you wine and a chicken wing,
In Brazil where the Carnival is king, yes,
Brazil where the Carnival is king, everybody's singing, 
Ah la la Brazil,

Way, after midnight, and the wine's gone to my head,
Lying here upon the shore just listening to the waves,
And it's been a perfect day.

Packed up a picnic and set off for the sea,
Taking all the back roads where no-one else would be,
My and you and Paul and Sue,
How we laughed the time away,
And we had a perfect day. 
I brought along my old guitar,
And lying there beneath the stars,
We sang all the Beatle songs we knew,
Lord you should have heard those harmonies,
When we did Nowhere Man and Let It Be
My love, if we should break up,
Should we ever part,
And you're searching for some memory,
To help your aching heart,
Forget about the hurtful things,
That lovers often say,
And remember this perfect day. 
Then people start coming around the fire,
And I was strumming at my old guitar,
Trying to think of something everybody knew,
And then you said ""though it's far away,
A Christmas song would really make my day.""
And everybody sang
And all I really want to do,
Is sing songs for you,

Yes it's been a perfect day.",Perfect Day

All I need's a little time to get by,
Turn my face to the wind, hear the nightingale sing,
And wonder at the stars in the sky,

So many things I don't know, so many ways I won't go,
So many secrets that will never be found,
But as long as you're with me with loving to give me,
We can watch the world going round
Ooh, around and around and around and around,
Everything in the world goes around,
Yes around and around and around and around,
And around, everything goes around
From the moment of birth till you go back to the earth,
Your life is like a circle of gold,
And everything you begin, every song that you sing,
Sooner or later must go

Another time, another place, another life, another face,
Oh my love I know I'll see you again,
And the circle that starts with the beat of your heart,
Takes you back to the beginning again
Oh around and around

Dreaming of the days when he was young,
Hand in hand, a little boy beside him,
Hearing about the weekends under the sun
""Ah most of all I remember,
A little song we used to play,
It was about the English weather,
Always raining on a sunny day, and it went

Ah la la la, summer rain is pouring down again,
And it's getting wetter,
As a matter of fact it couldn't be better,
For baby and me, sitting on my knees, (with baby on my knee)
Ah la la la, summer rain is falling down,
On my umbrella above me,
The very first time she said she loved me,
Was in the summer rain, and it's fine with me
Walking with your great-grandfather's daughter,
Somehow we were always late for tea,
And small boys making mischief in the water,
Watching deck-chairs floating away out to sea, 
Ah but now the memory's fading,
How the past just slips away,
But every time that it starts raining,
I can hear the band begin to play,

Chris de Burgh,"There is an answer, some day we will know,
And you will ask her, why she had to go,
We live and die, we laugh and we cry,
And you must take away the pain,
Before you can begin to live again

Let the tears come rolling from your heart,
And when you need a light in the lonely nights,
Carry me like a fire in your heart,

You will be with her for all eternity,
But we that remain need you here again,
So hold her in your memory,
And begin to make the shadows disappear;

For his world was still covered in snow,
But the spring had not been, for he was wicked and mean,
In his winter-fields nothing would grow;
And when a traveler called seeking help at the door,
Only food and a bed for the night,
He ordered his slave to turn her away,
The girl with April in her eyes
Oh, on and on she goes,
Through the winter's night, the wild wind and the snow,
Hi, on and on she rides,
Someone help the girl with April in her eyes

Of a humble man's home in the woods,
He brought her inside, by the firelight she died,
And he buried her gently and good;
Oh the morning was bright, all the world was snow-white,
But when he came to the place where she lay,
His field was ablaze with flowers on the grave,
Of the girl with April in her eyes

Just in time, oh they'll live another day;

Or the Earth will roar like a wounded beast,
The mountains will come crashing from the valleys to the sea,
Just in time, oh don't throw it all away,
Just in time, don't throw it all away

Will you save it just in time?""

And now you're asking me why love can wither away and die,
Well I know, I know that some things go, but some things never change, 
Like the starlight, that is shining in your eyes,
Like the storm in a winter sky,
Like the moon on the tide,
Turning it again and again,
Like the way that I love you,
Some things never change,
Like the way that I love you,
Some things never change; 
The road is long and it's hard, I don't imagine for a minute it's not,
But I'll keep my loving for you, right down to the end,
The fire is blazing bright, we could sit here and talk all night,
And though this wood must burn away, some things never change, 
Like the starlight, that is shining in your eyes,
Like the storm in a winter sky,
Like the moon on the tide,
Turning it again and again,

Some things never change;

Everything you want to get through,
I won't let you down; 
But what's this talk of leaving, what's it all about?
We're sitting here this evening, trying to sort it out;
You say that I never listen, that I just don't seem to care,
What happens in your world, and I'm hardly ever there;

Well tonight, I'll give you every bit of my heart, 
Give you everything that I've got,
I don't want to lose you,

I want to get it right,

Chris de Burgh,"Down in the jungle, you can hear a rumble,
Way up the Himalayas, in a Mexican bodega,
Something is going on,
People are coming, running round the world,
There's no way to avoid them, they're everywhere,
You can see them on the streets of London town; 
They've found a tourist attraction,
It's a bobby on the beat,
Yes a tourist attraction,
They're all looking at his feet,
And the blue rinse ladies,
Shooting cameras from the hip,
Doing Europe in two days,
""We've had a wonderful trip!""
And he turns to the Palace,
You can almost hear him say,
""Your Majesty why don't you tell them,
Please go away!""
Tourist attraction, tourist attraction, tourist attraction; 
Caribbean island, cool drink in my hand,
Nearest thing to Paradise, the native girls are very nice;
Something is going wrong,
People are coming, running down the beach,
Cameras at the ready, get out of reach,
Time to grab my things, I'm heading for the hills; 
They've found a tourist attraction,
Yes my little hideaway,
It's a tourist attraction, it will never be the same,
There's a big bus driver taking money on the side,
""Everybody stick together and please follow the guide,""
And way over yonder, they hear somebody yell,
""I came here for the peace and quiet, y'all go to hell!""

Chris de Burgh,"Hollywood is such a dream,
And when you're only seventeen, it's wonderful,
A movie man said she could be a star,
A beauty queen, or a cover girl,
She believes and packs up her things,
And the wall of silence begins;

Every night was party night,
She was everyone's delight, he let her stay,
And when he'd had enough, he threw her out,
And she found work in a small cafe,
When she called they put her on hold,
And the wall of silence grows; 
Give me a break,
Give me a break,
This is Hollywood,
Open the door,
Open the door,
What am I going to do,
When the money runs out,
And there isn't any doubt,
That I'll have nowhere to go. 
Hollywood is just a dream,
But when you're only seventeen, it's magical,

I'm lost, and out at sea,
I thought these wings would hold me forever,
And on to eternity,
And far away I can hear your voice,
I can hear it in the silence of the morning,
But these broken wings have let me down,
They can't even carry me home.

In broken dreams that keep me from sleeping,
I remember all the things I said,
Well I've broken all the promises,
I said I would be keeping,
They're gone, like leaves they fell,
For it's so hard when you're far away,
All I needed was a shoulder I could cry on,
Now these broken dreams have woken me,
My love, will you carry me home. 
Or will you treat me like some traveler,
On a dark and lonely road,
Who sees a light and a woman who will give him love,
Oh and just when she reaches the part,
When she's supposed to comfort his broken heart,
She turns away, and sends him traveling on, on, 
Oh when I left I believed that nothing would go wrong,
I thought the whole world would be waiting for my story,
Take me back, my love, I need you now,

They say there will be rain tonight,
But that's okay, we'll stay inside,
This is the first time I have felt so satisfied,
I know love has found me;

And now the night, is getting wild,
And she is sleeping like a child,
And though I know, I know I should be dreaming,
I'm tossing and turning, 'cause I wonder,

Yes I wonder, how it began,
Growing in the forests and the freeways,
Minute by minute she became a part of me,
And suddenly love is here and I'm falling,

Just like every drop of rain,
Many drops can someday make a river,
And many rivers go down to the sea,
And the sea rolls on forever, forever;

And now I'll sleep till morning light,
I have no fear of stormy nights,
Because the one that I have wanted all my life,
Is right here beside me, and I wonder,

Oh the wonder, how it began,

Chris de Burgh,"In a country churchyard there's a preacher with his people,
Gathered all around to join a man and woman,
Spring is here and turtledoves are singing from the steeple,
Bees are in the flowers, growing in the graveyard,
And over the hill, where the river meets the mill,
A lovely girl is coming down,
To give her hand upon her wedding day

Dressed in simple white and wearing flowers in her hair,
Music as she walks slowly to the altar,
And picking up his bible then the preacher turns towards her,
""Will you take this man to be your wedded husband,
To honor and love in the eyes of God above,
Now let the people sing with me,
These words to live forever in your heart
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,
Until the day you fly away"" 
Many years have fallen on that golden country morning,
The graveyard's overgrown, the church lies in ruins,
Ivy on the walls and ravens wheeling round above me,
As I made my way towards the last remaining headstone,
I fell to my knees, read the lines beneath the leaves,
And suddenly it seemed to me,
I heard the words like singing in the trees
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,
Until the day you fly
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,

Chris de Burgh,"The cold north wind they call ""La Bise""
Is swirling round about my knees,
Trees are crying leaves into the river;

I'm huddled in this french cafe
I never thought I'd see the day,
But winter's here and summer's really over, 
Even the birds have packed up and gone,
They're flying south with their song,
And my love, she too has gone, she had to fly, 
Take care, it's such a lonely sky,
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky

The old cathedral lights are low
She and I we'd often go there
To admire and sometimes kneel in prayer;

Lords and ladies lie in stone,
Hand in hand from long ago,
And though their hands are cold they'll love forever, 
Even the choir rehearses those songs
For Christmas is not long,
And alone, I sing my song, she had to fly, 
Out there it's such a lonely sky,
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
Fly away, fly to me, and if you need my love,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky
I'll come in with the dawn,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
On the wings of the morn,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,

And beseeching me to come and keep the score
And Maud saya ""Oh Lord! I'm so terribly bored!""
I really can't stand it anymore

I'm going out to dinner, with a gorgeous singer,
To a little place I've found down by the quay;
Her name is Patricia, she calls herself Delicia,
And the reason isn't very hard to see

She says God made her a sinner just to keep fat men thinner,
As they tumble down in heaps before her feet.
They hang around in groups like battle-weary troops,
One can often see them queue right down the street
You see Patricia, or Delicia, not only is a singer
She also removes all her clothing
For Patricia is the best stripper in town, 
And with a swing of her hips she started to strip,
To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
And with a lick of her lips she undid all the clips,
Threw it all in the air, and everyone stared,
And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
The police were banging on the door,
On a Saturday night, in nineteen twenty-four
Take it away boys!
But poor Patricia was arrested and everyone detested,
The manner in which she was exposed,
And later on in court, well, everybody thought
A summer run in jail would be proposed,

But the judge said, ""Patricia,
Or may I say, Delicia,
The facts of this case lie before me...
Case dismissed, this girl was in her working clothes!!""

And with a swing of her hips, she started to strip,
To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
And with a lick of her lips she undid all her clips,
Threw it all in the air, and everyone stared,
And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
The police were yelling out for more!!!

Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

And I would hold you in my arms for the rest of my days.

When you're sad and feeling low, you're on your own with nowhere to go,
Make believe that she is gone, play your guitar and write a song for her,
Write down the words about how you cried when you woke up weeping,
'cause you thought that she had died, and you heard her breathing,
Through your pain and you held her close and cried all over again,
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

And inside my lovely house with satin green shutters, there would be children,
The most lovely children in the world

Chris de Burgh,"A spaceman came traveling on his ship from afar
'Twas light years of time since his mission did start
And over a village, he halted his craft
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star

He followed a light and came down to a shed
Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed
A bright light of silver shone round his head
And he had the face of an angel and they were afraid

Then the stranger spoke, he said, do not fear
I come from a planet a long way from here
And I bring a message for mankind to hear

Chris de Burgh,"Restless hearts, it has been a long time,
Out here on the journey, for a glimpse of paradise,
It's getting hard to find a place to go,
Where peaceful waters flow;

I took a walk past the old Saxon well,
Down by the cathedral, I heard the chapel bell,
And joined the people singing for a way to go,
Where peaceful waters flow;

And if you don't know by now, you never will,
Only love can find the door,
If you could see it now, it's in your hands,
Only love can reach the shore, to heaven,

Always, she is standing by my side,
She's my inspiration, and she's my battle cry,
And in her arms is the only place I know,
Where peaceful waters flow; 
And if you don't know by now, you never will,
Only love can find the door,
If you could see it now, it's in your hands,
Only love can reach the shore, forevermore,
Where peaceful waters flow",Where Peaceful Waters Flow
Chris de Burgh,"Come to my door, meet me at midnight,
I can't wait anymore, and after midnight,
We must head for the town,
Keep under cover till dawn,
With a bagful of wine;

The night is alive, look in the shadows,
Because now is the time, out in the shadows,
To be somebody else, complete transformation,
From the someone we are in the day;

I hear a noise, there is something going on,
I hear a voice, there is something going on,
I see the boys, there is something going on,
And something is happening to me, yea;

I love the night, I love the night,
I love the element of danger and the ecstasy of flight,
I love the night, I love the night,
I love to dance with a stranger and to feel her delight,
And when the dancing is through, I kick off my shoes,
And I listen to the beating of my heart

After the fall, then came the hunger,
In the hearts of us all, ooh such a hunger,
That begins after dark, hides in the heart,
Like a wolf that is waiting inside;

I see a light, there is something going on,
It's getting bright, there is something going on,
I look outside, there is something going on,
And someone is calling to me;

I love the night, I love the night,
I love the element of danger and the ecstasy of flight,
I love the night, I love the night,
I love to be with a stranger and to feel her delight,
And when the morning begins, I have to get in,

Let the rain fall on the window pane,
And fill the castle keep,
I am weary now, weary to my bones,
Weary from the traveling,
And the endless country roads,
That brought us here tonight, for this weekend,
And a chance to work it out,
For we cannot live together, and we cannot live apart,
It's the classical dilemma between the head and the heart;

She is sleeping now, softly in the night,
And in my heart of darkness she has been the only light,
I am lost in love, looking at her face,
And still I hear the voice of reason,
Telling me to chase these dreams away,
Oh here we go again, we're divided from the start,
For we cannot live together, and we cannot live apart,
It's the classical dilemma between the head and the heart,
The head and the heart;

Now the dawn begins, and still I cannot sleep,
My head is spinning round but now the way is clear to me,
There is nothing left, nothing left to show,
The jury and the judge will see, it's time to let her go,
Now hear the heart,
I believe that time will show,
She will always be a part of my world,
I don't want to see her go,
So I plead my case to hear the heart,
And stay

It's time to let her go, I don't want to let her go
It's time to let her go, I don't want to let her go
It's time to let her go, I don't want to let her go

Hey comrade, a drink, make it a long one,

My head is aching and the bar's going round,
And I'm so down, in this foreign town;

Tonight there's a band, it ain't such a bad one,
Play me a song, don't make it a sad one,
I can't even talk to these Russian girls,

Chris de Burgh,"Sometimes the man in me gets restless,
I need to get away from you,
And spend some time with someone that I knew,
Just to see her for a night,
And in the candlelight,
To talk and remember early days;

Sometimes the woman in you's uneasy,
I can see it in your eyes,
Just like me you need to know,
Can you still fly,
Can you still arouse the passions,
Of another man,
And if you carry it through, what would I do?

It would take much more than this,
To break a love so long in the making,
It would take much more than talk or dreams,
To shake so strong a foundation, more than this;

Sometimes the man in me gets lonely,
When I am away from you,
And in the darkness of another hotel room,
If there's someone in the night saying,
""It's gonna be alright to ease away the pain of missing you,
What can I do?""

Dressed in silver and dressed in white,

Don't they know it's against the law,
Well it must have been before the war,
Long before; it was

Real love and devotion, with sight and touch,
Real love and emotion, with sight and touch,
Real love and devotion, before the modern world;

With his balaclava eyes, is making the news,

Playing late at night on radio,

Watching seabirds as they fly,
On a summer day, on a summer day;

And now the sun is here to stay,
The winter seems so far away,
In the summertime, in the summertime;

Sitting here with my love tonight,
News is breaking from the south,
On the radio, on the radio;

Brother lead and sister steel,
Are playing out their final scene,
On the radio, on the radio;

And when you lie beside me soft and quiet in the night,
I often listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat giving life,
You are so precious to me darling, it will always be that way,
Until the final act is over,
Until every man has spoken,
Until every battle's done,
Until the day,
Transmission ends, transmission ends;

Waiting up for a show tonight,
Coming in via satellite,
From America, from America;

Whispers from some far-off place,
Are drifting into outer space,
From America, from America;

And when I see a shooting star go flashing in the night,
I often wonder if some other beings also see the light,
And are they picking up our signals,
As they spin of into space,
Until the final act is over,
Until every man has spoken,
Until every summer's gone,
Until every battle's done,
Until the day,
Transmission ends, transmission ends;

Oh don't let it happen, don't let it happen, no, no,
Darling, I'm always going to love you,
Yes I'm always going to love you,
Darling, I'm always going to love you,

Until the final hour,
I'm always going to be with you,
Yes I'm always going to be with you,

Chris de Burgh,"In the ballroom of romance, there's a rock band playing,
People swaying to the beat, swaying in the heat,
In the corner over there by the door is a local Casanova,
Yelling for another double scotch, ""hey, steady on the rocks!""
And when the girl walked in, a complete unknown,
There was mass confusion, this beauty was alone,
And then the room began to shimmer,
Every heart was beating fast,
Every man who had to win her,
Was moving fast, they said

I'm ready for romance is here at last;

In the ballroom of romance, there's a young man waiting,
Standing looking over at the scene, it could be you or me,
Every eye in the room was watching as she walked over to him,
Whispered ""do you want to come with me, I'm heading for the beach,""
In her BMW 635, going smooth at ninety, feeling good to be alive,
And then the moon began to shimmer,
Hey the sea was roaring in,
Just one kiss and then his heart,
Began to sing, he said

And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said now I've found you
I'm never letting go

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologize
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is going to feel it too
So there's only one thing to do, tell you that

I've been missing you, more than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you, I'm never letting go
No, now I've found you, I'm never letting go

I've been missing you, I've been missing you
I've been missing you, I've been missing you, darling",Missing You
Chris de Burgh,"Naked and frozen at the side of a lake,
I think I've gone and made my big mistake,
I took her swimming, we had a fight,
Now my clothes and the lady are well out of sight;

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

Naked and frozen at the side of a lake,
If she was here I wouldn't hesitate,
To tell her how, the way things are,
With a long conversation in the back of a car;

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,
Just me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

I think she owes me an explanation,
She's got the whip hand in this situation,
If I try to tell her just the way I feel,
It could start the whole thing all over again;

Oh, I think I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,
But I see the lights of a car, shining in the dark,

Oh, could be we're heading for a mm-mm,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be we're heading for a mm-mm,
Just you and me and our beating hearts,
We're singing in the dark.",A Night on the River

Watching all the ships 
As they are heading for the harbor wall

Reading out the names 
Of all the places I have never been
Looking out to sea, staring out to sea

Sailing away, with you tonight, with you tonight

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, there's no turning back,
And a journey has just begun;

There is singing inside,
And all of the light that's in your eyes, shining here tonight,
Has woken the man in me, and the woman in you,
The woman in you;

All night, heads on the pillow, and eyes that are never shut,
All night, rain on the window, but inside, we have so much;

Suddenly love takes me away where I've never been,
Shows me a world I have never seen, I could only dream,
That I ever would find myself with a lover like you,
A lover like you;

All night, heads on the pillow, and eyes that are never shut,
All night, body to body, and thrilling to every touch;

Chris de Burgh,"Oh how, at the journey's end, I lie in the heat of the night,

When I say, that I need

Tender hands to hold me, I need tender hands tonight,
Will you lay them on my shoulders,
Will you lay them on my eyes,
And I need tender hands to take me,
All the way to paradise, and then, when it's over,
I need tender hands to hold me through the night;

Touch me with your velvet mouth, I will give all the love that I have,
Under the moonlight, reaching your heart,
Where are you now, where are you now, come out of the shadows,
Where are you now, I want you now,
You know that I cannot always be strong, and I need

I see the storm grow, there's a light in the desert tonight;

And I need tender hands, give me tender hands,
Will you lay them on my shoulders, oh give me,
Tender hands to take me all the way to paradise,

Is it love that's making me weak, in the night,
And when she's next to me,
I just stumble on my words,
And all the things I want to say,
Come out wrong,
I am lost in a dream,
But I know this is more than it seems,
I need a little help;

Someone put on a love song,
To bring her closer to me,
All I want is this diamond in the dark,
To begin what must be;

When she turns at her name, when she smiles,
When she smiles, I feel it again, in my heart,
Across the crowded room,
She is just a dance away,
And I can feel her like a fire that's burning strong,
She keeps looking at me,
And I know this was all meant to be,
And then it had to come;

I am waiting for a train
To take me to the border
And my loved one far away
I watched a bunch of soldiers heading for the war
I could hardly even bear to see them go

Rolling through the countryside
Tears are in my eyes
We're coming to the borderline
I'm ready with my lies
And in the early morning rain, I see her there
And I know I'll have to say goodbye again

And it's breaking my heart, I know what I must do

And there's the boat on the river

And then the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered and  a moaned
On the water

There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now (don't do it)

And I know that I have let her slip away
(Fatal hesitation aah, fatal hesitation aah)

I saw you again this morning, walking down the beach
And though you are a thousand miles away
You were only just out of reach, but when I got up close

It was raining all night long
We were lucky and we saw no enemy
And came from Switzerland, poor refugees
Far from the guns of war
We said goodbye to it all

They brought us into a nurse's station
Half a mile behind the lines
Oh Lord, how my heart was breaking
To see the children, and the walking wounded
Hoping for a ticket home
And say goodbye to it all

I woke up on a cold blue morning

And I have a job in the old hotel

Chris de Burgh,"There's a Spanish train that runs between
Guadalquivir and old Saville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people hear she's running still

And then they hush their children back to sleep
Lock the doors, upstairs they creep
For it is said that the souls of the dead
Fill that train ten thousand deep

Well a railwayman lay dying with his people by his side
His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died
But above his bed just a waiting for the dead
Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye
Well God's not around and look what I've found, this one's mine

Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light
And shouted at the Devil, get thee hence to endless night
But the Devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
But there's no need to push me around
I got him first so you can do your worst
He's going underground

But I think I'll give you one more chance
Said the Devil with a smile
So throw away that stupid lance
It's really not your style
Joker is the name, poker is the game
We'll play right here on this bed
And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet
The souls of the dead

And I said look out, Lord, He's going to win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, He's going to win

Well the railwayman he cut the cards
And he dealt them each a hand of five
And for the Lord, he was praying hard
Or that train he'd have to drive
Well the Devil he had three aces and a king
And the Lord, he was running for a straight
He had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades
All he needed was the eight

And then the Lord he called for one more card
But he drew the diamond eight
And the Devil said to the son of God
I believe you've got it straight
So deal me one for the time has come
To see who'll be the king of this place
But as he spoke, from beneath his cloak
He slipped another ace

Ten thousand souls was the opening bid
And it soon went up to fifty nine
But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did
And he said that suits me fine
I'll raise you high to a hundred and five
And forever put an end to your sins
But the Devil let out a mighty shout, my hand wins

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you let him win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, don't let him win

Well that Spanish train still runs between
Guadalquivir and old Saville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people fear she's running still

And far away in some recess
The Lord and the Devil are now playing chess
The Devil still cheats and wins more souls
And as for the Lord, well, he's just doing his best

Chris de Burgh,"I was walking down that road, to the place that was my home,
And the memories of a life go on forever,
Here's the village, here's the sea and here's the place where it began,
When I found myself in the arms of Lady Madonna,
And then I listen for those footsteps, coming down the hall,
A father to his young boy, who was hurting from a fall,
You must have heard me crying, you must have dried my tears,
But you know, I just can't remember, just can't remember,
The son and the father, the son and the father;

Now I'm walking with my boy through the place that is our home,
And the memories of his life are growing forever,
And I'm looking through his eyes at all the wonders of the world,
Then hand in hand we will make this journey together;
And we will talk of men and pirates, and heroes in the dark,
I will tell him of the hungers and the mysteries of the heart,
And I will always hear you crying, I will always dry your tears;

And I pray you'll always remember, always forever

Chris de Burgh,"It's the way that you move, it's the way that you smile,

It's the promise of you in the heat of the night,
When you open your door, it's the way that you bring me inside;

I can honestly say I have never before,
Had a feeling so good in my heart,
I can honestly say that I know it for sure,
This is love, this is love, this is love,

And I'm in your world;
It's the rhythm of you with your hips on my hips,
It's the things that you do with your mouth and your lips,
The caress of your hair, and your sensual kiss,

It's the way that we share in the moment that goes on forever;
When we finally fall from this heaven I feel,
I am lost in the light of your heart,
Oh sweet angel, it's shining for you and for me,

We sit and talk about it all,
And out in the distance, a dream is over,
All I've been working for;

This is not how I want you to see me,
I have done the best I can,
Now the only thing I believe in,
Is a woman and a man;

You are the reason I'll stay in the fight,
When I can't take it anymore,
You are the reason I wake in the night,
And say that I was only dreaming of it all;

And now in the dawn light, she talks with me again,
Remember all the things we've done,
Been through the bad times, and we've seen through the sad times,
We're stronger than before;

And you picked me up when I was falling,
And you gave me back my pride,
And you listen when I am calling,

Chris de Burgh,"Last night I was walking through the harbor,
Where the fishing boats are lying on the shore,
The news had traveled fast and everyone went to be,
Where the mayor was making a speech,
And the crowd started cheering,
When he talked about the glory of it all,
And the boys coming home from the war;

Last night, they were dancing in the streets,
And making music in the alleyways and bars,
From a house down in the old town came the sound of guitars,
Margarita was waiting inside,
With her long black hair hanging down beneath the red light,
And she smiled, for the boys coming home from the war,
The boys coming home from the war;

And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
And we said ""nothing will make us change in any way,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,
Since yesterday, nothing has changed,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,""
But I can feel there's a new kind of hunger inside,
To be satisfied, I saw it there last night;

Last night I was walking through the shadows,
Far away from all the music and the girls,
When I saw a soldier waiting with a woman in black,
And they stood without any word,
Just staring at a photograph of someone, and she began to cry,
For a boy left behind in the war,
Some boy left behind in the war;

And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
And we said ""nothing will make us change in any way,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,
Since yesterday, nothing has changed,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,""

To be satisfied, I saw it there last night",Last Night
Chris de Burgh,"The last time I cried, I was sitting home,
And it was deep in the night,
Staring at the shadows and the flickering lights,
Giving all that I had, to take them away,
Giving all that I had, to make them pay;

The last time I cried, I could see the people,
Long ago in the rain,
Waiting as the soldiers put them all on a train,
And the hands on the bars, the eyes full of tears,
And the word is the same, for a thousand years,

Eli Eli Lama, oh Lord, you have forsaken me,
Eli Eli Lama, oh Lord, you have forsaken me;

The last time I cried, I could not believe it,
When I held on a face,
Staring at a soldier with his gun in the rain,
It was the face of a child, my child here asleep,
And the soldier who smiled, the man was me,

Eli Eli Lama, oh Lord, you have forsaken me,
Eli Eli Lama, oh why, have you forsaken me?

I can hear someone knocking on the door,
There are voices in the street,
And the sound of running feet,
And they whisper the word ""Revolution!""

There are men coming down from the valleys,
There are tall ships lying off the coast,
And they carry the light,
In the dark of the night,
Like a whisper in the wind ""Revolution!""

By the sea we will gather for the fight,

And give me a drink of wine,

Of the risen Lord;

On a night like this there came,
A stranger on the road,

On a long hot summer's day.
To watch that girl he would hide in the shadows,
As she worked the time away,
With her long black hair and her eyes of fire,
And a body to drive men crazy,
It was on that day there would be a change,
In the world of Brother John;

She felt his eyes and she walked up beside him,
And she took him by the hand,
She said, ""Brother John, it's so hard to be holy,
Would you like to be a man?
I will meet you tonight at the monastery wall,
If you're there we will find out together,""

It's not a dream anymore,
Hallelujah! It's finally here,
I've been waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting

In his bed in the heat of the night,
He heard his name and he went to the window,
Where she was in the clear moonlight,
Oh the sins of the flesh are too much to deny,
He was lost to her body forever,
And the Devil laughed and the angels cried,
For the soul of Brother John;

The light that all men seem to fear,
They say that sailors were drowning in the bay,
And people kept away,
Waiting for the riches that a wreck would bring,
When the morning comes,
And on and on that light returns again,
To haunt the ones who would not hear the pain;

I took the old path down, climbing over rocks and stones,
The place I knew when I was young,
And in my fear I had to carry on,
Where no-one else had gone,
Looking in the heart of darkness from above,
To the man inside,
I took my chance and set off for the light,
And started on the journey of my life;

And in the darkest hour that light was calling me,
Through the doorway to another world,
And there below me I saw all the days of my life,
Till the moment I stood on the shore,
Worlds away, this was my destiny,
To be back here in another time,
And all around me I saw the faces that I knew,
Reaching out, ""there is nothing to fear,""

And I know that I don't say it quite as much as I should,
The way I feel, and what you mean to me; 
You are my lover, you are my friend,
You are my life to the very end,
You bring me comfort, you keep me warm,
You give me hope, you make me strong,
You take me away to a distant shore,
And it's with you that I want to stay,
Forevermore; 
We go out at night, you're looking so good,
People turning, as you walk into the room,
And when I stand beside you I can feel the pride in my heart,
To know that you are here with me tonight; 
You are my lover, you are my friend,
You are my life to the very end,
You bring me comfort, you keep me warm,
You give me hope, you make me strong,
You take me away to a distant shore,
And it's with you that I'm going to stay,
Forevermore,

Chris de Burgh,"Please give me one more chance,
I'm begging you, just one more chance,
If you'll listen
This is not some movie romance,
Or everlasting love at a glance,
Won't you listen
She is a part of me now,
She's the very heart of me now, so
If you really love her, let her go.

She's your daughter and I know that you care,
But like a lost bird in the cold night air,
She is lonely
Thinking back to the days you were young,
When the pain of loving was so very strong,
Weren't you lonely?
She is no longer a child,
She's a woman with love in her eyes, so
If you really love her, let her go. 
Oh she is like a bird,
Yearning for the winter wind,
If you let her go,
She'll come again in springtime,
But if you make her stay,
And hold her freedom in your hand,
In the morning you will wake,
And she'll be gone away
She is no longer a child,
She's a woman with my love in her eyes, so
If you really love her, let her go,
If you really love her, let her go,

Chris de Burgh,"The autumn leaves were falling,
On these old cathedral walls,
There were candles in the darkness,
Singing in the choir,
And reading out the names,
Of all the ones who've gone before,
Well I could tell that you were thinking,
About the meaning of it all; And you said to me ""Who will open up my eyes,
To the wonder, and the glory, and the stars in the sky?""
And you said to me ""For this road I'm traveling on,
I need someone beside me forever, who? Who?""

And I said ""It's me, and I'm ready to go,
Ready to show, that I'll never let you down,
And I want you to know, that this power will grow,
Every day, every beat of my heart,
Forever, forever;"" We went down to the river,
And we found a small cafe,
They say that over in the corner,
Sat the writer Ernest Hemingway,
And here he made his story of the lovers in the war,
And through it all they stayed together,
Till the rain had to fall; And you said to me ""Who will be the one apart,
Who will teach me, with conviction, all the ways of the heart?""
And you said to me ""On this journey of my life,
I need someone to love me forever, who? Who?""

And I said, listen ""It's me, and I'm ready to go,
Ready to show, that I'll never let you down,
And I want you to know, that this power will grow,
Every day, every beat of my heart,
I love you, I love you;

Chris de Burgh,"I'm lying here tonight, thinking of the days we've had,
Wondering if the world would be so beautiful,
If I had not looked into your eyes,
How did you know that I've been waiting?
I never knew the world would be so beautiful at all;

I'm spending all the days, dreaming of the nights we've had,
I never knew that love would be a miracle,
When I think of all the ones before,
But now that I've found you I am flying,
I never knew that love would be so beautiful to me,
I never knew that love would be so beautiful to me;

And when we dance to the rhythm that is burning like a flame,
And when you touch me I can hardly move you take my breath away,
You give me all that I want to feel when we become as one,
And then you take me to the heaven of your heart;
Did nobody ever tell you, you're the best thing that has ever been;

Ah, you, ah, so beautiful, ah, so beautiful

I'm standing here tonight, thinking of the time we'll have,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful,
From the day you came into my life,
I just want to say, you make me happy,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful to me,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful to me;

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

'Til we found America,
'Round the Cape of Storms,

And I have brought you gold,
And spices from the Indies in the hold;

When you say she's looking good,
She acts as if it's understood,

A silent prayer, like dreamers do,

In dreams I talk to you,
In dreams you're mine, all of the time,

I can't help it if I cry,

She had a boyfriend in the town, he spent his days just messing around,
With stick shifts and steering wheels, motorbikes and automobiles,
And every night it was the same old thing,

Shoot pool and talk about girls,
And nothing ever happens round here,

An old man with a beard of shining white
He said ""I've been expecting you, let me show you to your room""
And he took me all the way by candlelight
And lying there on the bed, a book, black and red
My name was written on the front in gold
And when I opened it up, there were pictures of my life
And a voice began to call from down below

In this room on the left, a man who did his best
To bring joy and happiness to one and all
But in that room on the right, a dictator in life
We've been waiting for him here, as you can tell
For all the blood the he's spilled, and for all the ones he's killed
We condemn him to eternity in Hell

Chris de Burgh,"There is something on my mind, and I'm loosing concentration,
And I feel it every time that you are near me,
I could tell you all about your picture at my bedside,
I should call you sometime, and talk it over,
'cause I get a kick inside, and I feel a tingle too,
It just comes from time to time,
And it only happens

When I think of you sleeping, when I'm dreaming, when I wake up,
When I think of you walking, when I'm talking, when I look up, when I think of

You take me away to a land of mass confusion,
And I don't know what to say when I am near you,
I could stand here all day long just staring at your window,
But I have so much to do, that's so important,
Then I get a kick inside, and I feel a tingle too,
It just comes from time to time,
And it only happens

When I think of you sleeping, when I'm dreaming, when I wake up,
When I think of you walking, when I'm talking, when I look up, when I think of

You may get the feeling that I'm dancing on the ceiling,
When I get a kick inside, and my head is spinning too,
It just comes from time to time,
And it only happens

When I think of you sleeping, when I'm dreaming, when I wake up,
When I think of you, when I whisper to your picture, when I kiss it, when I think of you

When I think of you, when I'm dreaming we're together, on my sofa,
When I think of you, when I'm wishing that we're kissing, when we're dancing,
When I think of you.",When I Think of You

How've you been, I like the way you have your hair,
But something has changed,
And I can see a woman in your eyes, and in your smile;

Remember when we'd always be together,
And we believed this love would never die,
And ever since then,
I've often wondered how I'd feel if we should meet again;

Well you look beautiful, you look wonderful,
You're like an angel heaven sent to me,
You look beautiful, you look wonderful,

And face the storms of life, I thought I heard you calling,
When your ship hit the rocks,
And here we are, survivors from the sea, just you and me, out on the beach;

If you have time, let's get a cup of coffee,
And talk about all the feelings that we share,
'Cause when there's still love,

Chris de Burgh," spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar,
'twas light years of time since his mission did start,
And over a village he halted his craft,
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star...

He followed light and came down to a share,
Where a mother and a child were lying there on a bed,
A bright light of silver shone round his head,
And he had the face of an angle, and they were afraid...

Then the stranger spoke, he said 'do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
And I bring a message for mankind to hear',
And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air...

And it went la, la...
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child...

This lovely music went trembling through the ground,
And many were wakened on hearing that sound,
And travellers on the road, the village they found,
By the light of that ship in the sky, which shone all round...

And just before dawn at the paving of the sky,
The stranger returned and said 'now I must fly,
When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...'

And it went la la... this song will begin once again
To a baby's cry...
And it goes la la... peace and goodwill to all men
And love for the child...
Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear that song again,
There are thousands standing on the edge of the world,
And a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly here,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...

This is the place we used to go,
With romantic music and the lights down low.
And as you stand there amazed at the door,
And you're wondering what all this is for.
It's just a simple thing from me to you,
The lady that I adore, 'cause there's something,
That you should know, it's that 
I've been missing you, more than words can say,
And that I've been thinking about it every day,
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow,
And I said now I've found you,
I'm never letting go; 
There is no reason to the things that we do,
You can break a heart with just a word or two,
And take a lifetime to apologize,
When the one you love's in front of your eyes,
And I will fall to my knees like a fool,
If it's the only way of getting through,
You see if I think you are beautiful,
Someone else is gonna feel it too,
So there's only one thing to do, tell you that 
I've been missing you, more than words can say,
And that I've been thinking about it every day,
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow,
Because now I've found you, I'm never letting go,

Chris de Burgh,"I'm going out to dinner, with a gorgeous singer,
To a little place I've found down by the quay;
Her name is Patricia, she calls herself Delicia,
And the reason isn't very hard to see

She says God made her a sinner just to keep those fat men thinner,
As they tumble down in heaps before her feet.
They hang around in groups like battle-weary troops,
One can often see them queue right down the street 
You see Patricia, or Delicia, not only is a singer
She also removes all her clothing
For Patricia is the best stripper in town, 
And with a swing of her hips she started to strip,
To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
And with a lick of her lips she undid all the clips,
Threw it all in the air, and everyone stared,
And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
The police were banging on the door,
On a Saturday night, in nineteen twenty-four,
Take it away boys!

But poor Patricia was arrested and everyone detested,
The awful manner in which she was exposed,
Later on in court, well, everybody thought
A summer run in jail would be proposed,

But the judge said, ""Patricia, or may I say, Delicia,
The facts of this case are upstairs in my chamber
See you later, Darling!
Case dismissed, this girl was in her working clothes!!""

And with a swing of her hips, she started to strip,
To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
And with a lick of her lips she undid all her clips,
Threw it all in the air, and everyone stared,
And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
The police were yelling out for more!!!

A soldier boy falls to his knees
And a woman cries in joy and pain

In a country torn from the south to the north
And a family runs from day to day
When will we see our home again?

Life of a child is more than a forest
Life of a child is more than a border, could ever be

A tiny life has just begun
And a mother cries for her hungry baby
When will I feed my boy again?

East or west, it could be anyone
But we all wanna know, will my child survive to see the day
When we will be secure again?

When will we see the simple truth

We were lucky and we saw no enemy,
And came from Switzerland, poor refugees,
Far from the guns of war,
We said godbye to it all.
They brought us in to a nurse's station,
Half a mile behind the lines.
Oh lord, how my heart was breaking,
To see the children, and the walking wounded,
Hoping for a ticket home,
And say goodbye to it all.
I woke up on a cold blue morning,
To see her there, standing right beside me,
Long years since I left her at the borderline,
And how she found me I'll never know,
But we decided there and then,
To say goodbye to it all.

Found a small hotel by the coast,
As we walked along the beaches of Normandy,

And whispered a prayer for the boys,
Who said goodbye to it all.

And I have a job in the old hotel,

It is better to have tried in vain than never try at all,

And though I had my darkness days,
I sailed the stars and I found what I was looking for,

Ace of all and king of none,
With hands that hurt from knocking on so many doors;

It is better to have tried in vain than never try at all,

Chris de Burgh,"If beds could talk, mine would be singing,
Singing about the time when you and I were lovers,
All night long we could not stop,
They were amazing times, they were the crazy times,
They were the best that I have known,
Another place to fly, another taste to try,
We were awake in a beautiful dream;

If beds could talk, mine would be saying,
Come back and hold me in your arms again,
If beds could talk, mine would be calling,
Come back and let me love you once again;

If walls could hear, mine would remember,
Every word we said when you and I were lovers,
All night long we could not stop,
Remember every kiss and every touch of lips,
And every sensual delight,
They were hypnotic times, they were erotic times,
They were a thousand Arabian nights;

If beds could talk, mine would be saying,
Come back and hold me in your arms again,
If beds could talk, mine would be calling,
Come back and let me love you once again;

If beds could talk, if walls could hear,
If windows see, imagine
The moments and the memories, they all come flooding back,
If tables turn, if wheels caress,
If mirrors see the passion, you'd be the best of them all;

If beds could talk, mine would be saying,
Come back and hold me in your arms again,
If beds could talk, mine would remember, so
Come back and let me love you once again,

If beds could talk, mine would be singing,
If beds could talk, mine would remember,
If beds could talk, mine would be calling,
If beds could talk, mine would be waiting,

Chris de Burgh,"It was late in a Lebanese restaurant,
In the heat of a Lebanese night,
There was dancing, people were singing,
She came in from the garden outside,
In her eyes I saw the stars,
And I felt something happen in my heart;

Then I knew I was going to meet her,
In the heat of a Lebanese night,
And the girl inside the woman,
who came over to sit by my side,
And when she smiled the whole world stopped,
It was then I heard the echoes of a child; 
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night; 
We went down to the edge of the water,
By the light of a Lebanese dawn,
And she told me all the stories of her beautiful land in the war,
Her tears fell down, the sun came up,
And I saw again the young girl in her eyes; 
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night; 
In Lebanese:
All of my life, all I have known,
Only a place where peace cannot go,
All over the world, the gift from before,
Nothing is left for the children of war; 
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night,
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night, 
I will be waiting, in the Lebanon.",Lebanese Night

With someone who looked a lot like you,
But just as our lips were starting to kiss,
I woke up on the floor;

It's one of those nights for standing around,
And talking to people that I hardly know,
An incoming tone came up on my phone,
It was an SMS and it said:

""Save me, I think I've had enough of this,
Save me, you are the one who can,
Save me, take me away from here;""

I look in the room, there's nobody there,
And then I saw her with the long blonde hair,
I could not believe the girl in my dream,
Was waiting at the door, and she said:

""Save me, I think I've had enough of this,
Save me, you are the one who can,
Save me, take me away from here;""

Oh, cue a hundred days and nights of special sensuality,
Since lady luck came knocking on my door;

Another SMS, and it said:

""Save me, I think I'm getting out of it,
Save me, no doubt about it,

There is nothing that the heart can't feel,
There is nothing that a love can't heal,

And you discover that timing is everything,
You've got to get it right,

Chris de Burgh,"""What do I do next?"" said the bishop to the priest,
""I have spent my whole life waiting, preparing for the feast,
And now you say Jerusalem has fallen and is lost,
The king of heathen Saracen has seized the holy cross;""

Then the priest said ""Oh my bishop, we must put them to the sword,
For God in all His mercy will find a just reward,
For the noblemen and sinners, and knights of ready hand,
Who will be the Lord's Crusader, send word through all the land, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost;"" 
""Tell me what to do"", said the king upon his throne,
""but speak to me in whispers for we are not alone,
They tell me that Jerusalem has fallen to the hand,
Of some bedeviled eastern Heathen who has seized the Holy Land;""

Then the chamberlain said ""Lord, we must call upon our foes
In Spain and France and Germany to end our bitter wars,
All Christian men must be as one and gather for the fight,
You will be their leader, begin the battle cry, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost""
Ooh, high on a hill, in the town of Jerusalem,
There stood Saladin, the king of the Saracens,
Whoring and drinking and snoring and sinking, around him his army lay,
Secure in the knowledge that he had won the day;

A messenger came, blood on his feet and a wound in his chest,
""The Christians are coming!"" he said, ""I have seen their cross in the west,""
In a rage Saladin struck him down with his knife,
And he said ""I know that this man lies,
They quarrel too much, the Christians could never unite! 
I am invincible, I am the king,
I am invincible, and I will win..."" 
Closer they came, the army of Richard the Lionheart,
Marching by day and night, with soldiers from every part,
And when the Crusaders came over the mountain and they saw Jerusalem,
They fell to their knees and prayed for her release;

They started the battle at dawn, taking the city by storm,
With horsemen and bowmen and engines of war,
They broke through the city walls,
The Heathens were flying and screaming and dying,
And the Christian swords were strong,
And Saladin ran when he heard their victory song; 
""We are invincible, God is the king,
We are invincible, and we will win!"" 
""What do I do now?"" said the wise man to the fool,
""I have spent my whole life searching, to find the Golden Rule,
Though centuries have disappeared, the memory still remains,
Of those enemies together, could it be that way again?""

Then the fool said ""Oh you wise men, you really make me laugh,
With your talk of vast persuasion and searching through the past,
There is only greed and evil in the men who fight today,
The song of the Crusader has long since gone away, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost

And so many arms are still open for that final mystery,

He heard a wild dog howl,
There were voices in the night, ""Don't do it!""
Voices out of sight, ""Don't do it!
Too many men have failed before,
Whatever you do,

Don't pay the ferryman,
Don't even fix a price,
Don't pay the ferryman,
Until he gets you to the other side""
In the rolling mist, then he gets on board,
Now there'll be no turning back,
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder,
And then the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared,
And people calling out his name,
And dancing bones that jabbered and a-moaned
On the water.
And then the ferryman said,
""There is trouble ahead,
So you must pay me now,"" ""Don't do it!""
""You must pay me now,"" ""Don't do it!""
And still that voice came from beyond,
""Whatever you do,

Don't pay the ferryman,
Don't even fix a price,
Don't pay the ferryman,
Until he gets you to the other side;

Don't pay - the ferryman!""",Don't Pay the Ferryman [Multimedia Track]

Chris de Burgh,"It’s a rainy night in Paris,
And the harbour lights are low
He must leave his love in Paris
Before the winter snow;

On a lonely street in Paris
He held her close to say,
""we’ll meet again in Paris
When there are flowers on the champs-elysees ""

""how long"" she said ""how long,
And will your love be strong,
When you’re across the sea,
Will your heart remember me? ""

Then she gave him words to turn to,
When the winter nights were long,
""nous serons encore amoureux
Avec les couleurs du printemps ""

""and then"" she said ""and then,
Our love will grow again""
Ah but in her eyes he sees
Her words of love are only words to please

I will never see her again",A Rainy Night in Paris [Multimedia Track]

It was raining all night long
We were lucky and we saw no enemy
And came from Switzerland, poor refugees
Far from the guns of war
We said goodbye to it all

They brought us into a nurse's station
Half a mile behind the lines
Oh Lord, how my heart was breaking
To see the children, and the walking wounded
Hoping for a ticket home
And say goodbye to it all

I woke up on a cold blue morning
To see her there, standing right beside me
Long years since I left her at the borderline

As we walked along the beaches of Normandy

Now we've got our own place by the water
And I have a job in the old hotel

Chris de Burgh,"There's a Spanish train that runs between
Guadalquivir and old Saville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people hear she's running still

And then they hush their children back to sleep
Lock the doors, upstairs they creep
For it is said that the souls of the dead
Fill that train ten thousand deep

Well a railwayman lay dying with his people by his side
His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died
But above his bed just a waiting for the dead
Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye
Well God's not around and look what I've found, this one's mine

Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light
And shouted at the Devil, get thee hence to endless night
But the Devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
But there's no need to push me around
I got him first so you can do your worst
He's going underground

But I think I'll give you one more chance
Said the Devil with a smile
So throw away that stupid lance
It's really not your style
Joker is the name, poker is the game
We'll play right here on this bed
And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet
The souls of the dead

And I said look out, Lord, He's going to win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, He's going to win

Well the railwayman he cut the cards
And he dealt them each a hand of five
And for the Lord, he was praying hard
Or that train he'd have to drive
Well the Devil he had three aces and a king
And the Lord, he was running for a straight
He had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades
All he needed was the eight

And then the Lord he called for one more card
But he drew the diamond eight
And the Devil said to the son of God
I believe you've got it straight
So deal me one for the time has come
To see who'll be the king of this place
But as he spoke, from beneath his cloak
He slipped another ace

Ten thousand souls was the opening bid
And it soon went up to fifty nine
But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did
And he said that suits me fine
I'll raise you high to a hundred and five
And forever put an end to your sins
But the Devil let out a mighty shout, my hand wins

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you let him win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, don't let him win

Well that Spanish train still runs between
Guadalquivir and old Saville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people fear she's running still

And far away in some recess
The Lord and the Devil are now playing chess
The Devil still cheats and wins more souls
And as for the Lord, well, he's just doing his best

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you've got to win

That train is still on time, oh my soul is on the line

Chris de Burgh,"She had the grace of a dancer, pretty as the morning sun,
Her days were filled with laughter, and when sixteen years had come,
She went to work in the old house, and there she met her love,
But he, the son, was high-born, and she, a village girl

They met at night by the river, and there he pledged his love,
And so it was for the summer, but by winter, all was done,
For the word was out in the village that she would have his child,
And the night before she left him, these words were in his heart,
When she said, ""Love is all that we have, it is forever,
Love is all that we need, to be together,
Love is all that this world has to share, only love
Can take us there""

They found her clothes by the river, of her there was no trace,
And for many years he mourned her, haunted by her face,
So he set off over the ocean, these memories to escape,
But the ship he sailed was ill-starred, and soon would meet its fate

They struck the rocks at midnight, in the grip of a roaring storm,
And he found himself in the water with a woman and a boy,
With a power that was more than human, he brought them to the shore,
And her whisper in the darkness was a voice he'd heard before,
When she'd said, ""Love is all that we have, it is forever,
Love is all that we need, to be together,
Love is all that this world has to share,
Only love can take us there""

And the memories came rolling back of Leningrad in the war,

For the girl in the photograph, much had changed in the years that passed,
But her longing for the boy she loved was still the same since the war,

It was a moonless night upon the road of life, when he'd held her to say goodbye,
Many more would survive, for he stayed behind to help them live again,

When they met at the garden gate, tears would fall from a deep embrace,
For she never knew what happened to the boy she loved in the war,

Back in those happy days, before the soldiers came,
To break down the ones who remained,
And they only survived, who could learn to die, and live to fight again,

Chris de Burgh,"Brother, there's a man at the gate, he has something in his hand;
He says it fell down from the sky, should I let him in?
Maybe it's an omen, maybe it will take away our sin, our sin.....

'Tis a diamond that he has, the biggest one I've ever seen,
And when he holds it in his hand, it's shining like the sun,
He says it's from another world, he calls it the mirror of the soul;

We must place it on the altar high, send the Devil to the fire,
Power over men we'll have when they see it shine, when they see it shine;

Brother, fetch the Abbot now, tell him of this wondrous thing,
Tell him that we'll have control of all the riches it will bring;
When people come to see it, for money we will purify their souls, their souls;

With my knife I'll kill this man, I'll send him to the Promised Land,
And when we take the diamond, we will have the future in our hands,
In our hands;

When we place it on the altar high, send the Devil to the fire,
Power over men we'll have when they see it shine, when they see it shine!

That's how it started, that whole new religion, and people everywhere,
Had to give up all their possessions at the Abbe St. Pierre,
But with their gold they could buy a redemption, and the promise of
Eternal life,
And the center of it all was a diamond divine,
It was up there on the altar high but for the monks it would not shine,
So with subterfuge they used the light of the sun, fooling everyone;

It was late at night when a young boy was in there with his friends,
And they dared him up to the altar, to touch the famous gem,
And when he did, the whole place exploded with a great and wonderful light,
And people came from everywhere to see it,
When he took it from the altar high, everyone could make it shine,
Except the Abbot and his men, for them, no light,
They could not make it shine.

And in the end, many heard the brothers, making confession of the 
Things they had done,
And the Abbot led that sad procession, as they went through the
Gate past the place where it had begun;

And all their dreams of glory, all their schemes and stories,
Would come to nothing after all,
Because a power greater from the world's creator
Gave us love to light the mirror of the soul,
Only love can light the mirror of the soul;

All through the world, there are many others, who always follow
Everything they are told,
By men with rules and regulations, using old superstitions and
Tales to assume control;

But all their dreams of glory, all their schemes and stories,
Will come to nothing after all,
Because a power greater from the world's creator
Gave us love to light the mirror of the soul,
Only love can light the mirror of the soul;

Chris de Burgh,"Last night I dreamed again that I was by your side,
I felt your tender kiss, and with your lips on mine,
My world became, complete again,
Beneath the shadow of the mountain, we were lovers till the dawn
Was on the sea

But with the morning sun the dream had disappeared,
And I awoke and still believed that you were here,
But soon the day will come again, beneath the shadow of the mountain,
I'll be with you when my soldier's work is done

When the summer winds begin to blow,
That is when I will be sailing to my home,
To the olive trees and the golden corn
That whispers in the fields up in the hills beyond the place
Where I was born

And here in Rome the talk is all about the war,
As men of Caesar we have heard those words before,
And though I'm strong, my heart belongs
Beneath the shadow of the mountain and my lover who is waiting
There for me

When the summer winds begin to blow,
That is when you'll see the sails that bring me home,
To the olive trees and the golden corn
That whispers in the fields up in the hills above Pompeii
Where I was born
I will return
Beneath the shadow of Vesuvius we'll be together till the day we die.....

Chris de Burgh,"I was an eagle but I cannot fly,
I was a lion, but I run no more,
I was a river, but the river's dry,
And soon the spirit is coming to take me home

I've seen the sunrise in a thousand ways,
I've seen the wonder of a summer storm,
I've seen a mountain that touched the sky,
And soon the spirit is coming to take me home

Do not cry for me, I am with the stars,
Do not cry for me, I am in the wind,
Do not cry for me, I am with the rain,
And soon the spirit is coming to take me home

I have my children, I have seen them grow,
I have a garden that is all the world,
We come with nothing, that's how we'll go,
And soon the spirit is coming to take me home

Do not cry for me, I am with the sun,
Do not cry for me, I am in the wind,
Do not cry for me, I am with the stars,
And soon the spirit is coming to take me home

I was an eagle, but I cannot fly,
And now the spirit has come to take me home.",Spirit
Chris de Burgh,"I lived my life in the words of a Storyman,
Watched my dreams from the years gone by,
Heard my voice in the songs of a Storyman,
Always by my side, always by my side;

I saw him first in a castle by candlelight,
Turning round with a golden key,
I heard a train far away, and a whistle blow,
Like a baby's cry, 'twas like a baby's cry;

Ravens stood on the walls of Jerusalem,
Sailors danced at the borderline,
Light a fire on the road to the ferryman,
Emotions running high, in the summertime;

Take me back to the places I've never been,
Take me back to another time,
Take me back to a world I have never seen,
Only in my mind, only in my mind;

Late last night I met up with a lady-love,
Dressed in red, didn't say goodbye,
Carry me to the last time I showed her what
Tender hands can do, and I'll be missing you;

Take me back to the places I've never been,
Take me back to another time,
Take me back to a world I have never seen,
Only in my mind, only in my mind;

Follow the light that's shining on to where we will be going,
Up to Heaven, Paradise, or to the heart divine;
It's in the echoes of a child, waiting for the journey,
The spirit of one world;

Oh take me back to the places I've never been,
Take me back to another time,
Take me back to a world I have never seen,
Only in my mind, only in my mind;",The Storyman

Chris de Burgh,"And so the play begins, and though it is the final night,
My heart will sing, just to be beside her now is everything,
And though it's a play I believe every word that I say,
'Cause I'm in love with her;

I am her Romeo, and every night my Juliet will have to go,
With poison and the knife we die to end the show,
But nobody knows that tonight when the curtain falls,
She will be waiting at the door, we will not hide it anymore;

No-one can come between this love and destiny,
With freedom there will be the sweetest kiss of all;

And now the play is done, and there are those who do not know
What has begun, and do not see that love should be for everyone,
But to marry a man from a far-away land is not right,
So she will be with me tonight, and for all this we will fight;

No-one can come between our love and destiny,
With freedom there will be the sweetest kiss of all,
With freedom there will be the sweetest kiss of all.",The Sweetest Kiss of All
Chris de Burgh,"These broken wings can take me no further,
I'm lost, and out at sea,
I thought these wings would hold me forever,
And on to eternity,
And far away I can hear your voice,
I can hear it in the silence of the morning,
But these broken wings have let me down,
They can't even carry me home.

In broken dreams that keep me from sleeping,
I remember all the things I said,
Well I've broken all the promises,
I said I would be keeping,
They're gone, like leaves they fell,
For it's so hard when you're far away,
All I needed was a shoulder I could cry on,
Now these broken dreams have woken me,
My love, will you carry me home. Or will you treat me like some traveler,
On a dark and lonely road,
Who sees a light and a woman who will give him love,
Oh and just when she reaches the part,
When she's supposed to comfort his broken heart,
She turns away, and sends him traveling on, on,
Oh when I left I believed that nothing would go wrong,
I thought the whole world would be waiting for my story,
Take me back, my love, I need you now,
Come back and carry me home,
Take me back and heal theses broken wings,
Come back and carry me home.",Broken Wings [Live]
Chris de Burgh,"It's a rainy night in Paris,
And the harbor lights are low.
He must leave his love in Paris
Before the winter snow;

On a lonely street in Paris
He held her close to say,
""We'll meet again in Paris
When there are flowers on the Champs-Elysees.""

""How long"" she said ""how long,
And will your love be strong,
When you're across the sea,
Will your heart remember me?""

Then she gave him words to turn to,
When the winter nights were long,
""Nous serons encore amoureux
Avec les couleurs do printemps""

""And then"" she said ""and then,
Our love will grow again.""
Ah but in her eyes he sees
Her words of love are only words to please

And now the lights of Paris
Grow dim and fade away,
And I know by the light of Paris
I will never see her again",A  Rainy Night in Paris
Chris de Burgh,"I hear the drums echoing tonight, 
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation, 
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight, 
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars
That guide me towards salvation, 
I stopped an old man along the way, 
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient memories, 
He turned to me as if to say, 
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"" 

Gonna to take a lot to drag me away from you, 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do, 
I'll bless the rains down in Africa, 
Going to take some time to do the things we never had;  

Wild dogs cry out in the night, 
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company, 
I know that I must do what's right, 
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti, 
I seek to cure what's deep inside,  
Frightened of this thing that I've become, 

Gonna to take a lot to drag me away from you, 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do, 
I'll bless the rains down in Africa, 
Going to take some time to do the things we never had;

Chris de Burgh,"""There must be some way out of here,""
Said the joker to the thief,
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plough men dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,
""There are many here among us now,
Who feel that life is but a joke,
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late""

All along the Watchtower, Princes kept the view,
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl

""There must be some way out of here""",All Along the Watchtower
Chris de Burgh,"Long long time ago, I can still remember,
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance,
That I could make those people dance,
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver,
With every paper I'd deliver,
Bad news on the doorstep,
I couldn't walk one more step

I can't remember if I cried,
When I read about his widowed bride,
But something touched me deep inside,
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie,
Drove my Chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry,
Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye,
Singing this will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die

Did you write the Book of Love,
And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so,
Do you believe in rock 'n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

And I know that you're in love with him,
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
You both kicked off your shoes,
And I dig those rhythm and blues,

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck,
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
But I knew I was out of luck,
The day the music died I started singing

Bye-bye, Miss American Pie,
Drove my Chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry,
Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye,
Singing this will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die

Now for ten years we've been on our own,
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
But that's not how it used to be,
When the jester sang for the King and Queen,
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean,
And a voice that came from you and me

Ah but while the King was looking down,
The jester stole his thorny crown,
The courtroom was adjourned,
No verdict was returned,
And Lenin read from the book of Marx,
A Quartet practiced in the park,
And we sang dirges in the dark,
The day the music died We were singing

Bye-bye, Miss American Pie,
Drove my Chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry,
Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye,
Singing this will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die

Bye-bye, Miss American Pie,

By the cruel hand of evil at the setting of the sun,
His arrow was loosed and it flew through the dark,
And his true love was slain as the shaft found its mark

She'd her apron wrapped about her,
And he took her for a swan,
And it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von

He ran up beside her and found that it was she,
He turned away his face for he could not bear to see,
He lifted her up and he found she was dead,
A fountain of tears for his true love he shed

She'd her apron wrapped about her,
And he took her for a swan,
And it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von

He carried her off to his home by the sea,
Crying' ""Father, oh Father, I've murdered poor Polly!
I've killed my fair love in the flower of her life,
I'd always intended that she be my wife""

""But she'd her apron wrapped about her
And I took her for a swan,
And it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von""

He roamed near the place where his true love was slain,
And wept bitter tears, but his cries were all in vain,
As he looked on the lake, a swan glided by,
And the sun slowly set in the grey of the sky

And I took her for a swan,

Reading from a map in the mind

And there's the boat on the river

And then the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered and  a moaned
On the water

There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now (don't do it)

And as for me my feet are almost gone
My treadings are well nigh slipped
But let not the waterflood drown me
 
Neither let the deep swallow me up;

Oh, it's a dangerous life boys,

When you're running from the Revenue

And so to escape it came now for Elzevir to pick up the boy, 
and carry him away, 
For he could not walk with a bullet in the leg, 
and they made for the safety of the Purbeck cave

T'was there that John would read one night,
The words in the locket by candlelight,
For the Bible verses held the key to Blackbeard's hidden treasure,
at the bottom of a Castle well

Oh, it's a dangerous world boys,
Oh, in a smuggler's life,
Oh, in the Days of our Age boys,
That's where the secret of the Treasure lies,

Well I couldn't be better
I found my way
She is an open door to a brand new day

Everywhere I go I see her face again
Everywhere I look I see her smile and wave
Everywhere I hear her voice is calling
This time I finally opened my eyes to a beautiful angel
Oh who's been caring for me like a mother for a child

Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go I see the shadow of a light
It shines on me it shines on me from another time

So many dark days and lonely nights
Until she found the way to change my life

Everywhere I go I see her face again
Everywhere I look I see her smile and wave
Everywhere I hear her voice is calling

And in your heart you have been waiting
For this moment to come
Within these walls
You have heard words of inspiration
That have opened your eyes

I am old
But there's a wisdom that comes with years
You are young and it's so easy when you have no fears

Go, go where your heart believes
Your memories are waiting
It's the only way to find out who you are

In this life
There is a road that you must follow
To the left or the right
One is wide but the other is hard and narrow
Take this one and you can call it your own
There will so many voices trying to turn you round
Take a moment just to listen then carry on

Go, go where your heart believes
Your memories are waiting
It's the only way to find out who you are

There will be times when you're lost and lonely
And you will have no-one beside you
And that is when you'll find the hidden one inside

My friend for many years
He saved me from the water
Now I'm drowning in my tears
 
Grief is but a poor word for everything I feel
There can be no greater love
 
He was there to guide me through the follies of my age
Always there beside me everything forgave
Held me as a father showing me the way
There can be no greater love
 
No fear did he have before the storm
The fate of others was his only thought
And though it was the way to certain darkness
 
To save my life he gave his own
 
For my life he gave his own
And these words are writ in stone where he lies

T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly stolen only pain and sorrow there, have a care!""
 
So t'was from the world of smugglers that I hid myself that night
And when they left I opened up the coffin for a look inside

When out of the sea they came to jump and fly,
Now I understand why my friend said,
""Dolphins make us cry""

'Cause this was pure joy the way they laughed and played,
Skipping and a-dancing through the ocean waves,
It was pure joy for all to see,
So why can't we, more often feel that joy of living?

And we were talking about how in the days gone by,
We would believe that all our dreams could fly,
But they fade away, like sunset out of the sky

And I was there in a garden where the children play,
Hearing them singing on a summer's day,
Made me realize how soon we lose that innocence inside

Skipping and a-dancing on that sunny day,
It was pure joy for all to see,

Chris Difford,"When I was crowned a mummy¹s boy 
by friends I didn¹t like 
I made a meal of trips to school 
upon my fathers bike 
and I used to sit between his legs, 
perched on a piece of wood 
and if it ever rained on us 
I slipped beneath his hood, 
at home the radio was on 
Œwall papered all those years, 
the world was such a simple place 
with music to my ears. 

From Julie Andrews 
to Gerry Garcia 
life was all fun and games 
I was out of my head, 
and underneath my bed 
playing with electric trains. 

I met my friends at Sunday school 
and playing on the field, 
inside my bedroom there I found 
the future was concealed 
my records stacked up in a pile, 
collected from the chart 
with pictures pinned up on the wall 
I found my beating heart, 
and at home the stereo was on 
my feet stomped the floor, 
a Fender willow cricket bat 
had left me wanting more. 

From Julie Andrews 
to Gerry Garcia 
life was all fun and games 
I was out of my head, 
and underneath my bed 
playing with electric trains. 

Kneeling with my torch light 
turning my transformer 
sleeping in my wet dreams 
with my eyeballs stuck in readers wife¹s, 
pubic hairs were proudly 
counted everyday I woke 
manhood took me slowly 
down and down and down...... 

I chased the girls and made them cry 
my hair grew down my back 
the contents of my teenage years 
were spent down in the sack 
and I played guitar and formed a band, 
I pewked up all night long 
as people came to sit and stare 
while I raced through my song, 
at home there was sadly nothing on 
my childhood had to end, 
the Sound of Music passed me by 
just like the Grateful Dead.

to Gerry Garcia

From Julie Andrews 
to Gerry Garcia 
climbing in that photograph 
I can touch my stupid face 
I chose the road to here and now 
and this very special place 
where all I am is all I breath 
its a sober world I chase 
so I can fix these broken tracks, 
playing with electric trains.

Chris Difford,"I'm never thin I'm never svelte 
I always wore the bigger belt 
I never thought I needed help choosing what to eat each moutful 
A real treat but when I look and see there's a greater part of me

I see the men who work at the gym they have a ripple 
With every limb they never have this excess skin 
To cover up their age we're on a different page 
I look like a tree there's a greater part of me
It's so hard to put on my socks each morning 
When I wake I see myself when I was thin 

And the hearts I used to break
Now I have tits just like my mum 
I'm out breath before I run I like to eat 
Because it's fun but it comes at such a price. 
I'm on the old brown rice and the herbal tea 

For the greater part of me
I always played the boy in goal cross country runs 
Became a stroll I was the doughnut and the hole 
But inside I felt great I always licked my plate my face 

Full of beans there's a greater part of me
It's so hard to put on my socks each morning 
When I wake I see myself when I was thin and the hearts 
I used to break and it's so hard to pull in the street 
But it never seems too late, it's so hard",Fat as a Fiddle
Chris Domingo,"Embracing the goddess' energy within yourselves,
Will bring all of you to a new understanding and value of life.
A vision that inspires you to live and love on Planet Earth.
Like a priceless jewel,
Buried in dark layers of soil and stone.
Earth radiates her brilliant beauty,
Into the caverns of space and time.
Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home,
And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality.
You are becoming aware of yourself as a gamemaster.

Imagine Earth restored to her regal beauty.
Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky.
Clouds billow to form majestic peaks.
The songs of birds fill the air,
Creating symphony upon symphony.
The goddess is calling for and honoring
Of what she allows to be created
From the core-mystery of the blood.
Those who own her planet are learning about love.",Game Master

Begin to colour me

These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away
Colour them grey
This is the heart that thought he would always be true
Colour it blue

These are the arms that held him and touched him
Lost him somehow
Colour them empty now
These are the beads I wore
Until she came between
Colour them green

This is the room that I sleep in and walk in
And weep in and hide in
That nobody, nobodys seen
Oh, colour it lonely, please

This is the man whose love I depended upon
Colour him gone

Chris Farlowe,"Hello Josephine.  How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame


Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

You used to live over yonder by the railroad track.
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that.

I can't surrender to you

I know those party games too

Chris Farlowe,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

That your Grandad had to sweat so you could buy

That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion
As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

And you don't know why
Your lips, they move
And they only lie

Your house is white
It's got nice things inside
When you are through
You'd better run and hide
In awe, in awe

This brigade of girls and boys
We will rid of you
And of your dangerous toys
Like father, like son and so on
And so forth, in awe, in awe

But we, we will win first place!!!
And you, we'll never tell you how
But you shoulda known by now

You have killed them
And you don't know
You don't know why

It's no big news, you know?

Me crying in my underwear
On the morning, of Halloween
Like a story out of people magazine
I drove home, and fell asleep alone

I'm sorry, for crying, don't feel bad
You didn't do that

Black and blues, and yellows too
Fade the stain 
As embers do
Wake up tomorrow, and feel new,

The story, that we won't share
Were all goin' to hide it well away somewhere,
A warning for family
The kind a person give about anatomy

Now, well known, 
Lets never sleep alone

You didn't do that

Chris Helbling,"Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, you tried to tell me so,
But how was I to know
That she was not the one for me?

You told me all along,
You're right, our love was so wrong.
But now I changed my mind,
Because she broke the ties that bind,
And I know that she never cared for me.

Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,
I guess I'm not so smart.
Oh, you tried to tell me along she'd only break my heart.
I'm left, you're right, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.

Well, she's gone I know not where,
But now I just don't care.
For now I'm falling for you.

If you'll forgive me now,
I'll make it up somehow.
So happy we will be,
In a home just for three,
And I'll soon forget her,
Now I know.

Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,

Chris Hillman,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

You made me think that I could need you 
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you 
Lookin back on you and me, promises that will never be 
I truly thought we were lovers 
But now I find that I'm just like all the others 
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me 
Played with fire, felt its burn 
I would have thought that I would have learned 
I melted every time you kissed me 
Every time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me

I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Standin' right along side of you

Do you think we love the pain as a way to keep things new?

Back past the place where we meet.

Some things you'll never forget.

Who lives in you house today?
Let's see if we can remember,

Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me.

Tell me that you missed me
Is that so, I don't know

And you're always on my mind
And I see you everywhere
No more crying now, no more crying

And I'm hoping that you want me
Like you've been saying but I don't know if it's so
When you put your arms around me
I close my eyes believing but is it so, baby I don't know

And you're always on my mind

Chris Isaak,"Broken skies, 
Heartaches that flowers won't mend
Say goodbye 
Knowing that this is the end
Tender dreams, shadows fall
Love too sweet, to recall
Dry your eyes, Face the dawn

Life will go on
All day long thought 
That we still had a chance
Letting go, this is the end of romance
Broken hearts find your way
Make it through just this day
Face the world on your own

Life will go on, life will go on
There'll be blue skies, every true love
Someday I'll hold you again
They'll be blue skies in a better world,

Chris Isaak,"Days can be lonely
Night lets you down
Wonder and wander
There's no one around
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
I can feel my heart breaking
And it's all 'cause of you

Nothing to say now, nowhere to hide
I can feel my heart breaking
All the love left inside

Each time I've called you, 
You said we were through
All that I wanted is to be with you
There's nothing to show now, nowhere to go
Nothing to tell you, 
You don't love me no more
Nothing to say now, nowhere to hide
I can feel my heart breaking
All the love left inside

But if in your heart, you could love me too
Let me come back home
I can change for you
If you ever find, that you miss me too
If you want me back
I'll be there for you
Days can be lonely
Days can be lonely 

Daytime is lonely
Night gets me blue
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
Nothing to say now, nothing to show
I can tell you don't love me, you don't want me no more
Nothing to say now, nothing to do
Oh, my heart it was breaking
I've been praying for you
So if in your heart, you can find a way
Just to take me back, let me try again

Or only a ring, oh baby

I notice the ring, does it mean anything
You don't gotta fool me if you say it's only jewelry
I believe you when you slip off the ring, oh baby

Just what did she mean

And mail it right away

Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar

Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos

No quiero interrupciones

Pasaste lista de opciones 
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa mañana y la cubana llega a Paris 
Llámate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil

Diciendo mil cosas 
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá 
Por mi vida famosa 
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa 
Tú sabes que yo soy real 
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer 
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver 
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby 
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti 

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal 
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar 
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar 
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar 

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo 
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo 
Ahora él te pone a llorar, también te pone a sufrir 
Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir

Neglected in the weeds

Just keeps growing on and on
And it's time, I bring the harvest home

And I broke right down and cried

Across the great divide

And in my dreams the grass was green
On Sunset Boulevard

I'll wake up in her arms, yeah, back home on the farm

I'd probably come to the ceremony with a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side
Where I'd light a match
Sit and stare through the smoke and flames and wonder how I'm gonna get back

Chris Knight,"I use to run from the past
But the world got to spinnin' so fast
I run from the future now
I run as fast as I can
Tryin' to be a simple man
I just want to slow down

[Chorus]
Well laugh if you want to
Call me a backwards fool
But I ain't takin' this ride
Ya'll just go on ahead and go
Let me out by the side of the road
All I wanna do is go on home

Don't go online I don't watch TV
Cause I know all I'm gonna see
Is something stupid goin' on
Stupids in the water these days
They're gonna drink it any way
Till they don't know right from wrong

Yeah all I wanna do is go on home",Go on Home
Chris Knight,"I grew up near what they call the flats
Ain't too many people knows where its at
Cant hear the highway cant see a way out
I guarantee it ain't nothin' worth cryin' about

Daddy left us all back in '91
Left us all wonderin' what it was we done
Id stand in the yard and stare down the road
I guess I must have missed how I just don't know

[Chorus]
Got the broken promises
Got the broken home
Don't break yourself on a
Heart of stone

I married a girl I met in Tennessee
The baby didn't make it, so neither did we
I still think about her but shes fadin' fast
It don't do no good dwellin' on the past

[Chorus]

Well I call momma every now and then
To say I'm comin' home but I don't know when
Well I ran into daddy but its been so long
I don't tell momma, I don't let on

[Chorus]

Well I got drunk with daddy just the other night
He said ""he was glad to see I turned out alright""
I hear people sayin' ""like father like son""
Don't think about it much but I worry bout it some

A heart of stone
Don't break yourself
On a heart of stone
Don't break yourself
On a heart of stone",Heart of Stone
Chris Knight,"Get up in the morning, fall out of bed
Go down to the basement, cook up a little meth

Got the light on for you son
Hell ain't half full

They chased God and Jesus out of our schools
And everybody's living by their own set of rules
Yeah, they're preaching on the corner, nothing good to say
Better think of something boy, come the judgment day

Hey, hell ain't half full
Got the light on for you son
Hell ain't half full
No need to run

Dreamed I had a crystal ball
There wasn't much hope in the world I saw
Yeah, there wasn't no love and there wasn't no law
And up in heaven above, God wasn't paying much attention at all

I was born movin' down the line
I'm a homesick gypsy
I ain't home till I leave you behind

I got a girl in every town I play
I'm sure missin' the one I had yesterday

When I'm gone

As much as I want to turn around
I gotta keep drivin' on
The road to me forgetting you
Is hard and its long
When I remember how much I loved you
I just remember how you done me wrong
Its something to keep my going
When I'm gone

Still got your photograph in my wallet
Don't know why I don't throw it away
I use to take it out and look at you
To get me through the day
Now I realize when I look in your eyes
I never really knew you at all
Its something to keep my going

Chris Knox,"Hello my friend
It's morning, time to wake now
Your body and mine entwined will have to break now
I want your flesh, your warmth to stay beside me
Oh, how I wish you could be deep inside me

Show me your eyes, your love, most tender feeling
And I'll give you mine, be truthful and revealing

'Cause it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
It's love not given lightly
But I knew this was love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

When we're alone I cannot always face you
Maybe my mood won't let these arms embrace you
That doesn't mean my love's somehow diminished
Give me the time to show our love's unfinished

'Cause it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly
But I knew this was love
And it's you that I love 
And it's more than what it might be

I need your body, your mind and your emotions
Shed me your tears till I drown in your oceans

'Cause it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
It's love not given lightly
But I knew this was love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

And every word I sing is true

What can I say the words destroy all meaning
There's only cliche to get across this feeling

That it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly

This is a love song to John and Leisha's mother
This isn't easy 
I might not write another

A bareback rider's what I wanna be I want the whole world to know about me
In the rodeo arena I'll take my stand I wanna be known as a rodeo man
I'll come flyin' from the chute with my spurs up high
Chaps and boots reachin' for the sky
Spurrin' wild with my head throw'd back
You'll ask whose that well that's Bareback Jack
You'll ask whose that well that's Bareback Jack

The years of boyhood now have passed
It didn't take long to learn the tricks real fast
Now I'm goin' down the road with my rodeo gear
And I hope to make the finals in just a few years
And when my chance comes I'll give it a whirl
Try to win the championship of the world
I'll come flyin' from the chutes with my spurs up high
Chaps and boots reachin' for the sky
Spurrin' a wild with my head flung back
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack

Well here I am I'm a layin' in bed
The son of a buck jumped onto my head
I'm a-layin' here dyin' and a hurtin' real bad
Now I wish I'd listened to my old dad
When he said son you'd better stop foolin' around
You're gonna get your guts stomped into the ground
You'll come flyin' from the chute with your tail up high
That old buckin' horse is gonna throw ya in the sky
When you come down you're gonna break your back
Then we'll all know you as Old Crippled Up Jack
And that'll be all for ol' Bareback Jack!

Chris LeDoux,"I was sittin' the a bar-room one rainy afternoon
Tellin' stories about rodeo and listening to a tune
The rodeo starts tomorrow in this one horse town
So Bill took our names and put our entries down

I went to the office the next day to see
What bareback horse I had and pay me fees
I looked on the list, but my name wasn't found
I thought Bill might have forgot to put me down

I looked on the board and I happened to find
My name was on another list - I was in the bull ridin'
My knees began to knock, and my face began to sweat
And I heaved and gagged on the rodeo office steps

Well, I may be a fool, but a coward I'm not
So I borrowed a bull rope with a bell in the knot
I walked in the arena with them other bull ridin' fools
And walked down to the chutes and found my bull

Then I put my rope in the middle of his back
I had some cowboy pull out the slack
And then I wrapped the tail around my hand and back and said
""Boy's, open the gate just a little bitty crack.""

Well the bull hit the gate with his head
And I could see over his hump that his eyes were red
He bailed out of there with a big snort and beller
And something inside of me told me I was yeller

Well the dust and hairs and flies come off his hump
It whisp to my nose as he made another jump
And the stink of it all was more than I could stand
So I jerked my wrap and opened my hand

Well he jumped in the air and made one more turn
As the rope slid through my hand it sure did burn
He flang me down in a great big heap and
Right in the middle of me he did leap

With his feet on my belly standin' in place
That dirty old bull blew snot in my face
So them damned old bulls you can run 'em in a chute
And put your ropes on them big galloots
But the closest you're gonna find me to their stinkin' hair
Is to help some other fool get flung in the air

Boy the next time I see Bill I'm gonna break his dang neck
Enter me in the bull ridin'
Shoot I think I'll enter him in the Barrel Racing

The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
And the storms gettin' angry I know that its so

It seems to be a twister as the clouds begin to cry
And there goes momma clothesline leavin' on the fly
Here come the rain drops ten thousand four
It's gonna wash away our little part of Colorado

The mules are gettin' restless its hard to keep them shy
Don't they know they've got to get us to the other side

And what little we're taking the wind wants it back

Chris LeDoux,"He was just a hometown cowboy his belly kind of fat
Acme boots up on his feet and a big you-roll-it hat
He entered in the bull riding he did it on a dare
To please his little sweetheart with the long blond hair

He borrowed himself a bull rope spurs and a riding glove
To prove he was no coward to the girl he loved
His bull was standing in the chute his girl was in the stands
Wating to hear the name of her brave young man

He climed down on the back of that big ol' Bramer bull
One of the veteran cowboys came and gave his rope a pull
Someone said are you ready boy he said I guess I am
The bull jumped out and turned back and flung him to the sand

The hometown girl had watched it all and wasn't to impressed
She started looking around for a real man from the west
She looked around the arena and standin' by the fence
Was a tallean cowboy with a big black hat and tight fittin Levi pants

It was Jim a fine young cowboy he rode Broncs and Bramer bulls
He rodeo them quite consistently so his pockets were always full
Somehow he happened to glance up in the stands
And he saw that pretty blond haired girl as she was watching him

Meanwhile the hometown cowboy was back behind the chute
Dabbing blood off his nose and dumpin' sand from his boots
He got himself together wiped some manure off his shirt
He knew his girl would sloothe him cause he was darn sure hurt

He saw his blood haired girlfriend as he rounded the main grandstand
And his poor heart sank as he saw her leaving with another man
So boys if you don't rodeo leave well enough alone
And don't take your girl to the pitching cause you may not take her home

To make money so I could live in luxury
But the life behind a desk in a building
Would be like a prison sentence to me

And my speech it may be crude to most you see
I guess that I was just born a dreamer
But in my life I relish pride and being free
My clothes are high heeled boots and a big hat
And the buckle on my belt I wear with pride
You might even find a snuff can in the pocket of these old wore out faded

And when it's time to ride Well I bear down and try
But when I play I go to some ol' crowded bar room
And get drunk & wild along with the other guys
Well I know it can't go on like this forever
And I maybe a fool just runnin' wild through life
But it's my life and I'll live it to the fullest
And I can look back and say that it was right
And some day when my rovin' days are finally all over
Well I can picture a little home down beside a stream
And with a son and his mother sittin' by me and with love I'll help him to
Strive to reach his dream.

And then she loaded up her lip with snuff

She can ride a bareback horse and she can really hook into a bull
She never misses her saddle bronc out and she rides it like a spurrin' fool
She team ropes with the best of them ties a calf in 9.3
She'll dogs steers just for fun and make a fool out of you and me
She's my snoose queen...

Chris LeDoux,"A rodeo's just a rodeo after riding several years
From ol' Cheyenne to Houston they never cause too much fear
But let me tell you about one that will chill your very soul
It happens in December when it's snowin' and it's cold
In Oklahoma City there's a building of concrete
It's where the toughest stock and men will gather and compete
The points have all been tallied and the stock has all been brought
We've got just two more hours cause it starts at eight o'clock
It's the Finals the NFR the Series of the sport
Hey rookie can you take ten head have you got the heart
You think you're a tough cowboy we'll find out in the end
When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen

The coliseum's quiet except for the sounds
Of cowboys getting ready and the workmen of the grounds
The cowboys ask each other, what each other's got
""Did you draw ol' Necklace or pluck old Double-Ought
The tension now is mounting as the crowd starts pouring in
A shiver goes all through me like from a cold cold wind
I hear the horses comin' runnin' down the alleyway
They're snortin' and a blowin' as men shut the sliding gates
It's the Finals the NFR...

We had too much time a while ago but not enough time now
The Anthem is now over the grand entry's going out
I sit there on my bronc I'm ready and I wait
I hear a chute gate open so I look out through the gate
A horse comes boiling out and blows up at the roof
And then there comes another kicking like a curly wolf
I hear the chute boss holler through the yelling of the crowd
He says there's one ahead of you so you'd better get screwed down
It's the Finals the NFR...

I nod my head, I'm in a daze the horse goes boiling out
I run my spurrs into his neck and then I drag 'em out
My mind is in a blur my eyes are seeing red
The flank catch slams into my back, his rump bangs on my head
From somewhere in the background I can hear a buzzer sound
My hand's jerked from the riggin and I crash into the ground
I stumble to my feet as I stagger to the wall
I wonder to myself is it really worth it all
It's the Finals the NFR...

Chris LeDoux,"Old Red was one of the orneriest yet
I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed

From Idaho a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain
And Billy had never been thrown

The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""

Old Red was wicked down there in the chute
He was kickin' and stompin' about
Billy dropped into the saddle with ease
And said, ""Turn him loose let us out""

Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Tryin' to get rid of the man of his back
But the man went wherever he'd go

Billy was rakin' old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doin' right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in

Old Red was bucking straight for the fence
Suddenly stopped in and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him

There was a hush in the crowd
For they knew this would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest
When they fell and under old Red Billy died

Old Red lay still no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell

Out in the west is the place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode",Old Red
Chris LeDoux,"It was dark and I was driving down a lonely Texas road
The night was hot and sleep pulled at my eyes
I was thinking bout the wild times and the women that I'd had
The deceitful things I'd done and those lies

When standin' in the shadows at the side of the road
Stood the figure of a withered old man
He wore a black bandana a ropin' stetson hat
With a two inch scarlet hat band

He held his wrinkled hand up as a sign to shut 'er down
So I pulled over and stopped at his side
He opened up the door slid in and sat down
And said my ain't it hot tonight

I studied this old man and it seemed mighty strange
For him to be out here all alone
And then he started talking and he told me many things
Of times that both of us had known

He told me of the wild life and the women that he'd known
How none of them had ever meant a thing
He told me of a black night much the same as this
Of the strange and awesome things he'd seen
A man beside the road had raised his hand
And flagged him down so he stopped and let him in
That stranger told him stories that I am hearing now
Bout the wild times and all the sin

And the car got cold and clammy and this old man looked at me
He said boy I've come here for you
Your days of wicked sinnin' have come to an end
As a mortal on this earth you are through

Then his eyes got red and firey as he took his stetson off
To reveal his evil horns shiney and black
My God the fear came o'er and my senses were all lost
I fought with him until we finally crashed

Next day they found the car at the bottom of the draw
The young cowboy was found beside the wreck
The car had been consumed by fire
But the cowboy had no marks
Except the smokin' pitchfork brand upon his neck",The Passenger

By god what it that I hear, is it a siren, 
Sure enough he got me on his radar
He pulled up behind me and turned on those flashing lights a sign that I knew 

Meant pull it over
So I stomped on my brakes and as I skidded to a halt, 
I wiped out three 
Reflector posts along the shoulder
He got out of his car and was a walking real slow 
So I jumped out and met him 

Half-way
He jerked out his gun and said mister are you crazy, 
I ain't never seen nobody 
Drive that way
I told him take it easy and he could put up that cannon 
The way he was shaking 

It just might go off
He put up the gun as I explained my situation 
He listened to my story then he coughed
He wrote me out a ticket, that seemed to take forever. 
I took it and as I 

Headed for my car
That cop he hollered after me and said hey cowboy 
You better slow down cause 
You can't outrun this radar!
As I rolled on down the road I was a cursing 
About the ticket that I had just acquired

I wondered if I ought to pay it our just throw it out the window, but I might 
Just set the damn thing afire
So I gunned it once again and was a traveling down the highway with the gas 
Pedal a mashed to the floor

When I came around a curve and right there in the highway there was more damn 
Sheep than I ever seen before 
I'm going to fast to ever stop, so I just close my eyes as the car rolls on 
Through the herd

When I opened up my eyes again there's a sheep on the fender and that and that 
Herds saying some mighty awful words 
The sweats a dripping off my hands as I barrel through old Wheatland I'm a 
Nervous wreck and I must be a sight 

The flies inside this old car are buzzing all around me 
Guess my 24-hour deodorant quit last night 
60 50 40 30 20 miles more the rodeo starts in another 18 minutes 
I pull in through the main gate and I hear the anthem playing, 

I can't believe it thank God I finally made it 
There's only one more obstacle a standing in my way. 
Its a nitwit with a weekend badge 
He standing by the gate and as I slide her to a halt, 

He yells where in the hell you going so dog gone fast 
I tell him that I'm entered and I ain't got time to talk 
My horse is in the chute and I'm late 
He says I need to get a pass from the secretary my eyes get red my heart fills 

Up with hate. 
I yell you dirty so and so you better let me through he asked if I'd repeat 
That once again 
So I whacked him in the mouth and a left him lying there on his back a kicking 

In the sand 
I got there just in time to see my Bronc come running out his head and tail was 
A held way up high 
I swear he looked right straight at me and grinned and gave horse laugh and me 
I just stood there and cried I turned around feeling helpless and fairly 

Dumbfounded I looked and what did I see 3 highway patrolmen 
And a gate man with a fat lip 
And  they were all a looking right at me 
Sitting in the cell now I've done a lot of thinking 
About that wild run I made a month ago 

I'm sorry that I'm in this rotten situation 
If I could do it again I wouldn't have drove so slow

Chris LeDoux,"Since I saw that rodeo in 1965
I had to try to be the greatest bareback rider alive
I went and did some practicing on pa's old ropin' mare
And I thought I'd take that bronc I'd drawed
And really part it's hair
When they opened up the gate he did a double flip

Half way through the second one is when I lost my grip
I hooked my spurs into the dees and hung with all my might
I held my breath he chinned the moon
And sucked back to the right
My boots came off and went asailin' right up in the stands
My belt it broke and shattered my watch I lost my wedding band
I scattered all my cigarettes my shirt ripped down the back.
I sure was gettin' dizzy and I thought my neck would crack
I rode him several jumps with both hands high up in the air
He jumped into an old light pole we parted company there
I landed in some muddy slop he stomped right through my side,
I knew he busted all my ribs and made me wanna die

Nothin' ever busted me like that old pony ride
I couldn't seem to catch my breath I couldn't seem to hide
I hobbled back barefooted just a searchin' for my pride

And I just couldn't believe my achin' ears

Chris LeDoux,"Old Badger was an outlaw that no man could ever ride
So tough the devils pitch fork couldn't penetrate his hide
To beat him was the dream of every cowboy in the land
But try they might as sure is right they'll wind up in the sand

A brag came up from Texas by the name of Too Oaks Tall
Was out to get old Badger cause old Too Oaks rode 'em all
He said he'd tie a granny knot in Badger's twisting tail
So thousands came to stake his claim or to see how bad he'd fail

A mighty crowd had gathered with old Badger in the cute
The stirrups felt the boating weight of Too Oaks heavy boots
Then the cute swang open and the crowd began to roar
Cause shirt tail feet upon the seat like waves upon a shore

They circled that area Badger pawing out his hate
But Tall stuck in the saddle like his tail was made of paste
Badger then exploded as his hooves beat on the air
But Tall did stay like children's play in grandmas rockin' chair

The outlaw's eyes were blazin' and old Talls face was turnin' red
They take off to the right but wind up goin' left instead
They busted through the fence and crashed the stillness of the night
They filled the air with dust and hair and vanished out of sight

Some say they died of thirst and time turned them into stone
Others say they withered and buzzards picked their bones
But somewhere on that prairie is a scene we all ain't saw

Chris LeDoux,"Let me tell you a tale and a good one I own of an old caballo a strawberry roan
I was hangin' round town just a spendin' my time out of a job and not earnin' a dime
When a stranger steps up and he says
I suppose you're a bronc rider by the looks of your clothes
I says guess your right there's none I can't tame
If its ridin' wild ponies that my middle name
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
He says he's a cayuse that's never been rode
The guy that gets on him is bound to get throwed
Throwed of that strawberry roan

Out in the horse corral standin' alone is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
Spavined old legs and small pigeon toes pair of pig eyes and a long Roman nose
Little pin ears and they're split at the tip a big forty four brand was on his left hip
So I puts on my spurs and I coils up my twine
Says to that stranger that ten spot is mine
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
I'll break him to saddle or break him my own
I'll ride him until he lies down with a grown
Bring on your strawberry roan

Then I puts on my blinds and it sure is a fight
Next comes the saddle I screws her down tight
Steps up aboard him and rises the blind get out the way boys he's gonna unwind
Shore is a broad walker he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings for to be on the fly
He's the worse buckin' bronco I've seen on the range
Turn on a nickle and give you some change
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
That sunfishin' critter's worth leavin' alone
There's nary a buster from Texas to Nome
Can ride that strawberry roan




",Strawberry Roan
Chris LeDoux,"He walked out in the arena all dressed up to the brim
Said he just came down from a place called Highland Rim
And he said he came to ride the horse the one they called the Brute
But he didn't look like a cowboy in the continental suit

We snickered at the way he dressed but he never said a word
Walked on by the rest of us as if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born than the one they called the Brute

The horse that he was lookin' for was in chute number eight
Walked up very slowly put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a purebred when he pulled a sack o' Deuce
From the inside pocket of his continental suit

He rolled himself a quirly and he lit it standin' there
Blew himself a smoke ring and he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy as he opened up the gate
Standin' just inside was fifteen hundred pounds of hate

The buckskin tried to run him down but the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms around the horse's neck
And he pulled himself upon the back of the horse they called the Brute
Sat like he was born there in his continental suit

The Brute's hind end was in the air his front end on the ground
Kickin' and a squealin' tryin' to shake the stranger down
But the stranger wouldn't give an inch he came to ride the Brute
He came to ride that buckskin in a continental suit

I turned around to look at Jim but he was watchin' me
Said I don't believe the crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw the one they call the Brute
Ridden by a cowboy in a continental suit

The Brute came to a standstill ashamed that he'd been rode
By some city cowboy in some continental clothes
The stranger took his money and we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from and we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes could be a millionaire

Chris LeDoux,"Just about two hundred years ago they signed that declaration
Tellin' everybody in the whole wide world
They're gonna start a brand new nation
From that day on the 4th of July has been a holiday
To the rich man, poor man, and everybody else but the cowboys in the RCA
Well I get on the phone and call the airlines
Rent-a-cars and Greyhound stations
Cause I've entered bout thirteen rodeos out across the great big nation
Got the car tuned up
The tanks full of gas
I've got money in my hand
And if I ain't overdrawn by the end of the week
At the bank I'm a lucky man

It's the 4th of July on the rodeo trail
It'll drive you insane

I'm on the road again
It's the Forth of July on the rodeo trail if I ever make it home I swear
I'm gonna to hang up my hat
Put up my riggin' sack
And for a month I'm gonna stay right there

Well I've been on the road about three days now
And I haven't had a minutes rest
There's dark circles all around my bloodshot eyes
And my face is now a whiskered mess
Boy I'd sure like a bath and a home cooked meal
But for now I must be satisfied
With this double super-duper half cooked burger
And a side of grease soaked french fries
Well the week's nearly over and I wonder to myself will I ever make it home alive
When a bronc fell on me up in Calgary
When he slipped tryin' to make his high dive
And the plane and the pilot that we rented looked like surplus from World War I
And I thought any times about suicide
But I haven't found myself a gun

Old Sandy Bob and Buster Jiggs had a roundup camp last fall
Oh, they'd taken the horses and the runnin' irons and may be a dog or two
And they swore they'd brand all long ear calves that came within their view
And any old doggie that flapped long ears and didn't brush up by day
Got his long ears whittled and his old hid scorched in a most artistic way
Now one fine day old Sandy Bob he throwed his easy go down
Well I'm sick of the smell of this here burnin' hair and allows I'm a goin' to town
[ harmonica ]
So they saddles up and they hits 'em a lope for it weren't no sign of a ride
And them was the days when a buckaroo could oil up his insides
Oh they starts her off at Kentucky Bar at the head of a whiskey row
And they winds up down at the depot house some forty drinks below
And then sets up and turns around and goes her the other way
And to tell you the god forsaken truth them boys got stewed that day
As they was a ridin' back to camp a packin' a pretty good load
Well who should they meet but the devil himself a prancin' down the road
[ guitar ]
Say he you ornery cowboy skunks you better hunt your holes
For I've come up from hells Rim Rock to gather in your souls
Says Sandy Bob old devil be damned we boys is kinda tight
And ya ain't gonna get no cowboy souls without one hell of a fight
So Snady Bob punched a hole in his rope and he swang her straight and true
And he lapped it onto the devils' horns and he taken his dallies too
Now Buster Jiggs was a reita man with his gut line coiled up neat
So he shakes her out and he built him a loop and he lassoed up the devil's hind feet
[ harmonica ]
Well they stretched him out and they tailed him down while the iron was gettin' hot
And they cropped and swallow forked both his ears and they branded him up a lot
They pruned him up whit a dehorning saw and they knotted his tail for a joke
And then rode off and left him there neck to a blackjack oak
So if your ever up high in the Sierra peaks and you hear one hell of a wail
You'll know it's that devil a bellerin' about them knots tied in his tail

Chris LeDoux,"I saw her for the first time when the snow was falling down
And Lord she was the cutest thing I've ever seen
Great big green eyes a flashin' ruby lips a smilin'
Well my heart went pitter patter and I knew it was gonna shatter
If I couldn't make that little gal my own
You can sing about your sweet Joly Blon
You can sing about them pretty gals down in Tennessee
You can sing your song about that Yellow Rose of Texas
But the one by the Powder River that runs through old Kaycee
That Wyoming girls the only one for me

I've been around this big country and I've seen a lot of women in my time
Well there ain't none sweeter and there ain't none better
Than this little gal I call mine and I thank you Lord for making her my wife
You can sing about...

Chris LeDoux,"Just a broken down cowboy 
All down on his luck 
Been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway 
In an old pick-up truck 
Cross Texas like a hot dusty wind

He was All Around Cowboy back in forty-nine
From the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and the women started winning his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground

He remembers the thrill of being a winner
And the days of his first rodeo
There's something 'bout winnin' that don't last forever
Maybe tomorrow things will get better
If the devil lets loose of his soul
He'll be the All Around Cowboy again

So he rolls up a smoke 
And he sips his Old Crow 
Wipes the whiskers that cover his chin 
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeos
He's the All Around Cowboy again

He remembers the thrill of being a winner
And the days of his first rodeo 
There's something 'bout winnin' that don't last forever
Maybe tomorrow things will get better
If the devil lets loose of his soul
He'll be the All Around Cowboy again

Chris LeDoux,"I was snappin' out broncs at the Old Flyin' you
At forty a month a plum good buckaroo
Well, the boss comes around and he says, hey my lad
Well, you look pretty good ridin' horses that's bad

You see, I ain't got no more outlaws to break
But I'll buy you a ticket and I'll give you a stake
At ridin' them bad ones, well, you ain't slow
And you might do some good at the big rodeo

While they're puttin' the bull in the chute
I'm strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
I looks that bull over and to my surprise
Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes

On top of his shoulders, he's got a big hump
I cinched up my rigging just back of that lump 
I lands in his middle and I lets out a scream
He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream

Well, he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
But I ain't no green horn, I'm still sittin' tight
The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin
He's a wavin' them horns right under my chin

At sunnin' his belly, he couldn't be beat
He's a showin' the buzzards the soles of his feet
He's a dippin' so low that my boots filled with dirt
He's a makin' a whip of the tail of my shirt

He's a snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes
He's a buckin' and a bawlin' and a blowin' his nose
The crowd starts to cheerin' both me and that bull
Well, he needed no help but I had my hands full

Then he goes to fence rowin' and weavin' behind
My head went poppin', I sorta went blind
He starts in high divin', I lets out a groan
We went up together but he come back alone

Up high I turns over and below I can see
He's a pawin' up dirt just a waitin' for me
I can picture a grave and a big slab of wood
Sayin' here lies a twister who thought he was good

I notices somethin' don't seem can be true
But the brand on his hip was a Big Flyin' you
When I landed, he charged but I got enough sense
So I ran that old bull to the hole in the fence

I dives through that hole and I want you to know
I ain't goin' back to no big rodeo
At a straddlin' them Brahmas, you can bet I'm all through

Where the mighty Franklin Mountains guard the trail to Mexico

And listend to the music of a hillbilly band
And danced with your darlin' all through the night
And don't go home til the morning light

Laughter and dancin' a huggin' and a kissin'
Everybody there's just havin' a ball

There's bald headed men and old fat women
Kids in their teens and little bitty children
So put on your boots and stomp on the floor
And have more fun than ever before
Man we're really havin' a ball

Chris LeDoux,"The winter wind was blowin' when we loaded that old truck
With a few things that we had and all our dreams.
With my new bride there beside me we headed down the road
I would show her places and things she'd never seen

First we went to Denver, fort worth, then San Antone
She cheered me on at every rodeo,
But Houston finally ended and then San Angelo
I didn't want to tell her but she knew that we were broke.

Chorus

But she never complained when the winnin's didn't come
She just took it all in stride,
And if I rode good or bit the dust, she was just as proud
She was happy bein' by my side

Then in California the baby started showin'
And all her clothes were gettin' way too small
We couldn't spare the money to buy her any new ones
She just wore my shirt and jeans and didn't mind at all.


And early in the mornin' we'd wake up by the roadside
I'd build a fire and she'd get out the eggs
She'd cook us up some breakfast then we'd sit down there on the grass
Lord, those were the best meals I guess I ever ate.

Chorus

Well now those days are over, and somehow we got ahead
That little gal I married's still here with me
We finally got the house we planned down there beside the stream
And all those old hard times are just cherished memories.

To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young lady
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away

CHORUS
I said, Hey, little girl
Don't you know he's a devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his shadow to blame
And some people swear he's my double
And some even say we're the same
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We'll take our own chances and pay our own dues
The silver tongued devil and I

Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cause she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone

Chris LeDoux,"Now old Jake was a cowboy he'd worked his whole life on the range
And he could rope, and he could ride with any man just half his age
Old Jake was my hero and me I was just a green kid
And I prayed that someday I could do all the things old Jake did
Well we sat around the bunk house one cold and lonely winter's night
Just chewin' and talkin' and smokin' by the coal oil light
Well old Jake had been aweful quiet that evenin' and he stared hard and long
He said young puncher you goin' to remember me after I'm gone
Whatever happens to old cowboy heros like me
A broken down part of a man I used to be
Will I be forgotten or live on in your memory
Whatever happens to old cowboy heros like me

It's been a long time and oh how the years fade away

Nighttime is rolling my way
The sky's all on fire and the light's slowly fadin'
Peaceful and still ends the day

And out on the trail, the night birds are callin'
Singin' their wild melody
Down in the canyon, the cottonwood whispers
A song of Wyoming for me

I've wandered around the town and the city
Tried to figure the how and the why
I've stopped all my schemin'
I'm just driftin' and dreamin' and watching the river roll by

And here comes that big ole prairie moon risin'
Shinin' down bright as can be
And up on the hill there's a coyote singin'
A song of Wyoming for me

Well now it's whiskey and tobacco and bitter black coffee
A lonesome old doggie am I
Waking up on the range, Lord, I feel like an angel
Free like I almost could fly

Drift like a cloud out over the badlands
Sing like a bird in the tree

Chris LeDoux,"When I was a lad an old cowboy told me well son you're sure ridin' well
There's fame and there's fortune
And glory waitin' at the end of the rodeo trail
So I packed up my stuff in my old pickup truck to follow my rodeo dreams
Now I'm finally on the top but I feel like a flop
Cause I've spent all the fortune I've seen
Now where is the glory in drivin' all night
Down a highway that's headed to nowhere
What good's the fame when the fortune's all gone
And the dreams turned into a nightmare
Like Ed Bruce said Mamma's don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
I'm inclined to agree but if you ask me you know I'd go through it again

Now what does it take to be a rodeo cowboy I guess I'm a expert at that
Takes a whole lot of guts and old lady luck but not too much under this hat
Well he thrives on the crowds yellin' real load for him to face dyin' again
But the good Lord takes care of children and fools
He's no kid so what's that make him

But I don't like that farmin' at all
It's goodby for the summer this haying's sure a bummer
And I'll be back to help you gather in the fall
Well I don't mind riding fences but them tractors are wrenches
I ain't never liked and I guess I never will
Just give me my horse and saddle or some woolies or some cattle
And turn me loose and let me ride out through the hills
Cause I'm just a cowboy a dirt and sweat cowboy
Livin' on beef steak and beans
I ain't to hard to please but Mister you better believe
I ain't never had no use for farm machines

Well there ain't much romancing in old fashioned branding
But Lorrie it suits me just fine
Oh the dust and the smoke's enough to make a feller choke
But have you ever had to ride one of them old combines
Now my grandpa was a farmer a Michigan black land farmer
And he worked with them machines the whole day through
But I bet if he did some roaming through the hills of old Wyoming
He'd probably feel about the same way that I do

I reckon it's just bad fate I was born a hundred years too kate
And they say boy if you want to survive you'd better change
But as long as sagebrush grows and that old Powder River flows
I'll be a cowboy till my dyin' day
I'm just a cowboy...
Well I think I just heard a discouraging word
About them rattleing banging smoking farm machines

Buckin' broncs Brahma bulls is just some wishful thinkin'
Cause that cowboy well he's still too young to ride
Leather chaps a big white hat silver spurs that glisten
Growin' up takes such a long long time
And he could ride the rankest bronc if only they would listen
How that cowboy's dreams sound a lot like mine
Dream on cowboy your trophy buckles're waitin'
You got the world by the reins and you've got time on your side
Dream on cowboy there's not a thing in your way now
So don't wait 'til it's too late to saddle your dreams and ride

Lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days

I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well your best days are gone

Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, an' old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

Between his knees was a raging black stallion

Cause his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Meant more to him than life
Cause this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife

And looked up the stranger there
When he bought her some drinks, and he gave her some money
But she just didn't seem to care

And he laughed when she grabbed for the bay
Well he shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Chris LeDoux,"Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone
It was long late in the evening when he rode into our camp
On a little old brown pony he called Shaw
In his brogan shoes and coveralls a harder lookin' kid
You never in you life have seen before

His saddle was a Sother kack built many years ago
An OK spur on one foot idly hung
With his bed roll in a cotton sack was loosely tied behind
And a canteen from the saddle horn he'd slung
Said he had to leave his home because his paw had married twice
His new maw beat him every day or two
So he saddled up old Shaw one night and lit a shuck this way
Thought he'd try and paddle now his own canoe

Said he'd try to do the best he could if we'd only give him work
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow
So the boss he cut him out a mount and kinda put him on
And we knew he liked our little stray somehow
Well he taught him how to heard the horses and learned to know 'em all
And to get 'em in by daylight if he could
And to follow the chuck wagon and to always hitch the team
And to help the carsonaro rustle wood

We had driven to Red River and the weather it was fine
We were camped down on the south side of the bend
When a Norther started blowin' we called the extra guard
Cause it took all hands to hold the cattle in
Now little Joe the wrangler was called out like the rest
Barely had the kid got to the heard
When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they flew
With all of us a ridin' for the lead

Between the streaks of lightnin' we could see a horse ahead
It was little Joe the wrangler in the lead
He was riding old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head
And he's trying to check the leaders in their speed.
We finally got'em millin' and they sort of quieted down
The extra guard back to the camp did go
But one of them was missing and we all knew at a glance
Twas our little Texas strayboy wrangler Joe

We found him there at sun up where old Blue Rocket fell
In some washout twenty feet below
Beneath his horse smashed to a pulphis spur had rung the knell
For our little Texas stray bos wrangler Joe
Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone

From poker games and painted ladies

And when my hard-earned pay is gone
I climb up and just hold on

And so I whistle ""Back

Chris LeDoux,"Well I've never been afraid of much and never thought I need a crutch
To help me through the trials of this life
But there's one thing I can't do with out and Copenhagens what I'm talkin'
About and I love it nearly as much as I love my wife
Now when I first started chewin' I didn't know what I was doin'
But I liked the way it helped me to relax
And a big ol' chew tastes might good just the way I know Copenhagen should
But when its gone I'm a slobbering maniac
I'm a Copenhagen junkie there's a big ol' hairy monkey on my back
And it just won't let me be
Cause when I run out of chewin' I know I'm on the road to ruin
That Copenhagen's got a hold on me

I can go without a lot of things like sweet potatoes and butter beans
And you know if wouldn't really bother me at all
I can go without coffee for a couple of days but if you take my s'noose away
I'll be climbing like the spider up the wall
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...

Well I even tried to quit one time my knees got weak I sorta went blind
And my mellow disposition headed south
I started eating like a big fat hog got wild got mean like a rabid dog and
Start frothin' and foamin' at the mouth
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...

Can I help you sir ah yeah do you got any Copenhagen
No Sir I'm afraid we're all out ah
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...
Ah Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
But when its gone boys I ain't feeling exactly the way I should



",Copenhagen Junkie
Chris LeDoux,"Well now cowboys love the ladies they like beans and sour dough
Good horses and hot black coffee and camp fires burnin' low
You know we love that cowboy music but I'll bet you didn't know
That even cowboys like just a little rock and roll

Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Buddy Holly in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll

Now when you're camped out on the prairie and that ole moon is shinin' bright
And you can hear them cattle bawlin' soft and low
There's nothin' like a cowboy song to make it all feel just right
But even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Chuck Berry in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll

Now those old buckaroos are set in their ways and they'll even tell you so
Say they don't like nothin' but them old time cowboy songs
Yeah but I've seen that green grass growin' underneath that winter snow
I'll bet them old cowboys even like a little rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Charlie Daniels in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll

Yeah there's a little long hair in every single cowboy that I know
And even cowboy's like a little bit of rock and roll

Chris LeDoux,"Discouraged is the word these days at homes acros the range
The livestock markets down and it don't look like it's gonna change
Nobody's found a cure for what we are goin' through
But I'll tell you boys just what I'm gonna do
Well I'm gonna saddle up old paint right after shipping time
Ride out on the mountain among the aspens and the pines
Take along my fishing pole and leave my cares behind
And find myself a little piece of mind
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain live like a mountain man
Lay my body on the ground eat from a fryin' pan
I know it's not the answer but I'm gonna try to lose
These dog gone low down workin' cowboy blues

Well next year it might get better aw that's what they always say
But I've seen a string of next years come and Lord they're all the same
But as long as there's a mountain, someplace to get away
Well this old cowboy just might not go insane
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain...

Chris LeDoux,"Headed for Wyoming, in 1882..a woman, a team, and a wagon.
Gonna make our dreams come true.
Settled in the foothills of the big horn mountain slope.
Life is sweet we lived on the meat, of the deer and the antelope.
We cut house logs on the mountain, with the team we hauled 'em down.
Peeled 'em and we stacked 'em up, for a house and bought some ground.
Traded for some cattle, and turned 'em out on the range.
The skies were blue and we never knew...how things were gonna change.
Ole powder river, you're muddy and wide, how many men have died...upon
Your shores.
When you brand a man a rustler, he's gotta take a side.
There's no middle ground in this Johnson country war.
Well, the neighbors stopped by yesterday, while I was outside choppin'
Some wood.
And they filled me in on the local news, ain't none of it sounded good,
Said, they'd been some cattle stealin', by some no count outlaw bands.
We'd all been branded rustler's by the big ranchers of this land.
Well it was us against the cattlemen, and the years just made it worse.
First the drought, then the tough winter, Johnson county had been dealt
A curse,
Then their came the story about the two dry golgia tax.
Ranger Jones and John Tisdale both been shot in the back
Oh, powder river, you're muddy and you're wide,
How many men have died upon your shores.
When you brand a man a rustler, he's gotta take a side.
There's no middle ground in this Johnson county war.
Then last night at supper time, riders stopped by chance.
They said cattleman and hired guns, just burned the Kaycee ranch,
Two men had died this mornin', shot down in the snow.
Now the vigilante army was marchin' for buffalo.
Well the county was in an uproar, an every man saddled up to ride.
Caught the cattlemen at the ta ranch, and surrounded all four sides.
We hailed the house with bullets and swore we'd make 'em pay.
But the cavalry came across the plains, and once again saved the day.
Well, they marched 'em off to Cheyenne, and no one went to jail.
The cattlemen we're all turned loose, and the hired guns hit the trail.
And I guess the only justice, wasn't much to say the least.
Last winter me and mine ate mighty fine on the cattle baron's beef.
Oh powder river, you're muddy and you're wide.
How many men have died upon your shores.
When you brand a man a rustler, he's gotta take a side.

Chris LeDoux,"I was waltzin' with my darlin' at the cattleman's ball.
Lost in the music and her charms.
I was glidin' around the dance floor, she felt so good in my arms.
When a tall dark stranger walked up, and cut in.
He said, excuse me sir, why don't you go have a seat.
I said well listen' here pardner, this may sound kinda crude,
But the lady is dancin' with me.
Now I paid for the supper, an' I bought the drinks,
So I feel that I've got the right,
Now I'm sorry ole buddy, but you just better back off,
Or there's liable to be trouble here tonight.
Now I can see that you're upset, 'cause it's always been a tradition,
To let a fine young gentleman cut in,
But if you don't take your hands off my lady, pardner,
I'm gonna have to break your chin.
Now, I've seen your kind before and I know,
Exactly what's on your mind.
Your woman probably left you, for someone else,
So you thought you'd just take a run at mine.
Yeah, you though you'd be leavin' her later on,
That's right it's all part of the game.
Why don't you take my advice and on go back to the bar,
In one piece, the same way you came in.
The stranger took off and I saw him tryin' with someone else.
An' my lady well, she scowled at me,
An' she said, you know I think that was very uncouth,
And goes against all the rules of chivalry.
Then she smiled up at me, with those beautiful eyes,
An' said, mister, you know I kinda like your style,
But do you think we should call up the sitter and check on the kids? 
I just grinned and said, naw let's just dance a while.",The Lady Is Dancing With Me
Chris LeDoux,"Well the sun came up this mornin', my ain't it a beautiful day.
Heard that highway callin', time to be on our way.
Girl I never seen the sun shine brighter, I need you to be my rainbow
Rider.
Your sweet smile can keep all the clouds at bay,
So get up, we can use a holiday.
We're gonna drive up on the mountain, clear up to the timber line.
Sleep out in the moonlight, way up their among the pines.
In a grassy meadow with the stars up above you.
I'm gonna show you how much I love you.
We're gonna leave all our worries and cares behind.
So come on rainbow rider, time to rise and shine.

Find a celebration, and listen to the guitars play.

Chris LeDoux,"There's a place on the yukon river, called the carriboux saloon.
Where the miners go, to spend their gold,
An' listen to the sad, sweet tune.
Feast their eyes' upon the beauty of the lovely yukon rose,

They can look but they better not touch her, she belongs to pierre
Leboux.
They say he found down in seattle, won her at a young and tender age.
Now she sings up here, while the men drink beer,

Like a bird in a guilded cage.
Well, one time a man from tulsa challenged pierre for her rose's hand,
Now he lies below the the bitter snow in this wild and savage land.
Some nights when the northern lights are shinin'

And the cold north wind is howlin' across the snow.
Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'...or could it be the sound of
The yukon rose.
Then one night a bigfoot just happened to be passin' by.

And there in the dark his heart his lonely heart,
Was touched by rose's lulaby.
So he walked into the bar room and every one turned to stare,
But he looked to them just like a bearded man, in a coat of grizzly

Hair.
Bigfoot saw the yukon rose and their eyes meet through the gloom.
An' she was hypnotized by his gentle eyes, and was drawn across the
Room.

Now they say that love has no bounderies, an' I reckon that it's right,
'Cause beauty and the savage beast, fell in love that night.
Some nights when the northern lights are shinin',
An' the cold north winds are howlin' 'cross the snow,

Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'...
Or could it be the song of the yukon rose...
Now pierre was in the back room, dealin' cards when the music stoped.
He laid his hand down and looked around, and said nobody touch that pot.

He walked out to the bar room and the trouble began,
An' his blood ran cold when he saw the rose, in the arms of the tall
Strange man.
Pierre walked up and he grabbed her, an' shoved her t'wards the stage,

And the gentle look in the strangers eyes, turned wild and red with
Rage.
An' then with just one mighty blow, pierre lay on the saw-dust floor.
The tall strange man, took the ladies hand, an' walked out through the
Door.

No one dared to follow, and where he took her no one knows,
But we all jumped back, when we saw the tracks. of bigfoot in the snow.
Some say she probably died that winter, she must have I s'pose.
But just last night under the northern lights,

I heard the song of the yukon rose.

And the cold north wind is howlin' across the snow,

At that big Rodeo in Cheyenne.
Feelin' tired and sore for a ride the day before,
And a thousand other rides since I began.

As I climbed up the gate I heard that young cowboy sayin',
Well, that ole man ain't gonna ride, and I had to smile.
I said son it ain't age that makes me look this way,
It ain't the years boy...it's the miles.

It ain't the years that I've known that have taken their toll,
'Cause they've been few.
If you took all the mashin's, the draggin's and the crashin's,

It's the million miles of road, and gettin' snatched around and throwed,
That finally put the cramp in my style.
It ain't the years boy...it's the miles.
Went on and made my ride, only scored a 65.

But you know what really made my day complete,
Was when I looked up just in time to see that young cowboy goin' flyin',
And land in a pile at my feet.
And as the first aid came to haul him away, I said son you'll be

To watch his dad work the young horse they called Smokey man did that horse buck
But his old dad just sat up there and rode him like there was nothin' to it
Right then the boy gained a whole new respect for the man
And from that day on he knew that when he grew up he wanted to be a cowboy

Seventeen cowboys' dreams ain't on fixin' fences
Once he's seen 'em ride in old Cheyenne
Ranch routine and his old man's schemes
This ain't where his heart is but you know his daddy understands
Noonday comes father and son sit down and eat their dinner
Beneath that big Wyoming sky
His daddy knows he's gotta let him go the boy can't be a winner
If he don't spread his wings and fly
And in his mind he's riding bulls down in Las Vegas
Soon he'll be on a train that leads to Santa Fe
Sweet voice of freedom echoes down the ages calls another cowboy on his way

Fencin's done and the morning sun finds him packed and ready
Momma kissed his cheek and then she went inside
His old man well he shook his hand said son you ride 'em pretty
Didn't see the tears that his momma cried
And in his mind he's riding...

Well I don't see nothin' to hold you back just pack your stuff and go
You'll travel many highways and boy you're gonna see it all
You'll have yourself some good times but you're gonna take some falls
Now lay off the hard liquor leave them pills alone
They'll only dull the senses and leave you weak and stoned
If you wanna be a winner son you better play it straight
Give it everything you got when they open up the gate
Well there ain't no easy goin on the rodeo trail
For every man that's made it a hundred men have failed
But if you're mighty lucky and you gotta lot of try
There's a big gold buckle waitin at the end of the line

Now if you got a woman son you better know her well
Cause it takes a special lady to follow you through hell
But if she'll stand beside you when you're down to your last dime
You've got yourself a treasure that few men ever find
Well there ain't no easy...

Traditions are holding on you'll be glad to hear
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
Like that young cowboy from old Montana got boots and spurs and a black bandana
He rides the wild prairie rounding up the steers
Just like his Daddy he's a son of The Pioneers
From Texas clear up the Idaho from the mountains to the plains
They got the blood of Crockett and Geronimo flowing through their veins
Now the wild old west is changing some but traditions persevere
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers

There's a gal down in Texas with a great big hat
She likes roping and dancing and things like that
And if you need a hand at your branding she'll volunteer
She's a wild prairie flower and a daughter of the Pioneers
He's got braids and hat with an eagle feather
He rides with broncs there ain't none better
And his great grandaddy was a chief on the wild frontier
And he's a proud son of the original Pioneers

All this romance can drive a poor cowboy insane
And that lonesome coyote's a howlin' on the prairie
And that big Wyoming moon is shinnin' down
Well it's Saturday night and you know its customary
For a wild and wooly cowboy to ride to town

Well I just got paid and my pockets are full of money
I can't stand no more I can't wait another day
I got to ride to town I gotta see my little green eyed honey

All the old familiar landmarks seem like long lost friends
As he pulls in to the ranch he see's his mom hangin' out the wash
And dad is ridin' down the old yellow with old smokie
He never realized what a good cook his mom was
I guess he took a lot of things for granite
But for the past year he has been living on blogne burgers and beans
And he thinks he just might stay home for awhile
Well there's a dance in town tonight
And he figures he'll just go in and see some of his old friends
Well he runs into Bill and John and they ask
Where all he's been and about the bulls
Well then from behind him he hears someone call his name
He turns around to see a beautiful young lady
He doesn't recognise him at first but then it dawns on him
This is the same skinny little girl who use to tag along with him back in high school
My how the flowers grow well they danced and talked about things
And somewhere around midnight for the first time in his life
The cowboy realizes he is fallin' in love
And you know what I guess it was bound to happen

and why do you rope for short pay
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And you're loosin' your share

Why does he ride for his money
And tell me why does he rope for short pay
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And he's loosin' his share
Well he must've gone crazy out there

Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing

Well I read up the last of my letter
And tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and grinned

He said you know I wonder
Why do they ride for their money
Tell me why do they ride for short pay
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And they're loosin' their share
Son, they all must be crazy out there

They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing

Chris LeDoux,"(Put your hands together and start making some noise
And let's do the same when we get them on stage
Ladies and gentleman let's give it up for the wild and wooly saddle boogie band)

I rode in to town today in my mind I said Lord I'd love to stay
Somethin' in me said boy move on
Don't know what it is Lord blessed it in my bones
And I'm searchin' for a rainbow and if the wind ever shows me where to go
You'll be waitin' at the end and I know
And I'll say to hell with that pot of gold
I'll say to hell with that pot of gold

This old mount I'm ridin' is gettin' kinda tired
But in my heart he knows there's just one desire
He's gonna take me to the end of the road
And he'll lay down and die and I'll say God rest his soul
And I'm searchin' for a rainbow...
And I'm searchin' for a rainbow...
And I'm searchin' for a rainbow...
I'll say to hell with that pot of gold




",Searching for a Rainbow
Chris LeDoux,"There's a silence on the prairie; that a man can't help but feel
Shadows growing longer now; Nipping at my heels
I know that soon that old four-lane; that runs beneath my wheels
Will take me home; to my Sweet Wyoming Home.

I headed down the road last summer; with a few good friends of mine
They all hit the money, Lord; I didn't make a dime.
The entry fees they took my dough; the travelin' took my time;
And I'm headed home; to my Sweet Wyoming Home

Watch the moon; smiling in the sky
Hum a tune; Prairie lullaby; 
Hear the wind; And old coyotes cry
A song of home; Sweet Wyoming Home

Now the rounders they all wish you luck; when they know you're in a jam
But your money's ridin' on the bull; and he don't give a damn
Well there's shows in all the cities; cities turn your heart to clay
Takes all a man can muster; just to try and get away
The songs I'm used to hearin'; ain''t the kind the jukebox play
And I'm headed home; To my Sweet Wyoming Home

Well I've always loved the ridin'; there ain' t nothing quite the same
Another year might bring me luck; win in another game
There's a magpie on a fence rail; that's callin' out my name
And he calls me home, To my Sweet Wyoming Home

Watch the moon; smiling in the sky
Hum a tune; Prairie lullaby; 
Hear the wind; And old coyotes cry
A song of home; Sweet Wyoming Home
It's a song of Home, Sweet Wyoming Home",Sweet Wyoming Home
Chris LeDoux,"Stared out just a young cowboy writin' songs on a cheap guitar
Melodies were kind of rough but you knew they came from the heart
But if not for you I'd never could have ever got this far
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know

From the days at the Terrace Ballroom well me made it up to Symphony Hall
I played my songs and you sang along and man we really had a ball
And you brought your little children and I've seen 'em all grow tall
Yeah I watched you grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know

And all the wild and wooly cowboys dancin' and yellin' for more
Your hats and suites an cowboy boots stompin' on a hardwood floor
And you qaltzed those Utah ladies beneath the spotlight glow
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know

Chris LeDoux,"I'm a goin and a blowin' and a heading down the road tryin' to make a livin rodeoin'
I've been a driving all night neath the pail moonlight
Waiting for the sun to start showin'
There's to many miles and not enough time but I'm gonna make it
Just the same well its a mighty tough life but I like it alright
You know I wouldn't have it any other way

Well I've been drinkin' that ol black coffee till it tastes like tupentine
And I've heard every song on the Bill Mack show purd near fifty times
And a little green man on a motorcycle passed a little while ago
Boy I can sure use some sleep but I gotta keep a headin on down the road

Lets drive up get out and get on another one and boy you better win
Cause your moneys gettin' low and the banker gets mad
When them hot checks start rolling in
Well ain't life great on this interstate a lookin' out for smokey the bear
And flyin high on caffeine and copenhagen and a breathing that cool night air
Well its a mighty tough life but I like it alright
You know I wouldn't have it any other way

Chris LeDoux,"Just a rodeo drifter, he comes and he goes,
Like a wild wind that blows in the night.
The highways and back roads are all that he knows,
He'll be gone with the mornin's grey light.

Like a blue norther howlin' like the tumbleweeds blow,
There's no way to settle him down.
His spirit's as wild as the horses he rides,
His freedom he wears like a crown.

[Chorus]
And he rides the wild horses,
The same blood flows through their veins.
Yes he rides the wild horses,
Like the horses he'll never be tamed.

He'll never be broke, he won't be tied down,
He'll never wear no man's brand.
He won't fit in with the nine to five crowd
'Cause movin's all he understands.

With a push and a pull

I got a date with a girl, a pretty ranchers daughter,
Green eyes and golden hair.
Gonna pick her up at 8 after some soap and water.

So I'm gonna take on the ferris wheel.
Way up in the sky, with the stars in her eyes,
I'm gonna tell her just how I feel.

Chris LeDoux,"Last night you told her
That you could never hold her,
'Cause a cowboy's just got to be free

And yours was aching,
But you saddled up and followed your dreams

Coffee on your campfire
Wind through the barbed wire
Your huddle close to the flame

Though she's far behind you
The night wind reminds you
It just keeps on whispering her name

You can make a run for the border
Try to hide at the hole in the wall
But don't you know your arms are aching to hold her
And cowboy even though your riding tall
Your riding for a fall

Midnight the moon's up
Hands around your tin cup.
Frost settles in on the sage

The nights gettin' colder
Oh man you're getting older
Tonight you're feeling your age

Why don't you turn back
Just saddle up and back track
You know you'll never find a love quite like hers

And on a cold lonesome evening
What the hell good's your freedom
Don't you think it's time you hung up your spurs

Then I met you and the next thing I knew 
There I was oh shot full of love

Well I was sittin' in a coffee shop
Just havin' a cup to pass the time
Swapin' rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine
When some motorcycle riders started snickerin' in the back

Started pokin' fun at my friend's hat
One ol' boy said ""Hey Tex where'd you park your horse?""
My friend just pulled his hat down low but they couldn't be ignored
One husky fella said ""I think I'll rip that hat right off your head.""
That's when my friend turned around and this is what he said

""You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat

""Now partner this old hat is better left alone
See it used to be my daddy's
But, last year he passed on
My nephew skined the rattler that makes up this ol' hatband
But, back in sixty nine he died in vietnam

Now the eagle feather was given to me by an indian friend of mine
But, someone ran he down somewhere around that Arizona line
And a real special lady gave me this hatpin
And I don't know if I'll ever see her again

""You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry

""now if your leather jaket means to you what this hat means to me
Then I guess we understand each other and we'll just let it be
But, if you still think it's funny, man you got my back up against the wall
And if you touch my hat you're gonna havta fight us all""

Well right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes
He turned back to the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside
But when my friend turned back towards me
I noticed he's ol' hatbrim
Well it was turned up in a big ol' Texas grin

Well, I'm faded and I'm wrinkled 
Tattered and stained with sweat

For drivin' an old John Deere

To buy a workin' man an ice-cold beer

And in the hand of a child I was laid on a plate

Get back on that pony and ride

So lift up your head boy I know how you're feeling
You say you won't ride with a chance you might lose
You fallen from love and your head is still reeling
Your heart and your pride have been shaken and bruised
And like Blaze she took off a running...

I'm not saying forget what you lost I suppose there's a purpose in pain
What we make of ourselves has a cost
And it's paid every time we take hold of the reins

So dust off your blue jeans get back in the saddle losing's a place to start over again
Gettin' back up there is half of the battle
And love like a pony should race with the wind
And like Blaze it takes off a running...

Chris LeDoux,"There's a full moon risin' in the prairie sky tonight
Lord it's good to be on my way home.
Over that hori[a]zon she keeps the home fires burin' bright
I'm goin' back to my powder river home.

[Chorus]
Where the river winds from the big horn's up above
And the clear moon shines on the prairie that I love
It's the closest place to heaven this cowboy's ever known
I'm goin' back to my powder river home.


Travelin' round the country for a dozen years or more
Funny how your point of view can change
I finally found the rainbow that I've been searchin' for
It's right above my home out on the range.

Chris LeDoux,"Well, I was lookin' for just a little bit more
Than just another pretty face
Someone who would be strong and true
If trouble ever came my way

Too many times, I've been left behind
When my back was up against the wall
But now I found someone who ain't gonna run
No matter how the dice may fall

She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground

When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough, she's tough

Well, she's soft and sweet and she's good to me
Even when times are bad
She picks me up with a gentle touch
Anytime I'm feelin' sad

Don't you know I'll never let her go
'Cause she makes it so plain to see
When love is real, it's strong as steel
And hers is all I'll ever need

She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground

When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough, she's tough

And I'm so glad that I'm her man
'Cause when the you know what starts to hit the fan

She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me

Chris LeDoux,"I rode off into the sunset
The way cowboys always do
But ten miles west of Fort Worth
My thoughts ran back to you

I could feel you there beside me
Taste your tender lips on mine
Hey there'll always be another bronc
But true love is hard to find

CHORUS
Last night I found a soft place to fall
Loving arms to ease me down
To a big old feather bed
Instead of cold hard ground

I still love the rodeo
But with you I can have it all
'Cause last night I found
A soft place to fall

I've run wilder than the horses
That I set out to ride
My freedom was the one thing
I fought for all my life

But something in your gentle touch
Took the flight right out of me
I thought love was meant, to be tied down
But, I've never, felt so free

CHORUS
",Soft Place to Fall
Chris LeDoux,"I never was the kind to wear my feelings on my sleeve 
But since I met you girl, there's been a world of change in me 
I've got to say I love you, hope you like the sound of that 
'Cause I can't keep it under this ol' hat 

[Chorus]
Under this ol' hat 
Is the head you turned around 
And the heart you stole away 
The day we met 
under this ol' hat's 
Two arms that long to hold you tight 
And boots I'd walk the soles off of 
To be here by your side 
And every night in my prayers there's just 
One thing I ask 
That the man you love will always be 
Under this ol' hat 

You've got me feeling things 
I've never felt before 
And it's so good to know when I come a knocking at your door 
That of all the men who'd love to waltz across your welcome mat 
The one you want is under this ol' hat

Chris LeDoux,"Well, I figure myself a mighty luck man with the simple few things I've got
There's money in the pockets of these old wore out jeans
I've got a trailer house and a lot
My wife's good lookin' and a heck of a cook and she does her best to satisfy
I've got a little bitty boy he's my pride and joy
And a happiness that money can't buy
Well I owe everything that I've got the the Lord he's delt me a mighty good hand
And I owe a lotta people in a lot of different ways for making me what I am
But the one thing that I'm most thankful for I guess it was a stroke of good luck
Is when the Lord looked down on this great big world and made those horses that buck

Well, I wonder what my life would be like today if not for them buckin' old broncs
I guess I'd be tied to desk and a phone or workin' at some old gas pumps
Well I know that I can't ride forever but I'll do it just as long as I can
Cause it's live for today forget about tomorrow life of a rodeo man
Well I owe everything...
When the Lord looked down on this great big world
And made those horses that buck




",Mighty Lucky Man
Chris LeDoux,"Well I spent half my life out on the highway
Chasin' rodeos through every little town
In an old pickup truck with a little cowboy luck
Well I never thought I'd ever settle down
Back then I didn't know what I was missin'
Just a runnin' wild and livin' fancy free
I had money in my jeans and my gold buckle dreams
And I swore no woman would ever capture me
But now things have changed and I'm happy
I got a women that I love and three boys that call me pappy
Got the good Lord up above I'm in a country that I love
Now what more could a cowboy ever need

Yea I had everything I ever wanted and a woman couldn't fit into my world
Cause I had broncs to ride and a million miles to drive
And a cowboy just can't have a steady girl
But now things have changed...
Got the good Lord up above I'm in a country that I love
Now what more could a cowboy ever need




",What More Could a Cowboy Need
Chris LeDoux,"Most of the time, things are pretty sublime in this little one horse town
Well they close all the stores and they roll up the steets
When the evenning sun goes down
But the fourth of July flags will be flying high
As folks come from miles around
They'll be roarin' all night till the dawns early light
When the big rodeo comes to town

Well there ain't no top names of rodeo fame no Tibbs nor Larry Mahans
Just some local cowboys out to make 'em some noise
But they know everyone in the stands
They're clean and they're wild with tobacco stained smiles
And they don't care if they make a dime
If they win or they lose well they don't give a hoot
They're out just to have a good time

There's cowboys and ladies and old folks and babies
And young girls with stars in their eyes
Flashy bronc riders and whisker'ed old timers tellin' their stores and lies
There's cold beer and Brandy and pink cotton candy
When it's all over they'll all head on down
To the rodeo dance some midnight romance
When the big rodeo comes to town

The bands playing loud to that dance hall crowd
As boots stir the dust on the floor
At the bar they're playin' old Willie and Whalen
As beers disappear by the score
But hangovers I'll bet they'll soon forget
When the next year comes rollin' around
They'll be at it again with all of their friends
When the big rodeo comes to town

With a heart big enough to roam
No more fences for you to look through

Room to grow as big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood

On the solid rock of trust

And still be side by side in love

Chris LeDoux,"In a lonely all night diner on a rainy city street
A girl eats at the counter with a suitcase at her feet
And the waitress looks her over and she knows that she can't pay
So when the girl slips out the door she looks the other way
There's a small light in the dark night human kindness deep inside us
If you see it in somebody's eyes there's no reason to be so surprised
Let it shine on it's only the light of the world

In an empty Greyhound station an old man stands alone
He counts out all his money to buy a ticket home
And the agent says he's got enough and puts the money in the drawer
Then he reaches in his pocket and puts in a dollar more
There's a small light

On a dark deserted highway a boy holds out his thumb
Two headlights they light up his face as he turns his collar up
And the trucker he goes right on by as the snow starts comin' down
But then five miles on down the road he stops and turns around
Let it shine on let it shine on let it shine on

Chris LeDoux,"She lives for the thunder, he lives for the rain
She was born in Manhattan, he grew up near Spokane
He found her sitting by the side of the road
Her long hair shining like that black Texas gold
They had nothing in common 'cept the need to move on
So they headed for somewhere further along

Dust devils were spinning out across the fields
That bridge was a burning underneath their wheels
That old muddy river was just running wild
For that western boy and a sweet Yankee child
She was more of a woman than any girl he ever knew
He had no idea what his world was coming to

Hanging on broken hinges, too weak to take the load
Just like that old farm boy when he wrapped her in his arms
He knew he'd never hold her long enough
To tame that young girl's heart
But he loved her with a fever that went way across the line
By the time the sun was high she was holding on
Through the tears she cried

Every now and then I see him again but he's not the same man I knew yesterday
His smile just grows smaller and smaller and the worry lines fill up his face
But lately I'm thinking the next time I see him just what I'm gonna say

Chris LeDoux,"The Calico Moon was rising that night
Shining like gold on the water
Me and my brother we hijacked a row boat
Set out like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer

Oars dippin' diamonds
As we rowed across the lake
An owl sang to who knows who
Lost in the wonder, under the Calico Moon

The calico moon lay soft on your skin
It was a night that I'll always remember
Our hearts filled with fire, holding each other

Love flowed as wild as the river
We talked of how we were meant to be
And how sometimes dreams do come true
We were young lovers, under the Calico Moon

Now that old moon has rolled around
So many times since then
And here we are still gazing at the night
We're captured in the magic of its spell again
You and I

The Calico Moon wakes in the East
And hangs on an amber horizon
When I see its light dance in your eyes
It reminds me of how lucky I am

Where would I be if I didn't have you?
Lord only knows what I'd do
Thank God in heaven for you
And the Calico Moon

There's only so much you can do

You're proud when they walk scared when they run

So you do all you can then you gotta let go

But the higher you climb the more you can see

Watch the cattle
As they bend down
Back at the wagons

Right after supper
Spread the bed rolls
On the ground
Me an willie

We took the night guard
And the sage
Never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon

Was blazin silver
No chance tonight
For stampede
We rode off yonder

In the distance
Towards the mountains
There in the west
Then I see lightening

And I hear thunder

Are gettin restless

And there's the campfire

Chris LeDoux,"Well my car broke down it's in the ditch wish I was the son of someone rich
I'd throw hundred dollar bills out on the road and I'd catch me a ride to the rodeo
There's a mule deer layin' by the road ahead he ain't sleepin' he's damn sure dead
Venison fryin' in the blazin' sun hey I need a ride come on someone
Yeah my car broke down I ain't got no money stuck out on the road
Hey I need a ride now won't somebody take me to the rodeo
[ guitar ]
There's a buzzard circlin' up in the sky he's lookin' at me with them beady eyes
Well I don't know but I've got a hunch he'd rather have me than that deer for lunch
Right now I wish I'd stayed in school but I had to be a rodeo cowboy fool
And I'll bet my daddy'd sure be proud if he could take a look at his son right now
Yeah my car broke down...

Here comes a blonde in a Cadillac she got the top rolled down and her hair tied back
But she don't look she don't even slow down she just keeps them wheels rollin' around
Yeah my car broke down...

Chris LeDoux,"I went to see the preacher, to teach me how to pray
He looked at me and smiled, then that preacher turned away
Said, ""If you want to tell him something, you ain't gotta fold your hands.
Say it with your heart, your soul, and believe it, and I'll say, Amen.""

Bang a drum for the sinners, bang a drum for your sins
Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for yourself son, and a drum for me

Well I called upon my brother, just the other day
He said, ""Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again.
I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet.
Well I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet.""

Bang a drum for the dying, bang a drum for the truth
Bang a drum for the innocence, lost in our youth
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for your brother, and a drum for me

I don't know where all the rivers run
I don't know how far, I don't know how come
But I'm gonna die believin, with each step that I take
Ain't worth the ground that I walk if we don't walk it our own way

I don't claim to be a wise man, a poet, or a Saint
Just another man who's searchin' for a better way
But my heart beats loud as thunder, for the things that I believe
Sometimes I want to run for cover, sometimes I want to scream

Bang a drum for the tomorrow, bang a drum for the past
Bang a drum for heroes, who won't come back
Bang a drum for the promise, bang a drum for the lies
Bang a drum for the lovers, and the tears they cry
Bang a drum bang it loudly, or as soft as you need

But as long as my heart keeps on banging, I've got a reason to believe",Bang a Drum
Chris LeDoux,"In a cloud of dust 'cross Texas, south of San Anton
A law-man and a cowboy push their horses on
Racing toward the Rio, running out of time
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline

Well the law-man wanted justice, the cowboy needs revenge
They tracked the outlaws' horses up to the water's edge
There across the Rio, a badge ain't worth a dime
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the border line

So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail
Destiny begins, heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time, on the borderline

In the safety of the Badlands, the outlaws stopped their run
The campfire rings (I think, maybe rages) 
With laughter of the evil things they've done
How they've taken all they wanted and they 
Killed the cowboy's wife, they knew no one would 
Follow them across the borderline

Now the lawman and the cowboy stepped out of the dark
Though it was two against the twenty, every bullet found its mark

And so goes the legend, that out there in the 
Night the two still ride together
Somewhere beyond the borderline",The Borderline
Chris LeDoux,"He's got a split finger wrap
And his rope's pulled way too tight
He's got a lunatic smile

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He takes one last breath
And time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open
To the world he dreams about

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He says it's really kind of simple
Keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'
Keep liftin' and reachin'
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns

Well what he loves might kill him
But he's got no choice
He's a different breed
With a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight

Chris LeDoux,"Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate

Bear tracks, bear tracks lookin' back at me

But he's holdin' on for one ride in Vegas, one ride in Vegas

That never will let him give up
And with fire in his eyes, he dances with thunder
Till one day his day finally comes

His heart beats fast with anticipation
Brighter lights than he's ever seen before
He's waited his whole life for the next eight seconds
And he'd do it all again for one ride in Vegas, one ride in Vegas

Chris LeDoux,"His name was Twister he lived in the pasture
Right down from my daddy's farm
They say there's a cowboy who once tried to ride him
Now he's mending fences with only one arm

On my way home from school somehow he always knew
Just when I'd come walking by
And he'd stand at the gate like the keeper of fate
And we both knew that one day I'd just have to ride

Now one crack of dawn well I slipped my boots on
And walked out towards that just rising sun
My heart skipped a beat when I heard his four feet
Pounding down on the red dirt like it was a drum

He walked up against me as if to convince me
His heart was easily tamed
Then I came to staring up at the blue and the black
With a handful of mane

Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky, I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride

Well, the years have gone by since that morning I climbed
On that shadow that cut through the fields
My shoulder still hurts when the weather turns worse
Sometimes you find the strength in the wounds that don't heal

Between horses and heartaches, women and mistakes
I've been through more than I should
But I strapped a saddle across every battle
And held on as long as I could

Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other

Chris LeDoux,"Well a few years back me and ol' John worked the Calgary rodeo. 
We were hangin' around town with nothing to do, nowhere else to go. 
Cowboys are known for their fun loving ways, pranks, and practical jokes. And I'll never forget the night we impressed a bunch of them Calgary folks. Well just down the hall in the ole hotel where me and old John stayed. 
Were some school marms, they'd come up from Dallas to party for a couple of days. 
Now these old gals was fancy dressers; they had wigs and beads and all. 
So we put on the hair, took off our boots, and boogied on down the hall. Well, you could never tell we were cowboys; we were real lookin' hippies by heck. With long hair, bare feet, old t-shirts, and beads around our necks. And shoot we just had to show someone so we boogied on down to the lounge. There was cowboys, and gents in nice old suits and ladies in long evening gowns. Well we found us a table, pulled out a chair and lit up some Bull Durham smokes. The smoke filled the air, everyone there thought these hippies were smokin' dope. Now Leonard and Cravy and old Ronnie 
Rosland were sitting two tables away. So we did what we thought hippies would do when we noticed them lookin' our way. Well we waved our long hair, rolled back our eyes, and sucked in them home made smokes. Sayin' stuff like cool and ya, man wow. We put on one heck of a show. Now Ronnie and Lenard, they'd been there a while and they wasn't feelin' much pain. I reckon they figured they'd have some fun with these two hippie freaks that walked in. Well the bar got deathly quiet, as those cowboys come our way. And the city folks knew it wouldn't be long till the battle got under way. Well Ronnie came right over to me and looked me right square in the eye and said, hey there boy, what's that stuff you're smokin' I Said, here man give it a try. Well that didn't make him too happy, and then when I told him to bug out he blinked and snorted like a mad brahamer bull, frolicked and foamed at the mouth. Well just about then, I looked at old John and his face had turned beat red, cause Leonard had grabbed him by the throat with plans to tear off his head! Ronnie reached out with a huge left hand and grabbed a hold of my hair. With a right fist cocked, he said now boy you better start sayin' your prayers!
Well he gave a yank and my wig come off and lay limp there across his hand. 
The most stupified look I've never seen on the face of any man. Well he 
Dropped the thing like a poisonous snake and stared at it there on the floor. 
The he looked up and saw who I was, he laughed, and gave out a roar!

Well this story doesn't have any moral; it was just one mighty good gag. But I sighed with relief Ronnie didn't swing first before he pulled off my wig.",Hippies in Calgary

They're parking cars in the old bean patch
There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
'Til the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch

Chris LeDoux,"I've been ramblin' out Montana way
Tryin' to live on a cow punchers pay
Been changin' them dams in the new summer hay
Irrigating alfalfa for six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story I'd be on my way
But the savings are slow to come on six bucks a day

Out here in the fields while the water runs down
With the sun high above me and the sky all around
I'm dreamin' my dreams of the Canada line
And the places I'd go if the money was mine
I'll tell you my story...

Come Saturday night well you draw out some pay
Then you go into town just to throw it away
And when the end of the month comes rolling your way
Well you ain't got much left on six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story...

Now if I drew out my time and I paid off my debts
I couldn't get to Great Falls on what I have left
But I've got me no choice when them diesel horns blow
Come a wind from the highway I got to pack up and go
Yeah money or none at all they can't hold me this way
For my blankets are rolled and tied and I'm leavin' today

I've been told I'm hard to find
It's raining here but I'm keeping dry
And for me that's doing good

To tell the truth there ain't much to know
I've dealt some cards and I've rodeo'd
But I haven't found that pot of gold
Like I said I would

Between the high lines and the fence posts

There's only one I'd like to change

I heard your daddy passed away
And I should've called your momma
To say how sorry that I am

Well, I don't think I'll be coming back
Spent too long, so I guess that's that

Chris LeDoux,"She was holding her breath and he attempted a prayer
And he was cussing the dust rising up in the air
'cause the old cattle trail, well, it weren't anywhere
For a baby to draw its first breath

And the unbroken West, well, it was no place to live
'cause it was hard to survive and it was Hell if you did
So he entered this world with a pair of clenched fists
And the first and last tears he'd shed

And the longhorns lowed him a welcome
As a new voice cried from the buckboard
And the Irish, they sang sad and lonely
'cause they knew a cowboy was born

Well, the Berry closed in and a century passed
The settlers plowed under the tall prairie grass
And the cow town's died off in a world changing fast
But the wind kept the spirit alive

'cause a young boy in Kansas, he caught a breeze one day
And in a five-second rush, he was fighting for eight
He saw it all so clear through the dirt on his face
He knew he was born to ride

And the long lost heir to the saddle finally found his way back home
As he picked up his hat, well, the crowd cheered
'cause they knew a cowboy was born
Yeah, that day a cowboy was born

From the heroes in the bright lights of Vegas
Through the poets of the sage and thorn
A proud legacy of a nation, thank God, the cowboy was born
Yeah, thank God, the cowboy was born",A Cowboy Was Born

Feel like I'm gettin' into something good
Don't want to stop so I'm knocking on wood
I think my streak of bad luck is over
I'm rolling in a field of five leaf clovers
Feel like I'm swingin' on a lucky star
A choir of angels singin' in my heart
I'm smiling like I never thought I could
Feel like I'm gettin' into some kinda something good

I've had some heartaches, I've had some trouble
I've packed my limit of them low down blues
I've had some bad breaks busted my bubble

Chris LeDoux,"Billy John grew up just west of Waco
He used to bare knuckle fight just for fun
He was as wild as a Texas tornado

He drew a bull they called Dust Devil Rage
And that twenty-two hundred pound hammer
Laid Billy John in his grave

Chris LeDoux,"I was six years old, my brother was ten
One July day came runnin' in
Seen a Ferris wheel at the edge of town
So, of course, we headed on down

Well, it took us an hour to walk that far
Carryin' our fortune in a Mason jar
It was all pretty sad, a cheap county fair
With a few old rides but there was ponies there

Well, the ponies stunk and the air was still
In that dusty circle behind the ferris wheel
This old guy smellin' of smoke and rum
Swung me up and sat me down on one

Well, I'd never rode a horse but I'd seen it done
Cowboy movies made it look like fun
This old man whispered a few soft words
It was the best advice I've ever heard

He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""

I went up a kid with shakin' hands
But I came down a full grown man
It was like he'd cast some voodoo spell
Things were different for me now, I could tell

'Cause whenever troubles come wanderin' in
His rhyme would pop in my head again
And somehow I rode through the needles and nails
Brambles and thorns that life entails

He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""

Well, I know some day, farther down the road
I'll come to the edge of the great unknown
There'll stand a black horse riderless
And I wonder if I'm ready for this

So I'll saddle him up and he'll switch his tail
And I'll tip my hat and bid farewell
And lift my song into the air
That I learned at that dusty fair

Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride
Now, don't be scared, just enjoy your ride",The Ride
Chris LeDoux,"I took her daddy's old two-horse trailer
I patched a place in the floor that was bare
And we loaded up her barrel pony
And a riggin' bag is all that I had
Left with our suitcases filled with desire
Four hundred dollars, two good spare tires

[Chorus]
Now our windshield's a painting that hangs in our room
Changes with each mile like a radio tune
We got up above, we'll make it on love
Under the rodeo moon

Sometimes we sleep in a hotel
When we're ridin' that hot hand of luck
Sometimes we crash at a friend's house
Sometimes we just sleep in the truck
At nighttime you'll find us out in the fast lane

Chris LeDoux,"She was painting a picture of slum life when the cowboy came limping by
Wearing tattered old boots with one sole gone and a far away look in his eye
Well he watched for a while as she painted and then he said mama you surely paint well
Yes you got all this on your canvas the dirt the squalor and the hell
Well she asked to paint him in the setting ah but he shook his head slowly and low
He said naw I won't fit your picture unless you can paint be back home
Can you paint me back home in Wyoming riding free neath the big sky above
Free as the wind on the prairie out in the hills that I love
I long to get back to Wyoming and I've hoped all these years that I can
Please paint me back home on your canvas paint me back in Wyoming again

Well I never claimed this festered city
You know I was raised on a ranch out in the west
I spent my young years bustin' horses and boy they said I could ride with the best
So I came here to Madison Square Garden to ride in the big rodeo
Ah but I got stepped on and all crippled up and chute bronc bustin' is all I know
Ah boy if I could just get back to Wyoming I wouldn't feel so alone
Ah but the pain is too much for the roamin' so please can you paint me back home

I want to hear the meadow lark singin' this cowboy's favorite song
I want to saddle up old paint and just ride him out across the hills
I belong in old Wyoming and I reckon that I always will

Everytime that I pack my suitcase it gets harder to drive away
The look that I see in my little girls eyes is beggin' me to stay

He's never been a hero and he probably never be one
But in his heart he knows he gave his all

If Lady Luck had smiled on you at all

He gives it all he's got but it's never quite enough
Oh the Lord and him alone know how he's tried
But he'll try and try again although he'll never win
And all that he's got goin' is his pride

The bones are just too tough and he doesn't have enough
Of what it takes to make it to the top
What makes him want to go well Lord I guess I know
He loves it too damn much to ever stop
He's never been a hero...

He bites the dust once more gets up to hear no score
Then he stumbles to the chutes to ease the pain
And underneath his breath he cusses to himself
I'll ride him if I get the chance again

Turkey feather duster.

Just give me a hamlee saddle and my little buckskin mare.


Well, I rode her up a mountain when we made that summer drive,
And I [g]took her to wyomin? for a rodeo or two,
At old cheyenne and saratoga, we roped them little dogies,
She the best ole gal this cowboy ever knew.


When she gets to old to rodeo too old to ride the range,
I'll take the buckskin lady out across the open plains.


Cause she's just an ole cow pony and I know she'd go plum crazy
If she had to stand unsaddled around the barn the whole day through
I'll just turn her loose to ramble underneath them rocky mountains
And tell 'em that her workin? days are through.

Chris LeDoux,"Now back in old Wyoming, many long years ago
When there was no law and order 'round to regulate the show
Those old Wyoming ranchers had a problem on their hands
Trying to keep the cow thieves and the rustlers off their land

Now old Tom Horn came a riding up one day
Gonna lend a hand to the cattlemen in his own peculiar way
Well, he took his 44-40 out and cleaned it up right well
Then he rode off down Dry Gulch with a sack of rifle shells

Old Tom Horn with a rifle by his side
Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

If you rode the Laramie Valley, by either day or night
You can be right sure he's watchin' you through his rifle sights
He laid out in the bushes and the rustler come around
Then he'll spill the boy with a single shot and chamber one more round

Now the rustlers tried to stop him but they found there was no way
He could pick them off from a mountain side a half mile away
Well, they ran him down the border but they never touched his hide
He just slipped across to his hide out on the Colorado side

Old Tom Horn with a rifle by his side
Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

Then one day young Willie Nickle was out a ridin' around
A 44-40 shot rang out and laid the poor boy down
Well, it was only fourteen years since that little kid was born
And they said it looked like the doing's of that lonesome Tom Horn

So the cattlemen went and strung him up
With a length of fresh snipped rope
But his ghost still hangs out in the hills and spooks the Antelope
Now all the rustlers hatred and all the cattlemen's fears
Have kept all Tom Horn alive through all the changing years

Old Tom Horn with a rifle by his side
Through the hills of Wyoming he would ride
There ain't no tellin' how many cattle thieves he killed
But it was God help the rustler when Tom Horn was in the hill

Chris LeDoux,"For your love
I'd rope the moon
And put it
In a blender
Mix up a concoction
That might 
Make you surrender
I'd bide the brand
Off a buckin' branded bull
Rob me a gin mill
I'd fill the ocean full
I'd take on the army
Her majesty's marine
Your love
Ain't just a cover
It's a whole magazine
For your love
I'd stop a freight train
Single handed
Spreadin' out the bins
In the Rio Grande
I'd climb the tower
At the TV station
Broadcast my affection
To the united nation
I'd take on the governor
In Washington DC
Your love
Ain't just an engine
It's a rockin' machine

[Chorus:]
For your love
I'd stop the hands of time
For your love
I'd dig a diamond mine
For your love
I'd do it all the time

Yes I would

For your love 
I'd walk a tight rope
And wrestle anacondas
Jump a motorcycle
Over half a dozen Hondas
Carve your initials
On a forest of bamboo
Paint the Brooklyn bridge
Baby paint with a broom
I'd take on the press
From Tokyo to Prada
Your love ain't just
A hot sauce
It's a whole enchilada

[Chorus:]

Yeah now",For Your Love [DVD]
Chris LeDoux,"There used to be a time candlelight and wine
Was all that a woman would need
Man you were a winner if you took her out to dinner
Or a movie she wanted to see

But the world has turned and it's time you learned
That the old ain't working no more
Yeah the rules have changed it's brand new game
And buddy if you want to score

You've got to get off the couch get out of the house
Long about Friday night
Shine up your boots polish up your moves
If you want to keep her satisfied

Oh a little bump and grind will do it every time
If you want to keep your little girl
But you don't stand a chance
'Less you take her out and dance
'Cause we're living in a honky tonk world

Well sooner or later all you couch potatoes
Where you're gonna be the lonely one
And if you want good lovin' then you gotta keep up
And you better know your Brook's from your Dunn's

Don't even think that your Engelbert Humperdinck
Record's gonna turn her on
'Cause Mister you can bet if you don't know the steps
Then you're gonna get left at home

You've got to get off the couch get out of the house

Now if you were cro-magnon you'd be draggin'
Them woman by the hair to your cave
You'd be down on your knees citing them soliloquies
Back in Romeo's day

Yeah you'd be kind of nifty if we were in the Fifties
And you had a cool car to drive
But we're living in the Nineties so you better shake your hiney
Or you're gonna get left behind

You've got to get off the couch get out of the house
Long about Friday night

Chris LeDoux,"I was born in a hurry but there wasn't any place to go
Nowhere fast seemed better than nowhere slow
I never really got the hang of hangin' around

When you get down to it
I guess, I always knew it
What it is that makes my world go 'round

It's a matter of horsepower
For eight seconds on miles an hour
That's the way I am and it's a fact I can't ignore

Yeah, big four legged, fuel injected
Runnin' wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower

Well, the view looks better from ahead than it looks behind
I've got a need for speed and I don't mean the drugs-store kind
Some people like a life that barely moves at all

I say more power to 'em
Then I fly right through 'em
'Til it slows down to a crawl

And then I think about horsepower

Chris LeDoux,"Life's like a road that you travel on
One day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and the lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
Break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands

Tennessee to the those L.A. nights
San Antonio to the Vegas lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the lights come in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Chris LeDoux,"Took my last fall in san diego
Bus headed north one headed south
I call a farm in colorado
And I lift a dusty pay phone to my mouth

She says hello I say itâ??s me hon
Sorry I stayed away so long
Tell the kids their old manâ??s through with playinâ?? rodeo
'Cause if itâ??s alright with you Iâ??m cominâ?? home

Well thereâ??s silence on the line
She says you sure did take your time
But I still need a man for the things a man is good for
You know how it is raisinâ?? crops and raisinâ?? kids

Demands a man at least as fit as you are
So come on git on home thereâ??s hay that needs a mowinâ??
A boy that needs a whippinâ?? and a hundred things to do
I hope youâ??ve finally found your mind

To leave that rodeo behind
Iâ??ve spent half my life just waitinâ?? here for you

I guess that nows the time Iâ??d better tell her
Hon Iâ??ve got this old friend thatâ??s here with me
He used to be a cowboy and a good one so they say
But now his legs are crippled he canâ??t walk you see

But hon you ought to hear him tell his stories
Sing the old songs play the guitar too
Iâ??d really like to show him colorado
But I thought Iâ??d better leave it up to you

Well thereâ??s silence on the line
And now I hear her sayinâ??
Babe I only need a man for the things a man is good for
And you know how it is a place just half this big

Demands a man at least as fit as you are
Put yourself in his place itâ??d awful hard to face
All the chores and work and nothing he could do
If you want to know my mind leave that rodeo bum behind
Donâ??t waste our time Iâ??m waitinâ?? here for you

Well cryinâ??s just for kids I put down the phone
Fumble with my crutches movinâ?? slow
I wish that I was on the bus thatâ??s colorado bound
And I hope the weatherâ??s nice in mexico",Silence on the Line [DVD]
Chris LeDoux,"Well there's always been groups of people that never could see eye to eye
And I always thougt if they ever had a chance to sit down and talk face to face
They might realize they got a lot in common

Well I was sittin' in a coffee shop
Just havin' a cup to pass the time
Swapin' rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine
When some motorcycle riders started snickerin' in the back

Started pokin' fun at my friend's hat
One ol' boy said ""Hey Tex where'd you park your horse?""
My friend just pulled his hat down low but they couldn't be ignored
One husky fella said ""I think I'll rip that hat right off your head.""
That's when my friend turned around and this is what he said

""You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat

""Now partner this old hat is better left alone
See it used to be my daddy's
But, last year he passed on
My nephew skined the rattler that makes up this ol' hatband

But, back in sixty nine he died in vietnam
Now the eagle feather was given to me by an indian friend of mine
But, someone ran he down somewhere around that Arizona line
And a real special lady gave me this hatpin
And I don't know if I'll ever see her again

""You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat

""now if your leather jaket means to you what this hat means to me
Then I guess we understand each other and we'll just let it be
But, if you still think it's funny, man you got my back up against the wall
And if you touch my hat you're gonna havta fight us all""

Well right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes
He turned back to the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside
But when my friend turned back towards me
I noticed he's ol' hatbrim
Well it was turned up in a big ol' Texas grin

Rope an ol blue nortern and milk it till it's dry

Chris LeDoux,"Well, I never was the kind to wear my feelings on my sleeve
But since I've met you, girl, there's been a world of change in me
Well, I've got to say I love you, hope you like the sound of that
'Cause I can't keep it under this old hat

Under this old hat is the head you turned around
And the heart you stole away, the day we met
Under this old hat's two arms that long to hold you tight
And the boots I'd walk the soles off of to be here by your side
And every night in my prayers, there's just one thing I ask
That the man you love will always be under this old hat

Well, you've got me feeling things that I've never felt before
And it's so good to know when I come a knocking at your door
That of all the men who'd love to waltz across your welcome mat
