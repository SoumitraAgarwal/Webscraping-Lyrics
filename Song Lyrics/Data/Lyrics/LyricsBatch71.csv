Donna Summer,"(I've) hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire

But I know since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's gettin' ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just want to let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Mama used to tell me
Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'
Hit it with your best shot every time
Well I, I didn't understand her
'Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
Or love will blow you right away

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Leave off that safety catch
There ain't no risk
We're gonna have some fun
I've got cha, love's begun
So stay with me
Until the mornin' sun

There's been a change inside
My life
And I just want to let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go",Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)
Donna Summer,"Deep in the night, when you're
Away from me
I'm reachin' out just to touch you
In my dreams
Countin' the hours 'till you'll be
Here again
So hard to wait, got to have you
Close to me
'cause baby

You, turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a 
Breath away

Somethin' inside has taken
Over me
So baby, can't you see you
Captured my heart
I can't disguise the things you
Make me feel
I should have known this was
Magic right from the start

'Cause baby, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away
We, we don't have a word to say
Our hearts can speak a thousand ways
When love is just a breath away

Take me, take me into paradise
Show me 
All the love that's in your eyes
Light up my life

You, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away
We, we don't have a word to say
Our heart can speak a thousand ways
When love is just a breath away
You, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away",Love Is Just a Breath Away
Donna Summer,"I used to visit the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis
Of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

All the men I knew had sad and
Sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your
Siren song
To tempt me to madness
I knew all the while
That your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a
Great love for me
Oh, yes I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Now life is lonely again
And only last year everything
Seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts would only
Be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite
Of it
But all I really care 
Is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you
I will and yet you are still 
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush, stifling those
Who strive
I'll live a lush life in some
Small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are
Lonely too",Lush Life
Donna Summer,"Seasons are changing
Children of love are alive
People reach out to survive
Together

Love is the message
We carry across the sky
Down through the passage of
Time forever

History unfolds
As this story's told

(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Coming to rescue
Rescue me

A man and a woman
Lost in each other's embrace
Star-crossed in time in a place
Far away
Innocent dreamers
Turning the wheels of chance
Searching to find romance
Forever

We will surely find
Love is for all time

(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key
Down through the history
Of love
Time is the one that holds
The answer
(and it's) the mystery of love
Oh, will it set me free

For all time
(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key
Down through the history
Of love
Time is the one that holds
The answer
(and it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key.",Mystery of Love
Donna Summer,"Night after night
I keep holding on
You say you love me
Then you leave me so lonely

Baby, I don't believe a word
You're sayin'
I think it's all some evil game
You're playin'

Still all day long all I do is think
About ya
You got me believin' that I can't
Live without ya
Well if ya want it, well here is
My confession
Baby, I can't help it, you're my obsession

Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love

I wait at home by my telephone
When I call your house, baby
You're not home
Knock on the door and rush
Down the stairs
When I open up, baby you're
Not there

When we're together and ya put
Your arms around me
Your love sweeps away all the
Confusion that surrounds me

You keep my mind
Forever, ever in doubt
You want me believin'
That baby, I can't live without

Protection that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love

We stand alone, at my window
And stare out, at the shadows
Down below
I feel your fingers on my face
I want to stay, I want to run away

Protection that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love

Donna Summer,"Dancin' close feelin' restless
It's a slow sultry night
It'll take a lifetime til sunrise
If you won't stay with me tonight
Feel your breath caress my shoulder
As your heart reads my mind
You don't have to tell me anything 
I can see everything in your eyes
It's so easy with you 
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me
I might be trembling,
But I'm not scared
Just my desire breaking free
I've never had a chance like this before 
To unlock all the doors to the woman in me
It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free 
To be the woman in me
Like the dark side of the full moon
I've never shown what I've showing to you 
It's so easy with you 
I don't need an excuse 
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me
It's so easy with you 
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in
Me",The Woman in Me
Donna Summer,"This won't be easy
You'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to nines 
For sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I choose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it too

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it appeared to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise, 
Don't keep your distance
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance",Don't Cry for Me Argentina
Donna Summer,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

(over, over)

Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had is

I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,

But he turned out to be like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

No more tears

But he's faster than light and he can walk a miracle mile
He'll point you out then he'll pull you in
I guarantee he'll be your best friend

He's a rebel and he's gonna be good anyhow
And the boys of the group oh they just wanna drag him way down
He's so straight ahead, he will blow your mind
He can be strong and yet so kind

What you see is what you get and what you get you won't regret
'Cause he's on the line
What you want is what he's got and what he's got, he's got a lot
'Cause it's alright, it's alright

Ooh he's a rebel, written up in the Lambs book of life
And there'll be no escape 'cause the stage has been set for a while
If he comes your way, he'll make you surrender
His story's clear and his voice so tender

What you see is what you get and what you get you won't regret
'Cause he's on the line
What you want is what he's got and what he's got, he's got a lot
'Cause it's alright, it's alright

If he comes your way, he'll make you surrender
His words are clear and his love's forever

He's a rebel 'cause he doesn't conform, that's for sure
But society rules and it's fallin' right down to the core
He'll love you like you've never been loved before
He always leaves you wanting him more

Think of all the changes we've been through
The laughter an' the tears
The years together
Little did we both know
When we fell we gave up all control
Though times get hard
We're strong enough to carry on

'Cause love has a mind of its own
It moves in it's own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of it's own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart and you're my home

Stayed awake last night
Told myself that this time we were through
That passion wasn't pain
My heart had changed
But then in the morning light
The feeling cut me like a knife
And then I knew
I couldn't walk away from you 'cause

Love has a mind of its own
It moves in it's own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of it's own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart and you're my home

Oh, we can drive ourselves so far apart
Till the world gets in between
Before you know, the distance grows
Till never we lose sight of the dream
But the wonder of it all
Is our love will survive
It never fails to keep us going
It never fails to keep us alive

Love has a mind of its own
It moves in it's own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of it's own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart and you're my home

Love has a mind of its own
It moves in it's own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of it's own

Feeling somewhat scared
When I vacationed in a land that I
Didn't know that well
But all the ladies there were nice
The gentlemen politely out of line
I kept on thinking how I'd like
To spend some time
I couldn't make up my mind, still
Waitin' for the right sign
I was down in Tokyo
Livin' in hotel Imperial

Met this man, he was something
Very strange
Said he was a spy from somewhere
Else way far away
He told me things about myself that
I could tell nobody else
Passed this message on to me, said
Spirits move in secrecy
I could almost read the man's mind
Waitin' for the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo

He passed this message on to me
Said spirits move in secrecy
A double agent amnesty
An Ian Fleming mystery

I, I know I read the man's mind
I know I got the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo
",Tokyo
Donna Summer,"It's a windy night
Of first and main
Of any city
Of a hundred names
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low

And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow
And the cats are out, gonna harmonize
They're headed for cool street on the main line
And here comes that joe serpentine
The life of a cat can leave you far behind

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

It's hard to be yourself
When everyone else is around
There's always someone out there
Trying to pull you down

You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon
You bet your life and you sell your soul
Give it all up for beggar's gold
And the hidden city has its own laws
Produces a species cats without claws

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

Oh, here they come again
Singing songs in a melody
Do, do, do, do, do

Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life
And the streets are full of pain
Specially when it's calling out your name
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice
The things the world has to offer nice
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind

Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, oh, oh, oh",Cats Without Claws
Donna Summer,"Right outside the window something's happening
A man he stares into a TV screen
From the next apartment we hear music
Bleeding through the scene

TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed
She must be pretty rich
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck

[Chorus]
And there's always someone watching
Eyes
TV's and someone's watching
Eyes
In the kitchen someone's watching
Eyes
And the maid and butler's watching
Eyes

Silent sunbeams falling across the window
Suddenly she awakens with surprise
Day and night they always go so quickly
In TV time...

Her husband rushes in and in the meantime
She just slightly smiles and turns her head
He just whispers something to her softly
God knows what he said...

You know it wasn't very long
Before the two of them were kissing
She was his wife, he was her man
But they knew what they were missing

[Chorus]

TV's on and someone's watching
Eyes
They're getting in through your eyes
Don't let them poison your mind...",Eyes
Donna Summer,"Every day I give you a reason to cry
I see the hurt in your eyes
But stronger yet
I see the love that shines

Help me learn to take on the nature of you
And love more than I accuse
And pardon others like you taught me to

'Cause something happens inside my heart
Lord, when I obey
Something happens inside my heart
Every time I pray

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
The ones who broke my heart
The way I've broken yours

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
And reach out through the pain
And touch with hands of grace

As you prayed for those who crucified you
""Forgive, they don't know what they do""
Compassion reched out to a world confused

Help me learn to bless those who persecute me
And pray for my enemies
And show them mercy like you've shown to me

'Cause something happens inside my heart
Lord, when I obey
Something happens inside my heart
Every time I pray

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
The ones who broke my heart
The way I've broken yours

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
And reach out through the pain
And touch with hands of grace

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
The ones who broke my heart
The way I've broken yours
Forgive me

As I learn how to forgive
And reach out through the pain
And touch with hands of grace
Forgive me",Forgive Me
Donna Summer,"I was stranded in the dark
Trying to find an open door, so alone
Chains were wrapped around my heart
Didn't know what love was for, no more
Heard these voices in my head
Telling me ""you'll never escape""
No you can't get away
When the spirit in me said
Your love could show me the way
My whole life changed on that day
Now I'm walking in the light all aglow
All I see is sunshine in my eyes
Skies of blue, it's true, I'm free

[Chorus]
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I was frightened in the cold
Desperate when you found me in time
You saved me from the world
Got my life back in control
Chased away the madness in my mind
You saved me right in time
Now the future's looking up
Skies are blue, all because of you
Got the sunshine in my life
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free

[Chorus]

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true, I' m free

Donna Summer,"We used to south of paradise
That was okay until you put your heart on ice
Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye

It's not the way that you care

I still hear her advice
She said don't ever bet against your feelings
Always think twice
Don't go and throw your love away
To some man just for the night
Promises, promises, don't waste your time
If his intentions don't feel right

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

I'm so thankful momma I am waiting
To find someone who
Was looking in the same direction
That you pointed to

I'll never turn and walk away
If my heart gives me the sign
When the one, comes along
He'll understand
That the wait was worth the while

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

No tomorrow
Could there be without you
And if you should say goodbye
I think that I would die

No stardust, no sign of romance

But he turned out to be like every other man

And we won't waist another tear

Don't put up with his stuff,
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill,
Get the check pay the bill,
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

I'm gonna be true
So true to you baby

And I've decided
To make a love stand
Next to you, right next to you baby
I fall in love with you (etc)

[Chorus]

When the night
Comes closing in
Be there for me, be there baby

We'll sail away
To a magic land
Stay forever...stay forever

Tenderly you call my name
Turned my heart into a burning flame

Without you
My heart is frantic
When we touch
It's so romantic
So romantic
See'mon now...work it
Work that magic [Repeat: x 4]",Work That Magic

Donna Summer,"And Gabriel appeared to Mary and said
""Do not be afraid Mary
You have found favor with god
You will be with child
And give birth to a son
And you are to give him the name Jesus
He will be great
And will be called the son of the most high
And the lord god will give him the throne of his father David
And he will reign over the house of David forever
His kingdom will never end""

I have traveled many moonless night
Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy father you have come
And chosen me now to carry your son

I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now

Hold me together
Be forever near me

Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For your are holy

If a wiser one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong
Help me be
Help me

Donna Summer,"[Spoken:]
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea
During the time of king Herod
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked
""where is the one who is born king of the Jews?
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him""

Lord we have traveled far
Torn and weary guided by your star
There before us the living king
Hallelujah his praises sing

Herod with a evil plan
Kill the babies
Came his bold command
He tried to alter god's holy plan
God has saved him
The son of man

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The chosen one of god
Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of love
The chosen one of god

Three kings from a distance come
Bearing gifts for the only one
Shout to heaven sound the drum
Tell the nations
The lord has come

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The chosen one of god
Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of love
The chosen one of god

He came to bring us his peace
He came to bring us his joy
To bring us love

Behold the lamb of god

But he turned out to be like every other man

Don't put up with his stuff,
Don't you do it

Get the check, pay the bill,
You can do it

Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eye and simple shout

As we followed in the dance

All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

I'd make you feel better when you're feeling blue
I'd say something nice

Say something nice, only once or twice
Say something nice
I wanna hear that I'm beautiful
But you wouldn't say it even if I were
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur
You wouldn't say nothin' nice
Tell me you think that my hair's real nice
Don't stand around and just criticize
Can't you understand that when a person tries
You say something nice
And it's oh so hard, oh so hard

Oh, say something nice, just once or twice

Back where you belong

Standing in the shadows
Watch your never-ending flight
Just how high as high to be before you see the light
Will this be the change you need to show you who you are
I love you but I'll leave you just to prove you've gone too far

Soon I'm gonna leave you just because I want you

A handshake seems more fitting than a kiss

Surely you can ask the better way
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late

Can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Who knows maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride and the things we said last night
And maybe you and I can talk it out

Tonight stay somewhere warm, they say it's gonna freeze
You may not find a place at all, so be sure and take your keys
I can almost taste the silence now
Does it really matter still who was wrong, who let who down?

Oh can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Who knows maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night

But he turned out to be
Like every other man

And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill
Get the check pay the bill
You can do it

Tell him to just get out get out get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

And the death was slow 'cause she won't let go

She was all over him 'cause he played all the cards just right

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed,
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky.
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why.

All the sweet, green icing flowing down

I'm a woman that you've never seen
You might know me from somewhere else
As someone that I've never been.

I gave everything to play the game
My soul fell apart at the seams
I fell down like a house of cards
When somebody pulled the queen.

[Chorus]
'Cause you could spend your life
Lookin' for your own reflection
Time could blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected
Had I known what I lost?
What I gained, what it'd cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again.

You must believe me when I say
Don't live someone else's design
Turn it around like a photograph
The writings been there all the time.

Now you can have all these hopes and dreams
The ones I can't use anymore
I don't know what it is you lost
But I hope you got what you came for.

[Chorus]

Sometimes I want to leave right now
Sometimes I want to cry out loud
I want to let it all hang out
But I don't want to let you down.

Sometimes I want to just lay here
Sometimes I want to disappear
I want to show you all my fear
But I don't want to let you down.

Everyday routine
Make up fake up get a manicure

Create a scandal with your reaction
What's that you say

I'd watch old movies on the silver screen
Kate Bette and Marilyn were the reigning queens

Out of this sleepy town then I could go real far
I could I'd really work so hard
And I could do it and do it and do it 'til I become a star

Little black book pools with the CEO
Smile and tell'em what they wanna know
And tell'em what they wanna know

I'm feeling my love is out of control
I wanna give up but I can?t let go

You're always on my mind
Always have been, always will be
I think about you all the time
I don't want to, you're a habit

And I'm running and running and
Running and running away from you
Every time when you call, I come undone can't escape from you

Is it the science of Love?
It's the science of Love
It's the science of Love

I was just a little girl
A-making my own way
16 years or more I had
Nothing left to say

I raised myself up almost
Lived on po'boys too
New Orleans ain't a place to live
If you never been to school

And I said
Ride over backwards
Slide over backwards
Ride over backwards
Let me ride

People gotta tell you
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
Ride over backwards
Let me ride

Daddy was a working man
He worked since he was 5
He dropped his wings on my train one day
And never learned to fly

I wonder what it takes to be
Someone who knows why
The earth ain't round
Unless you can
Teach yourself to fly

And I said
Ride over backwards
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
Let me ride

People gotta tell you
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
(Sometimes you gotta be free)
Slide over backwards
Let me ride

Some days in a lifetime you gotta be strong
Some days in lifetime you gotta be brave
Dig on your knees sometimes
Sometimes you even gotta pray

Lord what it is what it is

Sometimes I feel like I'm going down, going down
Going down for the very last time
Oh don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Sometimes I feel like going down

Deep in my heart I pray

It is now thought that the world is round
Everyone sees that sprinkling poison kills this flower
But what of the magic that causes this flower to be
Blues, greens, shades of demise, circle of surprise
We are born, then die
Thinking, thinking, feeling, smelling
Forever swimming in the middle, it's a question then a riddle
So as I lay down, totally immersed in the riddle of the universe
The unknown still far outweighs what we can be sure about these days

So we will amass all of these unknowns and label them spirit
We will take all the essence and the magic connection and call them love
And we will mix them in a pot with experience
And put them in my heart to bake at 98.6 degrees
And so I go walking, deciding, colliding
Searching from moment to moment 
Urging this bell to ring
For it makes me happy when causes are to sing

In the riddle of the universe

As I raise my hand in destruction
As I raise my hand in tender caress
As I raise my hands to sounds in the darkness
It's with an understanding that I do not fully possess
So let's start this religion with a question
Let's start with the dreams we may have left behind
Let's build a fortress of love by the river
With all of the happiness that we can find",Riddle of the Universe
Donna the Buffalo,"Lookin' out over yonder mountain
Lookin' out over waves of grain
Lookin' out across the prairie
Lookin' out at an endless chain
Lookin' out at the wide open spaces
Lookin' out at the valleys below
Lookin' out with a hungry perspective
Lookin' out with the will to know

Chorus:
The waters led to the promised land
Seeds of greed washed upon it's shore
White footprints in the settling sand
Brought the ways of the ignorant man

See a train trace the horizon
See this ridge trace these lanes
See this wheel turn in direction
See the wind in the rattlin' cane
See a face in the spirit of old
See the longhorn at home on the range
See the emptiness in searching for gold
See the beauty in the treasures we hold

Donna the Buffalo,"They say change comes and change is good
And that friends like us will endure all time
Then for the years we'll laugh until we cry
This with love is our goodbye

Chorus:
On your way home
Let our love be your guide
On your way home
Take the love we share

Silent times have switched and shifted
Heavy hearts wishing you could stay
The counter balance has been lifted
As we watch your tail lights fade away",Your Way Home
Donna Tucker,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights

So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of

From their vast mysterious sky

Guaranteed to spend it all in just one place

Taking fish, never learning, that they're keeping this whole thing turning

Donnie Elbert,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow [1997 Remix]
Donnie Iris,"We were standing on the corner one night
Me and Agnes
She had these tight jeans on
And these high shoes
Bad

It was a warm September night
Wind was blowin' through the trees
This dude Louie was looking for a fight

He knocked me down with all his might

He put a gun up to my head
Stay away from her or you'll be dead
Don't you ever see that girl he said

Agnes was a waitress at our bar
Louie said she'd never go too far
Louie didn't see her in my car
Louie didn't see her in my car
After that fight at Louie's bar

Yeah Agnes 
Caused you all this sadness
(He didn't know that you were out of your mind)
What you did was madness
(He didn't know it was the end of the line)
Someday we're gonna pay
(He had it coming to him)
We gotta watch out
(Watch out)
There's been talk about
(I didn't know that you were out of your mind)
Soon they're gonna find out
(I didn't know it was the end of the line)
What we did that day
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

She got off work at 2 o'clock
We drove away so we could talk
We didn't see Louie in the dark

Louie pulled me out onto the ground
Then I saw Louie start to run
He didn't know she had his gun
(He didn't know she had his gun)
I didn't know she had his gun

Oh-oh Agnes
He caused you all this sadness
(He didn't know that you were out of your mind)
It was madness
(He didn't know it was the end of the line)
We're gonna pay

Donnie Iris,"I dig the sound of the old street cars
Hooker's perfume and the shabby bars
That old cop who busted me
Never forgot my name

I dig the summer and the sticky sheets
The traffic and the litter and the jukebox beats
The night winds stir the old ghosts
And they haunt those less likely 
They cry out loud and sound their warning
Your legends won't survive the morning light

They try
Back on the streets
Back on the streets

Now over in the corner stands Louie's Bar
The names have all been changed
And Louie's pictures in the frame
Back on the streets
He's in the hall of fame
So there you have your legends boy

Agnes lives alone on 42nd street
Badgered by a fat man's memory
Back on the streets
She won't get too far
Gettin' riddled in the dark

She cry's out loud and sounds a warning
Her memory won't survive the morning light

Oh but she tries
Back on the streets
Back on the streets

In a world that's sometimes cold
Where all is bought and sold
Like clothes we outgrow

Oh love is patient and it's kind
It never looks behind
Or changes its mind

Oh but they try
Back on the streets
Back on the streets
They die

Oh how they lie

Back on the streets
Back on the streets they die
Oh how they try

That we were meant to see
The way love ought to be

Sat up on my Daddy's knee
Said Dad there's something buggin' me
There's a word I looked it up
The definition ain't enough
What is the meaning of love?

He said when you don't know what's up or down
Your head is spinning all around
Your feet don't seem to touch the ground

Yeah you won't know from push or shove
Boy you feel the pounding of your heart
You know that you're in love

I am torn apart
What's this pounding in my heart
I can't walk away
Feeling stronger everyday
I can't sleep at night
I fear it might be tragic
I ain't eating right
This time it might be magic
What's come over me
Don't think that I can stand it
It's really got a hold on me
This time it must be love

Daddy told me about the bees
About the birdies in the trees
Love was still a mystery to me
Stand out in the pouring rain
Jump into a roaring flame
When you're in love boy you don't feel no pain

I am torn apart
Lord it's tearing me apart
I can't walk away
Gotta be a better way
I can't sleep at night

Donnie Klang,"Let me start by sayin',
I still love you, but when you were gone, I met somebody. 
I don't know,
I don't know what to do. 
Which one?

[Verse 1]
I never meant to be in the wrong, though I must admit that she had me gone. 
Caught up in believing that she was the one, I created a storm. 
Let me explain what's goin' on. 
She kept me sane when you were gone. 
I never knew all the things she would do, they remind me of you.

[Chorus]
I know I love her, but I gotta be sure. (gotta be sure)
She reminds me of the one I adore (one I adore)
I don't wanna be confused anymore
I gotta pick one (one, one, one, one)
Which one (one, one, one)
Which one?

[Verse 2]
I know this is strange, but let me go on. 
It's like the more that she stayed, the more she belonged. 
I wanted to escape, but it kept getting stronger and stronger. (I couldn't leave her alone) 
When I met her things suddenly changed. 
Now I'm stuck in the middle tryin to find find my way. 
I'm wonderin' if this is all a mistake. 
Nothin' will ever be the same.

[Chorus]

Baby I'm in love (baby I'm in love)
I'm in love with her too (I'm in love with her too)
I know that is seems unfair (so unfair)
But what can I do (what can I do)

Help me say, help me say

One thing that I desire from the Lord
That one thing will I seek for
That I may dwell within His house
And inquire in His temple
And behold the beauty of the Lord

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me 
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Don't ever let me go

Say you love me

Donnie McClurkin,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Blood Medley: At the Cross/Down at the Cross (Glory to His ...)
Donnie McClurkin,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close

Donnie Munro,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Now all around the world, in every iittle town
Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed",Nothing But a Child

But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Donny Hathaway,"I was dreaming of the past,
And my heart was beating fast.
I began to lose control, 
I began to lose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside,

I was swallowing my pain,

Donny Hathaway,"We're flying high on a velvet sky,
With the wind on our wings
Climbing easily on the breeze

We're flying easy and we do just what we please
We drink the breezes as we drink wine,and the nectar is sweet
Now the feeling we have is fun

We're flying easy drifting on a summer breeze
The trip is smooth and we gently glide
We ride the rainbow and we see to a tee
How happy we can be

We gather gold from the evening sun
And it's heavenly hues
And we don't have a thing to lose
We're flying easy and we do just what we choose

The trip is smooth and we gently glide
We ride the rainbow and we see to a tee
How happy it can be to be free

We float and there is no thought of time
Cause were singing of love
And the pleasure is so divine

We're flying easy not a worry on our mind
We're flying easy not a worry on our mind
We're flying easy on a breeze
Flying, flying flying",Flying Easy

Is hard to do
When you really
Love someone

Her kiss and her caress

Mean so much
And bring you happiness

So hard to do
I've tried
But it just ain't no use
Giving up
So hard to do
I said I've tried
But it just ain't no use

But my light of hope
Is burning dim
But in my heart I pray
That my love and faith
In the girl
Will bring her back to me

Ooh, whether
Whether she knows or not
She really needs me too

Is all I got
Yes she is

When she turned and smile at me 
I knew I had to stay

It was hard to leave her there

Time will not change me 
Winter ain't no snow
Look at me, oh look at me
I'll be here so come on and love me
 
Anytime sunshine
I'll be here anytime that you want me

Anytime you're near
You bring me sunshine 
Every time you call
Anytime sunshine
Anytime at all

Now ever since that day to the small cafe I wonder
Knowing she'll be waiting there
And begging me to stay

Now let the years go pass
In my mind should last forever
Still I feel her close to me
And I'll hear her say

Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms

No, your eyes don't lie,

Outside my doorway. 
Could it be you, there in the dark? 
Even now, I know that you can feel the spark. 
So step inside (into my life) 
Into a new world, 
And take a tour of all my thoughts. 
Why resist, you know this feeling can't be fought. 
I'd never lie to you or lead you astray. 
You'd better listen to the words they say

And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

I sat upon your knee. 
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies. 
Well, I'm all grown up now, 
But still need help somehow. 
I'm not a Chile but my heart still can dream. 

So here's my lifelong wish, 
My grown-up Christmas list, 
Not for myself, but for a world in need: 

No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
Ev'ry one would have a friend, 
That right would always win, 
And love would never end: 
This is my grown-up Christmas list

As children we believed 
The grandest sight to see 
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree. 
Well, heaven surely knows 
That packages and bows 
Can never heal a hurting human soul. 

No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
Ev'ry one would have a friend, 
That right would always win, 
And love would never end: 
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of youth? 
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth! 

There'd be,
No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
Ev'ry one would have a friend, 
That right would always win, 
And love would never end:

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Donny Osmond,"No one seemed to notice
The man beside the road
He was just a ragged soldier
Out there in the cold
But he seemed to have a purpose
Only known to him
As he walked along the streets that night
Through the town of Bethlehem

In his head he held a memory
Of all the wars he'd known
In his hand he clutched a medal
For the bravery he'd shown
And the weight of every battle
He carried in his heart
But his eyes were clear and searching
For a manger in the dark

[Chorus]
Some are born to greatness
Some are born to fall
Some are bound to be forgotten
Like they never lived at all
But we're all born to know Him
And stand before His light
Like the soldier who found his king tonight

He had marched for politicians
Served under their command
And he fought for all the causes
That he did not understand
But it was something deep inside him now
That led him on his way
With a single star to guide him
To were the baby lay

[Chorus]

He stood before the Son of God
Come to pay our debt
He smiled up at the soldier
That the world would soon forget
So he held out his medal
And said this for you I bring
There he swore allegiance 
To the newborn baby king

Donny Osmond,"There was an old man
Who was robbing himself blind
For too many years
The only thing he stole was time
He gambled with only a moment to spare
His destiny close - he could taste it in the air
Seized him without warning
Disarmed him of his plans
But the odds were even
He'd won a second chance
He laughed and said
It's all in the game
Remember that
Winning isn't everything

Live to the limit
And listen to your heart
Don't let life leave you
Standing in the dark
Luck fades away
But the spirit never dies
It's all in the game
Keep the fire in your eyes

Break in a sweat
Pull up your collar and cuff
Tryin' your best
Sometimes your best ain't good enough
Some people spend years at a time
Other people spend every nickel and dime
You're gonna have to play
Or pay the consequence
Lay your money down
Or put in down to experience
Remember that
It's all in the game
Don't forget
Winning isn't everything

Live to the limit
And listen to your heart
Don't let life leave you
Standing in the dark
Luck fades away
But the spirit never dies
It's all in the game
Keep the fire in your eyes

Break in a sweat
Pull up your collar and cuff

I know I should have told you
All that you mean to me
If you leave me
I won't survive

Whispers my name and I'm rendered helpless

Just to keep her out of my heart

Before we even start

I know inside that she's the angel of my soul
She's the answer to my prayer
I know I'd better keep her out of sight because
They say that love is blind
So I'll just keep her in mind

She is so intoxicating, amazing
Her eyes burn like fire and I'm frozen, broken

All my defenses desert me now
I'm trying to speak but my words don't make a sound

Always keep her where I can't lose control
Oh no, I'm falling, I feel it
I just can't believe it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna fall

Donny Osmond,"There will always be a dream
In the heart of each beginner
Like the promise of a thousand springs
Hidden deep inside each seed

And in spite of what is lost
You are born to be a winner
From the moment you surrender
Believing forever

One dream, one hope
Once chance to see
The miracle of grace unfold
Like wings we hold
Reaching from the heart
Waiting for the spark of one dream

There will always be a place
For the love we have between us
Many languages but just one voice
And the wish for peace, the only choice

May the boundaries melt away
And the light of faith redeem us
For it's only when we learn to trust
We follow together

One dream, one hope
One chance to see
The miracle of grace unfold
Like wings, we hold

One dream, one hope
One chance to see
The miracle of grace unfold
Like wings, we hold

Feel it in the air
All this world has seen
Each of us will always share
One dream

Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

Right on time you would always be there

They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd

I had a dream as daylight touched the sky
As breezes chased along the winter lane.
I had a dream as dreams alone I dreamt
Has every man his chain,
Has every man his chain ?
A negro hid beneath a face of blood
And is there really anyone to blame ?
I marveled at the beauty of children's minds.
Has every man his chain,
Has every man his chain ?
I saw a beach of sand beside the sea
And there before me I saw every grain
And I wondered, well, it was best this way
Every man has his chain,
Every man has his chain.

But it's taking time.

A-one to please my mind as well as my time.

Flying through the night.
But I hurt my good gal,
I hope she makes out right,
Flying through the night.

I've been picking up the sunshine,
I've been drinking down the rain, girl,
I've been picking up the sunshine,
It makes me think on when I'll see you again.

You know time could bring a change, girl,
It ain't for me to say.
You'll soon be out of range, girl,
A-this could only be the way it's meant to be.

The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion
Seagull flies across my eyes forever.

Would I, should I, could I be a stranger,
I shall walk right by and sigh goodbye.

Donovan,"I will bring you gold apples and grapes made of rubies
That have shone in the eyes of a prince of the breeze.
Bright cascading crystals, they danced in the sand dunes
On the beach of no footprints to harpsichord tunes.

A throne of white ivory, a gown of white lace
Lies still in the magic of a timeless place.
One hundred small children, they laugh at the white doves
That rest on their hands with the touch of love.

On a hillside of velvet the children they lay down
And make fun of the grown-ups with their silly frown.
And the sound of their laughter is the sound of the green sea
As it washed around the foot of the seashell tree.

The doves circle over and land in the trees
Where parrots are talking their words with such ease.
Thus spoke three wizards to the young ones that day:
""There's sadness in the kingdom, make it go far away.""

If you follow the sunbeams through the valley of flowers
To the palace of the White Queen with its white jade towers.
The youngest, she sighed then the clouds drew away
And a hundred small fingers scratched their heads in dismay.

>From out of the sun a giant gull came flying
And the children got ready to sit on its wings.
They waved to the raindrops as they soared over the trees
The wind tossed their hair high, flashing gold on the sea.

They came to the castle and there they did fall,
And they saw all the sadness, through the crystal wall.
A princess lay a-sleeping so gentle and kind
Whilst her prince took to battle with his confused mind.

The clash of bright metal brought the children fear,
But their cloaks of blue satin dried up all of these tears.
Thus children held hands and they spelled out their name
All the golden children became a golden chain.

With a tunic of velvet and a gown of white lace.

Living in the deep blue sea
Crawl to me I have proposition to make thee
Would you walk the north sea floor
To Belgium from England
Bring me word of a banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.

Spoke as spokesman should
""If'n you met our fee then
Certainly we would,
If you cast a looking-glass
Upon the scallopped sand
You'll have word o' this banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.""

""Come ye starry starfish
I know your ways are caped
Maybe its because your astrologically shaped,
Converse with the herring shoals
As I know you can
Bring me word o' the banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.""

The eldest of the starfish
Spoke, after a sigh,
""Youthfull as you are young man
You have a 'Wisdom Eye';
Surely you must know a looking-glass
Is made from sand?
These youngfish are fooling you
About this banjo man.""



""Come then aged starfish
Riddle me no more,
For news I am weary
And my heart is sore;
All on the silent seashore,
Help me if you can,
Tell to me if you know
Of this banjo man.""

""All through the seven oceans
I am a star, most famed,
Many 'leggys' have I lost
And many have I gained,
Strange to say quite recently
I've been to FlemiSH Land
And if you are courteous
I'll tell you all I can.""

""You have my full attention""
I answered him with glee,
His brother stars were twinkling
In the sky above the sea
So I sat there with rapt
Attention, on the sand,
Very anxious for to hear
Of the banjo man.

""I have seen this tattooed hand
Through a ship port-hole,
Steaming on the watery main
Through the waves so cold,
Heard his tinkling banjo and
His voice so grand
But you must come to Belgium
To shake his tattooed hand.""

""Gladly would I come oh
Gladly would I go,
Had I not my work to do
And my face to show,
I rejoice to know he's well
But I must go inland,
Thank you for the words you brought
Of the banjo man.""

I walked along the evening sand
As charcoal clouds did shift
Revealing the moon shining
On the pebble drift
Contemplating every other word
The starfish said
Whistly winds they filled my dreams
In my dreaming bed.

How blessed the forest
With birdsong
How neat the cut peat
Laid so long
Felt like a seed on your land

fan faring daffodilly
Trumpetingly small
All along the bathing hut wall

far across the empty beach

Makes an image magnet to my sight
Gown of purple velvet enchanted glazed eye
The sound of wings and sparkling rings behold a crimson sky

Tread so light so not to touch the grass
Breathe the air so slowly as you pass
Silent sudden dewdrop lies unseen until
Eyes to fall to hidden call the power of Love and Will

Symphonies of Seaweed dance and swoon

Or deep asleep in India, fill his dreams

Dear snow white gulls upon the wave
I, like you, am lamenting, for my love.
I a-weary cry upon the shore.

And in my chariot of sleep,

I was me and you were you,
How do you do ?

He looked as though he never cared
To run a comb where a comb should run,
Freckles from the sun.
Many good times we have had,
We been happy, we been sad,
But I think we both feel glad
That this life is so mad, mad, mad.

Whither you go blindly over the mountain.
Oh your boats upon the sea are very beautiful to view
By me, by me, by me, by me, I hope by you.
Oh your boats upon the sea are very beautiful to view
By me, by me, by me, by me, I hope by you.
Once I tried to be your friend, but I was undergoing change
The same as you, the same as me, the same as you,
The same as me, the same as you.
And from what I've read you say
You feel quite certain of the way
The world will go, the world will go,
The world will go, the world will go, and so am I.
Oh, oh and there will come a time
When to each other we'll be kinder
Than we were, than we were
And there will come, and there will come
A peace of mind, a peace of mind, a peace of mind.

In Tangier down a windy street
Where beggars meet and on old rags do sleep
The women dressed in soiled white sheet
With starving kids by their side.
With staring eyes that never weep
Old Moroccans with their elephantiasis feet
Who life and death treat so cheap
Happy in their hunger
For they live longer than their fathers.

I'm not proud to say I am merry here.
I've found a girl and I love her so,
Groovy, groovy woman and she set me free.
Hark awhile and listen to this love song.
Give me for sometimes I wanted to
Take her to the woods and show her what to do.
She could see the stars if she's looking up,
Drink the sweet juice from a loving cup,
Show her what it is to make a love song.
Hey, have you ever seen the lonely ones
Putting down the lovers for having fun ?
The very same thing that would set them free,
They should catch an evening with my lover and me,

Anchored in the bay of innocence
Is left a lonely man

I dropped a berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire aflame
But something rustled on the door
And someone called me by by name.

It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossoms in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Through hollow lands and hilly lands
I will find out where she has goner

Movin' her body before she can walk

But you feel and you hurt and you love

Parade your pretty self into town
Won't be too long now and you'll get around.
For to feel and to hurt and to love

Donovan,"God is playing marbles
With his planets and his stars
Creating havoc through my life
Through his influence on Mars
That's why I'm stumbling down the highway
On my boots of steel
I should be rolling down the skyway
On my cosmic wheels

In the present position of the planets
It's impossible for me to say
Just when I'll find my course again
With these boulders in my way
I should be rolling down the skyway
On my cosmic wheels
Instead of stumbling down this highway
On my boots of steel

I knew naively that I was your man
I followed after with heavy heart of lead
Just like a man who walks, yet is dead
I asked you to dance
And you wondered and you thought you might
So we went and took a chance
On the cat walk in the cold star light

I held you

Album: Cosmic Wheels - 1973


I was impressed like everyone,
When man began to fly,
Out of earthly regions,
To planets in the sky.
With total media coverage,
We watched the heros land,
As ceremoniously
They disturbed the cosmic sand.

In awe with admiration,
We listened to the talk.
Such pride felt they,
Such joy to be
Upon the moon to walk.
My romantic vision shattered,
When it was explained to me,
Spacemen wear old diapers
In which they shit and pee.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem,
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

They don't partake like you and I,
Of beefy burger mush.
Their food is specially prepared
To dissolve into slush.
Absorbed by multi-fibers
In the super diaper suit,
Otherwise the slush would trickle
Down inside the boot.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

You may well ask now what becomes
Of liquid they consume.
A pipe is led from penis head
To a unit in the room.
The water is recirculated,
Filtered for re-use.
In case of anti-gravity -
Pee gets on the loose.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

Wherever man has conquered,
On the quest for frontiers new,
(Da da da da)
I'm glad that he's always had to do
The number one and two.
It makes it all so ordinary,
Just like you and me,
To know the greatest heroes,
They had to shit and pee.

The intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to there,
For cosmic constipation
There's none that can compare.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
The intergalactic laxative,
The intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to Mars.

And can't seem to raise your head
You sit staring in the teacup
At the egg upon your bread
And the life that you are living
Doesn't seem to be quite real
You have only what the lonely call the blues

When you're feeling tired and weary
With your eyes cast to the floor
For a loved one who has left you
On a bleak and distant shore
You may think you're being picked on
But you are not the first
To have only what the lonely call the blues

- There are no rules to follow
No advice to take
You're the only one
Who can give yourself a shake
Someone will appear
To dispel all your fear
In a funny unexpected way -

Then you'll wake up in the morning
With a smile upon your face
And you'll look out on the world
And see it is a happy place
With no memory of misery
You will soon forget
You had only what the lonely call the blues

We stood in the windy city,
The gypsy boy and I.
We slept on the breeze in the midnight
With the raindrop and tears in our eyes.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We huddled in a derelict building
And when he thought I was asleep
He laid his poor coat round my shoulder,
And shivered there beside me in a heap.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We sang and cracked the sky with laughter,
Our breath turned to mist in the cold.
Our years put together count to thirty,
But our eyes told the dawn we were old.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done ?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
Mirror, mirror, hanging in the sky,
Won't you look down what's happening here below?
I stand here singing to the flowers,
So very few people really know.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,

There is an ocean of vast proportion
And she flows within ourselves.
To take dips daily we dive in gaily,
He knows who goes within himself.

The abode of Angels, the mystical Promised Land,
The one and only Heaven, the God of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

There is a silence of pure excellence
And she flows within ourselves.
To appreciate, we deactivate,
He knows who goes within himself.

The domain of Devils, the Fearful Land,
The only and only Hades, the Satan of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

All is as it was and ever more shall be,
Though they try to tell us it's not so.
Over all the earth there's nothing new to see,
Excepting every seed will newly grow.
Innocence of childhood false men misconstrue
To be years of darkness spent in shade,
Denying childhood's vision of the God of Love,
So that Truth be turned about and untruth made,
And untruth made.

There is a reason for every season
Of change within ourselves.
To navigate, re-appreciate
And know the flow within ourselves.

The deliverance from Deluge, the good dry land,
The one and only Haven, the rock of Man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.
There is an ocean, ooh,
There is a silence, ooh,
There is a reason, ooh.

With her silk and her incense
Harmonising hotel rooms.

Dressed you up in Art Nouveau

Donovan,"From the album slow down world

It was up some laughing river where I'd gone to spend the day.
I had such fantastic visions I could hardly stand to stay.
And I stood within myself and suddenly felt free,
And I stood above the burdens that puzzle you and me.
I became awareness that was shared with all around,
With the trees, the sky, the flowers, and the wind, the sun, the ground.
I heard the birds were singing and I found them same as me,
And I understood our sorrows and why they should not be.
I saw this plane of living, it was nothing more than faith,
A skin that covered glory, far beyond our love or hate,
A living crystal fairyland where loving is our grace,
A pyromanic garden that knows no time nor space.
I saw what we've been doing to it, saw it as insane,
Still a marching like good Christians with our wars, the sword, the flame,
To crush all those damned infidels, defend what should be shame.
And again I shared our sorrows and knew we all must bear the blame.
I see it all as part of us to know and share alike
With a universal willingness to know and do what's right,
To understand our brotherness and stop this awful race,
Let our children grow in peace, know their life shall not be waste.
First there is a mountain, then it seems the mountain's gone,
But then, if you take another look, why, it's been there all along.
We can be just like that river as it laughs along its way,
Or stand beneath the shadows that take the sun away.

Donovan,"From the album slow down world

Major problem ahead,
You have been on the go
For a long, long time I know.
Take a rest from the race,
Why chase it ?
Slow down world,
Take a tip from old times.
You've seen how greed
Consumes you with its need.
Take a rest from the race
Why chase it ?
Happy is the man
Who rests when he can,
Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.
And happy is the gal
Who calls peace her pal.
If you want to be free,
You shall, you shall.
Slow down world,
Take a break for God's sake.

You just can't stop your climb
Your money-mad climb up to the top,
Don't you just glance at the chance,
Why waste it ?
Don't chase it,
Why waste it ?

Who rests when he can,
Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.

Who calls peace her pal.

And released bonds of shame-sex

And the great Unknown Tomorrow

They heard the bell of peace ring

They saw you give up meats and sweets
And practice control passion
And all this done stoned, on the run
And through the Veil went crashing
They saw you gain a mantra

As the chains of the flesh left me
As the moans and the groans

I flashed ... that my soul was Unharmed
As my earth form I shed
That the image of death had been
A thought in my head
And the truth was a spirit am I
I sussed ... that my life had been a lesson
Chosed by me
For to purify my Soul that I may be
Worthy to shine forth the Light

As I moved ever up-ward
A Great Light there came
More feeling than seeing
And it filled me with Shame
Like a Bright Shining mirror reflecting my being
My present condition of Soul I was seeing

That shone forth the Light
With love vibes they met me
A cast off my fright

I praised the Great Souls of the Ages
Who care for our needs
Who lovingly nurture
Wisdom's bright seed
Showing the way to the Light

I ached ... for the womb and the Earth
And another time around
Seking circumstances
The best that can be found
To give me the lessons to learn

And through teens I fought fiercely
For my vision of the Light

Reflects my tiny image once again

Walk along and talk along and live your lives quite freely
But leave our children with their toys of peppermint and candy.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
Your thoughts they are of harlequin, your speeches of quicksilver,
I read your faces like a poem, kaleidoscope of hate words.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
On the quilted battlefields of soldiers dazzling made of toy tin
The big bomb like a child's hand could sweep them dead just so to win.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
As you fill your glasses with the wine of murdered negroes
Thinking not of beauty that spreads like morning sun-glow.
Seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
I pray your dreams of vivid screams of children dying slowly
And as you polish up your guns your real self be reflecting.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
Vietnam, your latest game, you're playing with your blackest Queen
Damn your souls and curse your grins, I stand here with a fading dream.

Oh, I was born with the name Geraldine
With hair coal black as a raven.
I travelled my life without a care,
Ah, but all my love I was savin'.
Oh, the winds blew high and the trees did sway,
Not much from life was I askin'.
Till I met someone to give all my love,
All my love, so long an' lasting.
Oh, good were the parts we played in our game
And a long ways off was tomorrow.
But my love was a rambler and restless as the sea,
And in the tide came sorrow.
Oh, a child of the night is goin' to be born,
I can't explain my confusion.
Is my love thinkin' to marry me at all
Or of the freedom he thinks he'll be losin'?
I sit with my friends in the gay crowded room,
My friends they're smokin' and a-talkin'.
But it all seems so empty, my love is not there,
So I'll go into the streets a-walkin'.
My baby is a-growin' as a-growin' it must,
If I were to lose it, it would grieve me.
My love is so helpless and I'm wonderin' what to do.
Oh, how I yearn to help him.
Oh, we could go to the land of your choice
Where the false shame won't come knockin' at our door.
I've a feeling in my heart and it's crushing all my hopes,
I think I'm gonna be hurt some more,
Oh, I was born with the name Geraldine,
With hair coal black as a raven.
I travelled my life without a care,
Ah, but all my love I was savin'.



",The Ballad of Geraldine
Donovan,"From the album fairytale

As a pilgrim I did go
To a land that I did know,
To the shores of Trist la Cal,
To see if I still felt
The same.
And the sun blazed madly insane,
But the seagulls they have gone,
The seagulls they have gone.
I searched the sand for sound,
My eyes forced to the ground.
The wind it laughed wild and shrill,
My heart it tried to spill
Its crazy tears.
There is nothing left for me now
For the seagulls, they have gone,
The seagulls, they have gone.
I stand both young and old
But the winds of time blow cold.
This much you must believe:
It pains to see you grieve.
I pity you,
But there is nothing that I can do
For the seagulls, they have gone,
The seagulls, they have gone.
As a pilgrim I did go
To a land that I did know,
To the shores of Trist la Cal,
To see if I still felt
The same.
And the sun blazed madly insane,
But the seagulls, they have gone,
The seagulls, they have gone.

Give me one more chance, the day is near.

The yellow corn lies in your hand.
And with the night comes sorrow
As the tide of dawn sleeps on the land.
The long breezes are blowing
All down the sky into my face.
I've a weary kind of feeling,
Like my time has come and gone to waste.

As she lies here on my breast.

And I gave it to the river deep.

Where you lay, so long in sleep.

Once in a town in the black forest a little white toy-shop stood.
And the little tin soldier with only one leg lived in a castle of wood.
And across the room on another shelf stood a little glass case,
And a tiny ballerina lived in there all in her dress of lace.
And from where the little tin soldier stood they could see each other so clear
And the little tin soldier watched over her with a love that was so dear.
Then one day sadness came: the tiny ballerina was sold.
The little tin soldier was thrown away and into the gutter he rolled.
The water carried him to the sea and many far-off lands.
He made many children happy as he passed through their tiny hands.
And then one day they met again in a house in the land of Eire
And when the clocks on the wall struck the midnight hour
They jumped into a fire
And in that fire they shall stay
Forever and a day
For the fire, Lord, is the fire of love,
Just like the peaceful dove.

Cat's a-sleeping in the sun,
Eyes take heed the colours call.
Sunlight patterns touch the wall,
Red kerchiefs sail and fall,
Cat's a sleeping in the sun.
Dragon kite in the sky,
Wheel and turns, spin and fly,
Attacked by rooks and never fail
To cry the sound of fairy tales.
The cat is walkin' in the sun.
All the pebbles I have seen,
Precious stones for Colleen.
Every minute I pass through
With the grooves spent with you.
The cat is yawning in the sun.
Jewelled castles I have built
With freak feelings of guilt.
And the words stab to the hilt,
Pick the flower and it will wilt,
Cat's a-shifting in the sun.
Marionette dangles death
Insensitivity is fed.
By the TV wizard's wand
Once in the spell you're conned,
Cat's a-smiling in the sun.

Eyes take heed the colours call.

Red kerchiefs sail and fall,
Cat's a-smiling in to me.

Bobbed in an eating scene.

Smearing their eyes on the crazy Kali goddess
Listenin' to sounds of Mingus mellow fantastic.

""My, my"", they sigh.

In dull house rooms with coloured lights swingin'
Strange music boxes sadly tinklin'
Drink in the sun shining all around you.

Sadness is in your eye
Who could have made you cry?

Roll along the sleepy dream, deep
Roll along the sleepy dream, deep

Salty tear down your cheek
Drowning the words you speak.
My lullaby can dry your every care
Roll along the sleepy dream, deep
Roll along the sleepy dream, deep

Sweet dream, my baby lie
Here in my arms tonight
Don't cry I'll hold you tight,
And soothe all your worriy away.

Roll along the sleepy dream, deep

And soothe all your worries away.

If you had any sense, you'd maybe go away for a few days
Be that as it may, you can only say you are lonely

Cafe on, milk gone, such a sad light and fading.
Yourself you touch, but not too much. 
You hear it's degrading.

The flowers on your stockings wilting away in the midnight
The book you are reading is someone's opinion of moonlight
Your skin is so white, you'd like maybe to go to bed soon
Just closing your eyes if you're to rise up before noon

High heels, car wheels, all the losers are groovin'
Your dream, strange scene, images are movin'

Your friends they are making a pop star or two every evening
You know that scene backwards, they can't see the patterns they're weaving
Your friends they're all models but you soon got over that one
You sit in your one room a little brought down in London

Donovan,"On a lone and windy hilltop beneath a roof of tin
In a little wallpapered bedroom I done my growin'
'Twas there I dreamt my dreams, I hung my jeans
And wandered through my puberty as all do

My mother was a tight nut bound up with false guilt
Strapped up in her fearing wall she had built
The independent girl in a dark and cruel world
She'd lost the way to say, ""OK, now lay back""

We disagreed on most things, I shouted peace and love
The family is mankind, the symbol of the dove
She only saw the surface of things before her face
But I was young and argued on for hours

My father he liked poetry, a scholar he might have made
Had nothing, born a poor boy barefoot and underpaid
So the man worked with his hands up and down the land
His dreams forgot he thought that I must follow

With his marks as worker's wisdom he'd read a thing or two
He once had been a Mason but he never followed through
Always kind and thoughtful, smelling of mushy oil
And he read me poetry of visionaries

I flunk my way to college, a looser kind of school
But we bobbed and played time arty, feeling cool
Just to live an artists diggin' the ravin' scene
Reading Kerouac and Ginsberg well deuced

I was not academic, Art and English neat
The history of mankind I liked that a bit
And what was I to do? The choices they were few
I done right disgrace to the working classes

I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes

Donovan,"The long gone breezes are blowing down the sky.
From my window to the street I cast my weary eye.
Everything is quiet in the lonesome dusky night.
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I remember the days when the sun was warm with love
Softening as the day grew old in dazzling streaks of gold.
Now my days are bleek, the sunset's the cruellest time
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I feel I want to ramble to the shores of the mighty sea
Pounding in my ears the wind so wild and free
To stumble in the high grass, the sand a-glowin' white
My eyes they fill, they break and spill the darkness of my night.
My sorrow is confusing, my love will never know
My empty hands they lie down by my sides so low
I walk this sleeping town and the highway in-between bright
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
Riding feathered wings to make like I'm a dove
Oft I've heard the world as it cries out for some love
Cries out for some warmth, a little compassion and light
They're feeling so alone in the darkness of their night.

An' my belly is craving, I got shakin' in my head
I feel like I'm dyin' an' I wish I were dead
If I lived till tomorrow it's gonna be a long time
For I'll reel and I'll fall and rise on codine
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
When I was a young man I learned not to care
Wild whiskey, confronted I often did swear
My mother and father said whiskey is a curse
But the fate of their baby is many times worse
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
You'll forget your woman, you'll forget about man
Try it just once, an' you'll try it again
It's sometimes you wonder and it's sometimes you think
That I'm a-living my life with abandon to drink
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
Stay away from the cities, stay away from the towns
Stay away from the men pushin' the codine around
Stay away from the stores where the remedy is found
I will live a few days as a slave to codine
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
An' my belly is craving, I've got a shakin' in my head
An' I've started heating whether my body said
Steady yourself with the grains of cocaine
An' you'll end dead or you'll end up insane
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
An' my belly is craving, I got shaking in my head
I feel like I'm dyin' an' I wish I were dead

Please darling Tangerine Eyes sing a song for me,
One that I can hear all the day.
Oh and please darling Tangerine Eyes kiss my hand at dawn
By the bright and yellow corn of your hair.
Like a picture of the golden sunset you can make it real,
You know just how I feel all the time.
So please darling Tangerine Eyes whisper to the wind
We'll leave the rain behind and walk away.
We walk along the lonesome shoreline listening to the sea,
Talking to you and me about the sky
And we know even as we walk that way before the dawn
Our footsteps will be gone far away.
The seagulls ride the winds for you, can't you hear them cry,
Can't you hear them sigh out your name?
Oh please darling Tangerine Eyes sing a song for me
One that I can hear
So I feel alright

How little do you speak of beauty, isn't it a shame, what ho
Maybe you should go get a power ring, you'd make all your troubles go.

There is a something that I cannot name.
I know not after what my soul aspires
Nor guess from when the restless longing came
But ever from my childhood have I felt it
In all things beautiful, in all things gay
And ever has its gentle unseen presence
Falling like a shadow cloud across my way.

It is the melody in all sweet music
In all fair forms it is the hidden grace.
In all I love, a something that escapes me,
Flies by pursuit and ever visits face.

I feel it in the very breathing of the air.

When I do, well I know it is not there.

Donovan,"Gaily bedight, a gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Did journey long, singing a song
In search of Eldorado

But he grew old, this knight so bold
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found no spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado

Over the mountains of the moon
Down the valley of the shadow
?Ride boldly, ride the shade?, replied
?If you seek for Eldorado?

And as his strength failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow
""Shadow"", said he, ""Where can it be
This land of Eldorado?""

Over the mountains of the moon
Down the valley of the shadow
?Ride boldly, ride the shade?, replied

Without your golden love
No treasure rich enough

A night not spent with you

The light within your eyes
No star I gaze at
Brighter in these skies
No sadness deeper than
This longing for you
I'd give it all up
To be with you

There's a light
That shines on me
And the lady of the lamp she
Lies by me and holds on tight
In my mind
In constand mind

Yet sincere
And the lady of the lamp fears
Nothing. She's the mystic kind
In this life
In this dark vale
One is rarely truly loved
And the lady of the lamp loves
Only me I am her grail

Apart yet a part of ev'rything
Nothing done and all is well
Never used yet always full

So many more things to do,
I intend to come right through them all with you.

We talk a while by a crooked stile,
You're lucky to catch a few.

It's a pleasure to be true.
In my crystal halls a feather falls
Being beautiful just for you
But that might not be quite true, that's up to you.

A strange young girl sang her songs for me
And left 'fore the day was born.

Parting her veil with a sigh.

Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets

Came walking down this street
He wore a shoe upon his head
And hats upon his feet,

He raised the shoe and smiled at me
His manners were polite
But never had I seen before
Such a funny sounding sight

He said : Â«Â Allow me to present
Your highness with a roseÂ Â»
An taking out a current bun
He held it ti his nose

Staggered back against the wall
And the I answered : Â«Â well,
I never saw a rose with such
A funny looking smellÂ Â».

He the began to sing a song
Mmmmmm.........................
And sat down on the ground
You never heard in all yollur life
Such a funny feeling sound

Â«Â My friend, why do you wear
2 hats upon your feet?Â Â» I said
He turned the other way about
And hopped on his head.

You may search a thousand books
You may seek friend's consolation
And their sympathetic looks

They can't tell you what to do
They ain't got no words for you
Only you know what to do with your broken heart...
Only you know what to do with your broken heart.

All around you life has fallen
You watch the pieces scatter fast
Your lover heeds another calling
Now you're living in the past...

They can't tell you what to do
They ain't got no words for you
Only you know what to do with your broken heart.

Para viajar a otros planetas
Por corrientes circulares
Te di una cápsula especial
Pero ahora tú cabeza
Es una tormenta de arena
Y cada noche una espiral

Y cuando llega el nuevo día
Me juras que cambiarías sí
Pero vuelves a caer
Te dolerá todo el cuerpo
Me buscarás en el infierno
Porque soy igual que tú

Todo lo que siento por ti
Sólo podría decirlo así
Todo lo que siento por ti
Sólo sabría decirlo así

Todo lo que siento por ti
Sólo podría decirlo así
Todo lo que siento por ti
Sólo sabría decirlo así

Doriand,"Je passe ma vie dans les piscines
J'aime bien que les choses soient carrées
Sur mon matelas, oui je bouquine
Entre Miami et L.A.

On veut m'éjecter de mon siège
On veut me voir couler au fond
Mais comme un p'tit bouchon de liège
Et hop! Je remonte d'un seul bond

Oh, croyez moi j'ai la peau dure
Elle ne crant ni le soleil, ni le chlore
J'en vois qui comptent leurs brûlures
Moi, j'affiche un bronzage couleur or

Dans les piscines
Moi, je reste en surface
Juste au dessus des profondeurs
Mais toujours à la même place
Pendant que les autres font des longueurs

L'amour m'attend dans un bain moussant
Qu'on me rappelle son prénom
Je le rejoins dans un instant
Et cette fois, je vais aimer pour de bon

J'ai des cuisiniers et leurs étoiles
Un jardinier sous mes palmiers
Un skipper pour mettre les voiles
Oh, j'aime être entouré de gens passionés
C'est ça, des gens qui aiment leur métier, voyez?

Mon eau est toujours impeccable
Y'a un petit robot qui nettoie
Il faut le voir, c'est adorable
Aspirer les fourmis qui se noient

Dans les piscines
Moi, je reste en surface
Juste au dessus des profondeurs

Mais toujours à la même place
Je suis le messie
Qui vient vous remercier

Si au hasard d'un listing
Votre nom est souligné
Alors vous irez faire des longueurs
Des longueurs

",Dans Les Piscines
Doriand,"Dans tes yeux, on n'y voit pas très clair
On a beau allumer la lumière
Y'a toujours un regard qui me fuit
Et dire que c'est lui qui me poursuit

Et j'ausculte
Comme un médecin maniaque
L'infini dans leur bleu démoniaque
J'y plonge en secret pendant que tu dors
Certain d'y trouver des îles au trésor

Je veux savoir, quitte à m'y noyer
Dans le fond de tes yeux qui tu es
Je n'ai pas peur de toutes ces guerres inutiles
Que j'ai perdues en un seul battement de cils

Et aprfois, j'y fais venir des larmes
Ca fait louped...mais le bon Dieu d'acharne
A c'que le soleil brille sur toi
C'est quand même étrange
Ces microclimats

Je veux savoir, quitte à m'y noyer
Dans le fond de tes yeux qui tu es
Je n'ai pas peur de toutes ces guerres inutiles
Que j'ai perdues en un seul battement de cils

Dans tes yeux on n'y voit pas très clair
Dans le fond, ça commence à me plaire

Mais j'garde ma place dans le coeur

Elle passent chez moi
Quand elles ne vont pas bien la nuit
J'leur fait des p'tits plats
Il paraît que j'ferais un bon mari
Puis elles s'endorment

Tout au fond de mon vieux pull over
Elles rient elles pleurent
Faut que personne ne sache
Où elles se cachent

S'en vont très tôt le matin
Sans faire de bruit

Et leurs bienheureux
Qui font tant de larmes sous leurs yeux
On se rappelle
Mais promis je n'dirai rien

C'est pour
C'est pour leur bien

Je suis leur meilleur confident
Oui mais jamais l'amant brûlant
J'attends, j'attends

C'est vrai je suis un imposteur
Mais j'garde ma place dans le coeur

Et vous abandonnent sous un porche

Alors, un soir je pleurais
Au fond du Jack bar, rue d'Orsel
Un vicking est entré
M'a trouvée belle

Je suis la femme d'un vrai biker
J'ai pris le coeur
D'un mec qui monte à deux cents à l'heure

Et sur son bras, ""Cathy"", c'est moi
Il dit qu'il m'aime et je le crois
Johnny Flyer ne triche pas

Les seins nus sous mon blouson à franges
C'est bien moi dans le rétroviseur
Grisée de vibrations étranges
Quand Johnny fait hurler le moteur

Qu'importe où il va, je le suis
Est c'que j'ai la'ir d'une, baby doll?
Moi, je sais qui je suis
Rock 'n' roll

Une bière à la main
Avec Johnny, et je ris

Doris Cales,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

It is seldom that a dream comes true,

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

Your baby talk and baby walk and curly hair; 
Your baby smile makes life worth while,

No wonder, dearie, that I'm wild about you, 
And all the cunning things you said and did. 
Why, I love to fondly recall,

The same sweet, cunning, Little Baby dear to me.

Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.

In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.

And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,

Ten cents a dance
that's what they pay me,
gosh, how they weigh me down!
Ten cents a dance
pansies and rough guys,
tough guys who tear my gown!
Seven to midnight I hear drums.
Loudly the saxophone blows.
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums.
Customers crush my toes.
Sometime I think
I've found my hero,
but it's a queer romance.
All that you need is a ticket,
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance.

Fighters and sailors and bowlegged tailors
can pay for their ticket and rent me!
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbors
are sweethearts my good luck has sent me.
Though I've a chorus of elderly beaux,
stockings are porous with holes at the toes.
I'm here till closing time,
Dance and be merry, it's only a dime.

Sometime I think
I've found my hero,
But it's a queer romance.
All that you need is a ticket.
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance.",Ten Cents a Dance [Short Version][*]
Doris Day,"You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes
And you made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love, it's true
Yes I do, deed I do
You know I do

Give me, give me, what I cry for
You've got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
You know you made me love you

Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise

Hey there, you on that high flying cloud
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think some day she'll come to you

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She has dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care

Won't take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear

Is it all going in one ear
And out the other

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care

Won't you take this advice

Once-a-year day

Doris Day,"Love, are you nuts?
Some people can't tell when it hits them! 

All you gotta do is say hello to a man
And they've got you whispering in his ear

All you gotta do it seems is work for him
And they've got you going beserk for him

If there's a guy you merely have a bicker with
They've got you setting the wedding date

It seems they've just gotta have some dirt 
To bend your ear with

So before you start, I herewith state

I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a bit, not a mite
Though I'll admit he's quite a hunk o' guy
But he's not my cup o' tea, not my cup o' tea, not he
Not an ounce, not a pinch
He's just an inch too sure of himself for me

Well of course you've noticed his manly physique and that look in his eyes
Say, I'm sure he can cut most any man down to size
He must he as fierce as a tiger when he's mad
And I'll bet he cries like a little boy when he's sad

But I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a straw, not a hair
I don't care if he's as strong as a lion
Or if he has the rest of ya sighin'
You may be sold, but this girl ain't buyin'
I'm not at all in love!

She's not at all in love, not at all in love, oh no
Not a pin, not a crumb
Must be the summer heat that gives her that glow
'Cos she's not at all in love, not at all in love, she cries
Not a snip, not a bite
Must be the light from the ceiling shining there in her eyes

He's young and handsome, and smart, and we can't get over it
But this lady's heart he doesn't effect a bit
It's easy to see that her daffy grin is the grin she always wears
And she's breathless because she ran up a flight of stairs
Obviously!
Naturally!
Definitely!
Obviously!
Naturally!
Definitely!
Hah!

She's not at all in love, not at all in love, not she
No, I'm not!
Not a dot
Not a touch
No, not much
When I fall in love, there will be no doubt about it
'Cos you will know from the way that I shout it
Your shouting
I haven't fallen
She hasn't fallen

She's not at all in love!",I'm Not at All in Love

The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo

The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Doris Day,"I'm a girl, and by me that's only great!
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy,
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy.

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place.
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy,
Like a filly who is ready for the race!

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curl,
I float as the clouds on air do,
I enjoy being a girl!

When men say I'm cute and funny
And my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,
I just lap it up like honey
I enjoy being a girl!

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers,
I drool over dresses made of lace,
I talk on the telephone for hours
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl like me.

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl,
It goes to my head like brandy,
I enjoy being a girl!

When someone with eyes that smoulder
Says he loves ev'ry silken curl
That falls on my iv'ry shoulder,
I enjoy being a girl!

When I hear the compliment'ry whistle
That greets my bikini by the sea,
I turn and I glower and I bristle,
But I happy to know the whistle's meant for me!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl like me.

Doris Day,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Doris Day,"This is a man who thinks with his heart
His heart is not always wise
This is a man who stumbles and falls
But this is a man who tries
This is a man you'll forgive and forgive
And help and protect as long as you live

He will not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say
Something wonderful

The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do
Something wonderful

He has a thousand dreams 
That won't come true
You know that he believes in them  
And that's enough for you

You'll always go along
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He is wonderful
He'll always need your love
And so he'll get your love

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

But my busy mind is burning
To use what learning I've got.

I won't waste any time,
I'll strike while the iron is hot.

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look.

I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget.

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot.

Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers a friend.

Use to hate to go to school
I never cracked a book;
I played the hook.

Never answered any mail;
To write I used to think was wasting ink.

It was never my endeavor
To be too clever and smart.

A longing to write in my heart.

Doris Day,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen
Doris Day,"When it's beau night
In Hotchkiss Corner
You'll find the gang out
At Harem's hangout

Slipping all their nickels in the jukebox
And jivin' madly

As with girlies in gingham, swingin'
Like they do up at the savoy
You should see them
When they do the turkey in the floor

After dancin'

To pumpkin hollow

There to kiss and cuddle
And to hold tight

Because it's beau night

Sung by Frankie Boy or Mr. C
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Not for me, all that stuff
Not for me, had enough

You know what to do with good old tea for two
And the girl for you, the boy for me
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea
'Cause love and I we don't agree","Put 'Em in a Box, Tie 'Em With a Ribbon (And Throw 'Em in the Deep ...)"
Doris Day,"Picture you upon my knee, 
Just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you
And you for me alone.

Nobody near us
To see us or hear us,
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations.
We won't have it known, dear,
That we own a telephone, dear; 

Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.

We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?",Tea for Two
Doris Day,"'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!
You should care for me!
'S awful nice! 'S paradise!
'S what I love to see!

You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!
That you should care for me!

Yes, you've made my life so glamorous

Doris Day,"Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause
Because you're mine! because you're mine!
 
Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine

Doris Day,"Dozens of girls[guys] would storm up;
I had to lock my door,
Somehow I couldn't warm up
To one before.
What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.
Lady[Baby], listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat,
And you'll get just what I mean.

Embrace me,
My sweet embraceable you.
Embrace me,
You irreplaceable you.
Just one look at you - my heart grew tipsy in me.
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me.
I love all
The many charms about you;
Above all,
I want my arms about you.
Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa - come to papa - do!
My sweet embraceable you.

Doris Day,"You are a picture no artist could paint
But you're a mixture of devil and saint
I just sigh and dream and try to figure you out!
Love is in season, the moon's  up above
Tho' it be treason to question your love
Ev'rytime I look at you My heart's in doubt
 
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a feelin' you're havin' fun
I'll get a goby when you are done foolin' with me
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a notion it's make believe
I think you're laughin' right up  your sleeve 
Foolin' with me
Life is worth living while you are giving moments of paradise
You're such a stand out 
But how you handout that hokus, pokus from your eyes
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a feelin' it's all a frame
It's just the well known old army game foolin' with you

Doris Day,"Talk to her please, Mr. Sun
Speak to her, Mr. Rainbow
And take her under your branches, Mr. Tree

Whisper to her, Mr. Wind
Sing to her, Mr. Robin
And Mrs. Moonlight, put in a word for me

Tell her how I feel
It shouldn't end this way

Doris Day,"You keep me waitin' till it's gettin' aggravatin',
You're a slow poke, 
I wait n' worry but you never seem to hurry, 
You're a slow poke, 

Time means nothin' to you, I wait and then, 
Late again, 
Eight o'clock, nine o'clock, 
Quarter to ten, 

Why should I linger ev'ry time you snap your finger, 
Little slow poke, 
Why can't you hasten when you see the time's a-wastin', 
You're a slow poke, dear, 

Why should I keep tryin' to change you, 
It's not the thing to do, 
I guess i'll have to learn 
To be a slow poke too! 

You keep me waitin' till it's gettin' aggravatin',
You're a slow poke, 
I wait n' worry but you never seem to hurry, 
You're a slow poke,

Doris Day,"Take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

Lost my heart in the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
Where the pines are so high
That they kiss the sky above

And when I get that lonesome feelin'
And I'm miles away from home
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains
Callin' me back home

So take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

And when I get that lonesome feelin'
And I'm miles away from home
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains
Callin' me back home

So take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

To the beautiful Indian country
That I love",The Black Hills of Dakota
