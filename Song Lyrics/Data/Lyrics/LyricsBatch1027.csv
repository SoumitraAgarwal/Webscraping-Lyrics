Microdisney,"On the clifftop,
Of the blessed,
He flaps his elbows and he
Wears a dress,

Soon he's flying,
Over town,
He sees the floods, the fires, he laughs,
Turning to the clouds,
They called him weak and they were wrong,
Cause Angel knows where he belongs.

[Chorus]
Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.
Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.

So sue your baker,
Sue your tailor,
And your childhood sweetheart too,
And anyone who knows.
With wings of white and skin of blue,
Tomorrow belongs to you.

Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.

I've got a message for you.
I've got a message for you,
All the tortured boys and girls,
Can go where he has gone.

[Chorus]",Angels
Microdisney,"Transit Moscow, 3:50 am,
The road and the sign and the rain,
He sees the border guards
Gaping at his tank,
And says: Open that gate
While you still can,
I am the armadillo man.

It does not matter
What country you are in,
Just stay here on base
With your own kind,
But he knew a patriot
Needs a strong free hand,
Now he's off to torch
That red-infested land,
Can't stop the armadillo man.

High-gabled houses
Loom through the rain,
He's on course for destiny,
With a whoosh and a whistle and a bang,
Bye bye armadillo man.

Least he went to see the other side,
While other people never even tried.",Armadillo Man
Microdisney,"We went to a cheap hotel,
A no soap no sleep hotel,
The difference and for public scorn.
In the dead town where we were born,
How I hoped you wouldn't change your mind.
But until it was time to find,
She was even crazier than I

[Chorus]
In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.

This the night before,
We've had a little
And we want some more,
It changed the world
And it makes us sweat,
Make no promises make no threats.

And I gave her what I give you now,
It was weak and it was built on sand.
And she, with both her hands.

[Chorus]

With the ghosts.

I heard you ran off to America,
She has position and possessions now,
And I bet you can't remember how.

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
We held my hands
Up to her face
And said damn this place
All

[Chorus]",Big Sleeping House
Microdisney,"I went to see
Mrs Simpson,
Up ten flights of stairs.
My aunt had died,
Leaving me millions,
Which I wanted to share.

Door was closed,
Locked and barred,
The sign read sealed forever.
Should not have come,
Summers gone,
The year hangs tarred and feathered.

Like head on legs,
Rest of a person,
Somewhere in between.
I took the lot,
Taking you over,
All crazy and mean.

What we did and said in this place,
No one will ever know so what's your discrace?
Here comes broken backs and bloody tears.
The air's thick and black and you disappeared.

I went up,
To see Mrs Simpson,
But she was not there.
She may have gone,
Back to her husband,
But I don't really care.

Broken backs,
Heart attacks,
Don't help keep me sober.
I should not have come,
Cause what I've done,
Is done and gone and over.

So hard luck,
I won't own up,
At your inquest come December.
Its world war six,
Or twenty one,
The sense has gone its over.
Over and done.",Mrs. Simpson
Microdisney,"I must not do this thing,
I'll wreck my social life,
They'll disinfect my chair 
And claim some uncivil rights.
They'll say you son of a gun,
Old lovers pleading.
Why?

I'll say go and ask your friend the hack
He's putting straight the record track,
Here comes the sun,
Black is back.
Ask him why he turns his back,
On the innocents upon the rack,
Saves his sympathy for rats.

The doctor is a fool,
He's just a callous snob,
He had 15 years in a Jesuit school,
And now he's not fit for any job,
He just sneers and he drives a big car,
Is this my savior,
A tale to tell.

Go and ask your friend the hack
He's putting straight the record track,
Lets spend the night,
Here it comes, get back.

There's nothing wrong with me,
I am just wonderful,
I've got pop songs to keep me calm,
And faithful friends like you.
So if you ever need a view,
At my barbed wire rainbow,

Go and ask your friend the hack,
He's dancing to his record track,
You paranoid,
You paranoid.

This is what we call a rack, moron,
This is what we call a rack.
You're just a straight,
And you asked for it,
This is what we call a rack,
This is what we call a rack.",Rack
Microdisney,"Got a peaceful feeling
I've found the reason
For taking nothing seriously.
Its the guessing game with
Those waves of flame and,
Sick winter for a thousand years
Me and my ex-lover
Will accept each other,
Help reap the dead harvest,
Town to town.

She's nervous and her
Best friend is waiting,
She's trying to pronounce my name.
Talk all we may she
Can't but conceal
The fullness of her secret heart.
Its our lives,
Its nothing, don't touch me,
Don't call me,
I can't wake up.
Can't help you,
Someone else will,
If you just sit still.

When the daily parade of the troubles you made gets you down,
Just consider the fate of the wide open space from town to town.

Get Olso, get Glasgow
Hit Bonn and hit Bordeaux,
Fry Dresden, fry Dublin,
Why don't you call me?
I've got nobody.

When the daily parade of the troubles you made gets you down,
Just consider the fate of the wide open space from town to town.
When the daily parade of the troubles you made gets you down,
Just consider the fate of the wide open space from town to town.",Town to Town
Mid South,"Eight years old with my Louisville slugger
My Daddy said ""Keep your eye on the ball
There'll be times when you lose the big game
But keep your chin up whenever you fall""

If you're gonna love, love faithful
If you're gonna learn, learn by teaching
If you're gonna fall, fall reaching

She said ""hello"" and I fell apart
I took her hand and I held it forever

If you're gonna win, win graceful
If you're gonna love, love faithful
If you're gonna learn, learn by teaching
If you're gonna fall, fall reaching

Playin' ball with my son
Teachin' him all that I know

Mid South,"Through the tin pan alley in the dead of the 

Night riding that crazy horse through the

Mid-South Disaster,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Middle Brother,"Sometimes I wish I were more mysterious
Hair in my face and short conversation
I gotta friend who speaks but doesn't talk.
And I can play the part alright,
But I didn't make it up.

I'm ready to lose my mind when it suits me
And if you found a fool-proof way,
Just slide it under the table
Just sneak it into my pocket

'Cause I want to sing with blood and guts
And I want them to sing with me too
I want to sing with blood and guts
Instead I'm singing to you.

Sometimes I wish that I cared you were leaving
I guess if I did then you probably wouldn't
You said you gotta problem with me acting tough
I don't know where you get this stuff.

I heard you're frequenting with older guys from private schools
The ones that I openly thought would be bad for you
If you're breaking my heart
You wont get no help from me
But I kinda wish it work
I think a broken heart is what I need.

If I'm gonna sing with blood and guts
Then try to help me on my way
I wanna sing with blood and guts
Instead I push them away.

You were so pretty with your hands on my throat
Or how you start crying when I ask for my coat.
I don't miss the parts I've forgotten
I said nothing, and nothing it's not

I just wanna get my fist through some glass.
I just wanna get your arm in a cast.
I just want you to know that I care.

I'm gonna sing with blood and guts.
But I'm always doing it wrong.
I want to sing with blood and guts
Instead I'm singing along

The older we get, the older we are.
I woke up this morn driving my car
And that is not how it's supposed to be.

Am I killing time or is it killing me?

And I wanna sing with blood and guts
So someone will know that I'm here
I wanna sing with blood and guts

I want to sing with blood and guts
I want them to sing with me too
Oh
I wanna sing with blood and guts,
Instead I'm singing to you
Instead I'm singing to you
Instead I'm singing to you",Blood and Guts
Middle Brother,"Her blue eyes are turning green
But mine have always been that way
Soft kisses are hard to buy
Been knocked down since yesterday

A black eye and a blue heart
And a blue heart and your soft kiss
Don't get me started by holding your hand
You'll send my ass to the hospital again

I've been lookin' for some time
In a room full of pennies for my dime
Well it ain't easy to find
A girl like you to be mine

Just a look at you made my heart skip
And a think of you does jumping-jacks
Told myself that you're the one
And I told myself I could get you back
When I came back you still weren't mine
Then I left again and you still weren't mine
I'm back again so just be mine
I am so tired of runnin'

I've been looking for some time
In a room full of numbers for my prime
But it ain't easy to find
A girl like you to be mine

She's a southern girl without a drawl
She's a good girl who wears black bras
Only one who could make me crawl
But she's just too sweet to force me

Got a hard head but not on her
I got a foul mouth that she's never heard
Hear her sing just like a bird
She'll write a song about me

Middle Brother,"Early in the morning, too hungover to go back to sleep
Every sound is amplified, every light so dizzying
Listen for a while to the neighbors having sex
Wishing I could lay my aching head upon your breast

Can't I dream another dream?
Can't I close my eyes and wander back to sleep?

But I'm daydreaming about you
I know that it's wrong
That I'm daydreaming about you
Yes, I've been daydreamin' for so long

A Bloody Mary afternoon, waste my time out in the sun
Hum myself some melodies, baby I could sing you one
Maybe I could find you sitting down at the cafe
Maybe I could join you at your table today

Can't I just get what I want?
Can't I be the man that steals away your heart?

But I'm daydreaming about you
I know that it's wrong
That I'm daydreaming about you
I've been daydreaming for so long
Hell, I've been daydreaming for so long

Later in the evening, take the bus down to see the show
You'll be behind the bar, I'll get a beer, leave the tip and lay low
I'm just a kid that gets his drinks from you
That stands around and doesn't have a clue

Can't I hold you close to me?
Can't I ever say to you just what I mean?

Get my nourishment from a punch in the gut
Never really felt I had the best of luck
I gotta big big mouth that just won't shut up

Head down the road decide to hum along

But I'm gonna learn to fly an airplane
And its gonna make my Mama proud
I'm going to get my Dad to notice me
Even if I have to fly it into the ground

I know my days are numbered but I'm bad at math
I got a dick so hard that a cat could scratch
Made some bad decisions I shouldn't go back
I cant see her, its just a not like that
You see I had this lovin' baby but I roughed her up
A little ounce of pain behind every grunt
All the noise that I make, I shouldn't complain
Regrets, tourettes, I guess it's the same

But I'm going to learn to fly an airplane
I'm gonna make my children proud
I'm gonna make their mom respect me
Like when I first showed up in town
Oh yeah!

Ain't no money comin in 'cause I got child support
Ain't a fat old woman gonna leave me alone ?
Its a terrible way to live but it ain't my choice
I signed away all of my earnings on the living room floor
Well I could be the hero on the evenin' news
Smilin' in the face of danger like there's nothing to lose
Takin' out terrorists for himself, that's me ?
Tell the kids to stay in schools and always get good grades

And I can't tell the bottom from the top 
Am I standing on my head or on my heels 
Is it cloudy, is it bright 
Is it day or is it night 
Am I wrong or am I right 
And is it real 

On and on I've drifted with the tide 
I didn't know that love could move me so 
You filled my life with love and much more besides 
And you showed me which way to go 

And I can't tell the bottom from the top 
Am I standing on my head or on my heels 
Is it cloudy, is it bright 
Is it day or is it night 
Am I wrong or am I right

Middle of the Road,"When I look through my window I only see rain
And my thoughts go back to those wonderful days
We shared together and you left without any cares
And I only have pain to remind me

We started a love right 
Then something went wrong
I tried to hold on to you
But now now that you have gone
My dreams are shattered I hold
And I thought would come true
And I only have pain to remind me now

You had me close in your arms
Your breath was one next to mine all night through
But when the morning arrived 
You left without a goodbye
And I knew I was losing you

Another rain on the window
Reminds me of tears
These lonely tears
That I've shed for you all through the years
When you find someone new you can love more than I
And I only have pain to remind me

And I only have pain to remind me now
You had me close in your arms
Your breath was one next to mine all night through

You left without a goodbye

Wrapped in many shades of green

Confused by all the things I've seen

Should I stand up, say what's on my mind
Point my finger at the wrong I find
Let it linger till another time
Or let it go?

I've seen forests turn to fields of sand
To satisfy a rich man's greed
Now the tears that fall upon this land
Won't help to grow a nation's needs

Should I shout out from the highest tower
Should I take it to the highest power
Show the plague that turns a whole world sour
Or let it go?

I seek comfort in a sea of fools
And wrap their lies around for protection
But if lies were any answer at all
We're just adding to this world infection

Can I turn and smile and kiss it away?
Leave it lying for another day
Should I fall down on my knees and pray
Or let it go?

There's a passion that destroys all the caring (ah-ah, ah-ah)
And walks across the flowers of affection (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Breaks them down into the soil we are sharing (ah-ah, ah-ah)
And leaves us with this life of rejection (ah-ah, ah-ah)

Am I strong enough to stand my ground? (ah-ah, ah-ah)

Try to keep from hell or heaven bound (ah-ah, ah-ah)

And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

Midge Ure,"Hands upon a cross I see you pray
I can hear the words you cannot say
Free your mind and you will see
Live forever, come to me

Voices of the past will hunt you down
Give yourself to me and you'll be found
Free your mind and you will see
Love will come when your soul is free
Live forever, come to me
Come with me

There is no forgetting sorrow
There is no regretting love
All we really do is borrow
All the dreams we're dreaming of
We can never know tomorrow
There is only giving love today

Something deep inside that never dies
Free your mind and you will see
Love will come when your soul is free

Midge Ure,"When I was boy 
There's a dream that I had
That a war if was fought 
Was for good against bad
And I woke up to find 
That the world had gone mad 

And we'd all fall down

And I feel like a child again
Sitting or turning
You're toying with power
Your fingers are burning
You're pushing so hard 
That the worlds won't be turning

We'll all fall down

When you try to pretend 
That you're a god upon high 
With your party ideals 
And your squeaky clean lies
When it comes to the crunch
You're no smarter than I 

And we'll all fall down

If it's colour of creed or all time religion
Well fighting for that shows 
A pure lack of vision
The fight that we strive 
Is a fight to survive 

And we'll all fall down

Well look in the mirror 
And what do you see
An American, Russian 
A soldier or me 
When you all press the buttons 
Just where will you be?

When we all fall down",All Fall Down
Midge Ure,"Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's five and I'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's late and I'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but I don't think we really care

After all the pain
The twist in my life starts healing
Just to twist again
In stillness, in sorrow

The fire inside stops burning
Just to burn again
In moments of madness
Returns that softly sighing lament

Till my kingdom comes.
Give us this day all that you showed me 
The power and the glory
Till my kingdom comes.
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory
Till my kingdom comes.
And they said that in our time 
All that's good will fall from grace.
Even saints would turn their face in our time.
And they told us that in our days
Different words said in different ways
Have other meanings from he who says in out time:
Give us this day all that you showed me 
And they said that in our time we would reap from their legacy

We would learn from what they had seen in our time.
And they told us that in our days
We would know what was high on high

We would follow and not defy in our time.
Give us this day all that you showed me 
Faithless in faith
We must behold the things we see.
Give us this day all that you showed me",Hymn

No tears goodbye

Midge Ure,"In a quiet street washed by the rain, the room within the home.
A lonely man sits cheek to cheek, with unique designs in chrome.
The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone.
He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on.

[Chorus]
New Europeans.
Young Europeans.
New Europeans.

A photograph of lovers lost, lies pressed in magazines.
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen.
Their educated son has left, in search of borrowed dreams.
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen.

[Chorus]

On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on.
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song.
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away.
He's a European legacy, a culture for today.

Name after name after name.

Hurting my eyes with their glare.

Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces,
Destined, we had to collide.

Watching the day drag away.
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers,
Rip round my throat as I dream.

With a soft unnerving ease
And all you've built around
May just tumble to the ground

With your future in another's hands

When white turns to red
In the not too distant days
Will force and misery
Be the life you have to lead?

We stand or fall
With your children in anothers world
We stand or fall
When your town is not your own

When crimson takes a hold
When the lights go down on all you've ever known
When all you'll ever do

When the freedom slips away

Midlake,"Did you ever want to be overrun by bandits
To hand over all of your things and start over new
While we were out hunting for food
Our house was being robbed
I caught an apple and she caught a fox
So I caught a rabbit but she caught an ox

So upon our return we found everything gone
Which for us was no loss
We started over with a rabbit and an ox

So they came down from the north
Carrying all they owned
With a basket full of food and clothes
They were stopped by a weekend raid
Traveling the woods one day
Tried to put up a fight but lost

With us on their way

As I move freely to a place

In the rain falls on my shame it falls, yes it falls

Like a child I'm hurtled forward
Dreaming things anew, sights I see sound true

Midnight Oil,"Here comes the mechanical sun
Working on the bones in the dry old creek bed
Mist on the old river bend yellow box hangs like it's dead
The emerald silo is rusting from the inside.

You want to run like the wind you'll never come here again
You want a world you can save so c'mon you poets and slaves.

Circus olympia pulls into town
The dwarf and the fat man head out for beer
There is no lion that roars to one can stand on the horse
Tomorrow is a no show the fortune teller cries.

You want to go down in flames you're gonna crash like the waves
You can't remember your name so come on you poets and slaves.

We got everything we need sugar and beef
We got some good ideas
We got the steering wheels and rolling stock too
Clouds came down low on the corn
Meat ants are gathering like storms
Somewhere in the quiet wild darkness a crocodile cries.

You gotta you gotta you gotta
C'mon you poets and slaves.

You got to arrest the decay you're sinking down in the bay
You can't remember your name c'mon you poets and slaves.

You've got to count what you've made
You're gonna pass like the days
Stop time and head for the stage.

And c'mon you poets and slaves
C'mon you poets and slaves.

We can fade away or start over again

The southern cross don't shine on that invisible hand

where will you live when the fields are falling?
Where will you live when the feedlots calling?
Everybody standing in the treetops saying
Where will you live? where will you live?
Everyone dosen't have to beg or borrow
Were going to move into a new tomarrow
Where will you live? where will you live?

invisable hand clutching at the throat
Statistical sham an emperor's rags its sad its so sad
Because equality's the only plea green fields are burning
The reefs on fire and bellies are swollen they're hurting
A willing victims I don''t think so
We won't be pinned agains't the wall
There is no slogan that can feed you

where will you live when the fields are falling?
Where will you live when the feedlots calling?
Everybody standing in the treetops saying
Where will you live? where will you live?
Tearing up your ticket for the new titanic
Heat haze refugee no-one panic

where will you live when the water comes over?
Where will you live? where will you live?
Take a deep breath don't have to drown in sorrow
Take a deep breath for a new tomarrow

Nothing changes but the colour changes hue
I don't come to bury you
The trouble is with you.

We got too much sunshine,

Have you ever built your house
In a town called pissitaway
You were dreaming of marinas
With a crown you were king for a day
Saw a man with a reason any season
Got a bird in his hand.

Well we do the same things that we always do
Nothing changes but the channel changes view
Well the trouble with you has been
You can sleep but you can't dream.

Midnight Oil,"In a country that we call home
In a land that's skin and bone
There's a place that's hardly known.

Mountains appearing with the sun
Rivers of light they westward run
Night is draining from the firmament.

Railway fettler broken down
On a branch line somewhere south
Off the map and off the world.

There is no end to the world that I see
There is no end to the world that I see.

As we swing from star to star
We're not going very far
The land is hard and gives no quarter.

The o'cannon garrison falls down
You cannot hear the church bell sound
The sun beats down and gives no sanctuary.

As sure as I stand on this place
The spirit comes
Let lightning strike and leave no trace.

I was all alone, I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance and there this sweet lovin' thing was

She was more than enough I asked her for her hand
Said, ""Would you like to dance?""
So pleased that I had asked, she quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam, yeah, yeah

See, I've waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand I knew you were the man
To turn my world around and make my dreams come true

The magic in your eyes made me realize
That everything I feel has got to be real

Midnight Star,"Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together, boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings and played those games of truth and dare
No, I’m not one to regret but I know I did you wrong
And it’s so hard to forget how you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings why I ever played on you
In these days of danger, I really should be true
It ain't worth those silly chances to be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever let’s remember this simple phrase

Don’t rock that boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don't fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
D-don’t do it, don’t do it
Don’t do, d-don’t, don’t

Foolishly I play the field to satisfy myself
But the true satisfaction comes from you and no one else
Ooh, you don’t have to worry ‘cause I feel the same way too
And I’ll never touch another, baby, I’m savin' my love for you

We were lucky, we found out in time
Now that we know the truth, sugar, things will work out fine
We will stay together and we’ll never drift apart
I knew just what to do to keep you in my heart

Don’t rock that boat

Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

The girl wanted love that was gigantic
But love was drfitin' like The Titanic
Not just knee deep, it was total knee deep
When the fly girl had to stop for keys

Who were rockin’ those freaks ahoy
She said to herself, “What’s wrong with that boy?”
To each other we should devote
Please love each other, stop rockin’ that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don’t fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Midnight Sun,"Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
The warlord is calling your name
Fight for your glory, and fight for your king
Into the battlezone, fight for the ring

Brothers of metal, stand up for your rights
Prepare yourself for an endless fight
Living in fear ain't living to us
Sway your sword high, like Jack the Muzz

Oh....the revelation comes
Provide us with thunder

Steel to steel
Steel to steel
Hold your hammer high
Steel to steel
Steel to steel
The gods are waiting in the sky

From the battle we come to the battle we ride
High and mighty we stand
We ride like thunder, we are punishment and pain
The weak ones bleeding in the rain",Steel to Steel
Midnight Youth,"In this life we're tested and tainted and only some make it through
But we see hope in this Garden of Eden and I'll never give it up, no

Sweet Renee she was destined for me, we had a road to drive on
But I let her sway from the headlights and I had to give her up

So I gave her - Dead Flowers, and ran away, Dead Flowers, they hit me in the wrong way

Jack and Jill they went climbing that mountain, they went to hold hands
But by the time they had got it together, the view said to give it up

'cause they saw - Dead Flowers, and ran away, Dead Flowers, they hit me in the wrong way
They hit me in the wrong way...

Now all these failures mean something, my lonely heart is a mess
All these lows have hardened my soul, but is there time for me yet?
To trust my mother was taken, for a cause so bright and true
Will you give me some time to mourn, with an angel like you?
All I want in my resting place let my roots unfurl
Well all at once I knew that I had, all at once I knew that I had hope

I'll never give up, I'll never give it up
",Dead Flowers
Midtown,"Step outside and listen.
As you cut through the tension,
The world is crumbling down around you-it's found you.
When you woke up yesterday,
There was nothing left for me to say to you
Because you wanted me to be true.
When all you feel is pain,
Ands somehow things have changed I'll be coming home to you.
When I forgot to call,
You knew it all,
It was coming down on you.
Will you still be waiting,
That's something I can't ask you to be.
Will you be still waiting for me?
I'm waiting for you and something is wrong,
But I just can't put my finger on it.
You never listened and you'll never listen now,
You know what I'm about,
But is that sufficient?
Do you hear the words I say?
It hurts when you talk that way.
You say you'll listen cause you'd like to live together lives,
But come on,
You could have any other boy to take my place and hold when you're feeling alone.
How can you say that I'm supposed to stay when you talk on to me that way?
Oh come on.
I can't see what's supposed to be,
But if you trust me it might turn ok.
What are you gonna say?

if i could chose to start it over
i'd exercise more discretion

come on
let go of those affectations
you don't fool anyone

Midtown,"This isn't about you

Just every passing day 
Leaves me wondering what is really true  
Expecting to find you sleeping soundly 

Through and through 
Sadness comes misplaced 
And ends are means by which to uncover truth 
Happiness will come when you are with the one 
Who can take you to places you never were 

But always knew 
I'm coming for the ride 
And you can say it's too safe inside 
You cannot realize it's taking time 

I'm taking it in stride 
I'm sure it's safer inside 
You just can't realize but you're such a person 
Wake up every morning, every morning 
With her name in your head, you can survive 

But you say I'm not half what I wish 
I was so much back then 
There is no end and no room for pretend 
Feeling only this, I cannot fathom it 

There's no escape from uncertain fate 
There is no excuse, why did this happen to you 
Can our lives be made up 
From what's been left in time 
You're feeling time crushing at the spine

And you're tired and I'm tired 
We're so tired, yeah 
You're tired inside 
You just can't realize what's wrong

I know they don't erase
The things that brought me down
Caused you to hurt, caused you to hate
But now I've figured out
All that we won't do

When you say I know

you're not looking
I'm still watching you
Can we forget those times
Can we move on

please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I
Can be forgiven one last time

I'm lost without your sight
I can't think without your mind
There's comfort in the night
When I wake up by your side
I'm up here on my own
With nothing left to loose
I won't deny you anything
There's nothing I'll refuse

you're not looking
I'm still watching you
Can we forget those times
Can we move on

please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I

",One Last Time
Midtown,"This time I think it could be perfect
But you'd push it away
I came here today with a purpose
Should I try or just let it go

'Cause these things I'd like to ask you
Are things I can't explain
Or should I keep your glance
Outside the porch last Saturday

Should I have succumbed to your courtesy
I could see you were trying to get my attention
But I pushed it away

This time I think it could be perfect
But you'd push it away

Tonight it seemed suddenly perfect
Still no promises made
The balance of power was shifted
Were you trying to let me in

Or was I trying so hard
That all my confidence was lost tonight
Confused and regretful, I cracked
Swallowed it back
And left with no spine intact

Maybe we were meant to see what's right
See how this ought to be
Just a taste of life to see what's right
You made sense out of me

What a shame that we're slipping away now
I'm going away now
Off to see what's out there
'Cause you're all that's here for me",Perfect
Midtown,"I can't believe anything
Every year it's the same
Chew me up
Spit me out again

Oh, I've seen it all
Winter, summer, fall
I love you with my eyes

I don't know where to go
There's no where left to go

So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Oops wrong hole what she said in the shower
Already hit the booty hole for an hour

CHORUS X 2

Ring around the rosie, pocket fulla posie

Let's go smoke an ounce up, maybe tear da house up
Gripp on her ass cause this lads got a big butt

She could pack it up make a killin in another town
Shake junt staring, I don't mean no harmin
Call me Mr. Whipple cause I want to squeeze the Charmin
Rubbbin on her back as I suck on her NIPPLE!

Got somethin poking out of that short ass dress
You know just whacha doin gal, and you a mess
With yourself, stackin wealth got me on hard
If I getcha in the bed pussy gon' fart
You da strait freak type, and I'm lovin dat

Layin down wit a man, went behind the bar
Catchin me with dope then she take the charge

Bitch, whats happenin'? Start shit but don't take it
Pull it out, put it on your ass
Some of y'all niggaz still got the game fucked up this year
But I ain't gonna have it
Tryna talk about another mother fucker on a record
And the bitch ain't got no cabbage
Hopin' somebody can tell me whats wrong with this picture
Don't think you can put out what ever you want
And I ain't gonna come back in the bitch and come getcha
I'mma find out where ya hang at
Where ya old lady live and what time you be there
Go scope out ya ride
Follow ya to work and bring that heat
Duck and woo from this fuckin' fool
Monkey see, monkey do
Nigga so you can't be the man right chea too
There's none after this not another livin' M.C. as hazardous
And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back whenever they comin' I bring that double
In a minute y'all niggaz don't show no love its gonna be trouble
These niggaz here get ya name bent
Washed up anybody y'all sent
Gotta watch these niggaz, they get outta line
Gotta put 'em in they place every time they nut up
Gotta stop 'em from spreadin' them lies
Bust 'em in they mouth and make em shut up
Get up, come here never seen me cut up, you must not be from here
Im four and none here
Don't have me to bring up the shit I've done here
Reach blazin' temperatures
So please come with ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of mutherfuckers that try to run in here
Serious look on my face and a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggaz don't want my trouble
But its too late for 'em, gotta accept this shit

Tryna like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
Tryna be like me
You would, if you could nigga

You wanna do what I do?
You would, if you could nigga

You wanna take my style?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, but you can't, so u ain't

From the moment that I slid in the door
They know I'm back 'cause you can hear it in the floor
But after I rap bitches ain't feelin' it no more
Wanna talk that shit, better know what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass better throw up before I start ballin'
And if you ever fuck with what I be recording
I'm ma flush you down the toilet
And if you ever come at me wrong with a mike
I'mma throw you in the gutter
I cant be scared these niggaz
And they disrespect me 'cause I'm from New Orleans
We don't play that shit
When these niggaz and they really want me to get started
Make it painful I don't think so
I be bustin' till I can't
Thats what I where that tank for
Hittin' with the speed of Roy Jones Jr.
And the strength of iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let 'em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just 'cause I'm rich don't mean that it don t sound hungry
Count if you wanna
Hope you think 'cause you little I won't jump on ya
You better remember that
When you be droppin' that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin' you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Y'all niggaz would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
'Cause bitch I ain't nothin' to fool with
But if it is on ya mind
You got somethin' to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid, I wouldn't be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum then fuck up my raps, semi tracks
No matter whether kickin' a verse or smokin' a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin' a habit of hurtin' they head and busting' they ass
Fuckin' they woman and takin' they spotlight, makin' 'em mad

Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine

Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today

Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think

Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof

Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cause I fell in love with my chrome plated woman

I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock

I want to know what's on your mind
Did someone hurt you
Throw your love away

If you just give me a chance
I'll promise you
I'll never let you down

In the middle of the night
Do what you want me to do
Your satisfaction is guaranteed
If you would give all your love to me

I'll never hurt you
I'll be right by your side

She begins to think she's grown,

Just about the break of day.
Want to see me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay?

One drink of wine,
Two drinks of gin.
Pretty young got me
In the shape I'm in.

Mighty Oaks,"The tale is old that tells the fate of all our lives in the hands of three
They take the thread out oh and they weave it
The first, she sings a song about the world, to tell of all that she sees
She opens her eyes up to spin on the wheel

But we could change it
Baby, let's change it

Let's escape it all (we'll escape it all)
And never look back again (won't look back again)
Baby, let's go get lost (oh let's go get lost)
And never look back again (won't look back again)

And one by one they choose the good in us, and how much evil stays
The sisters fate, oh they give and they take
The second sings a song of all that was, she tells of bygone days
She takes the thread and she measures its weight

But we could change it
Baby, let's change it

Let's escape it all (we'll escape it all)
And never look back again (won't look back again)
Baby, let's go get lost (oh let's go get lost)
And never look back again (won't look back again)

The sisters take the reins on life and say how we're to live out our days
They give you a journey and don't let it change
The third, she sings a song of what's to come, she sings of all that will be
Then she cuts your thread, that's the release

But we could change it
Baby, let's change it

Let's escape it all (we'll escape it all)
And never look back again (won't look back again)
Baby, let's go get lost (oh let's go get lost)
And never look back again (won't look back again)

Let's escape it all
And never look back again
Baby, let's go get lost
And never look back again",Never Look Back
Mighty Oaks,"Raise a glass, Raise another
One to ourselves, One to the others
Times like these, they are sweet
And oh my friends, I hope you see that

We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again

Raise a glass, Raise another
One to our past, And to what we'll discover
The days pass by, a blur in time
So get it in your head, and keep in mind that

We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again

Days, they come and go
Most will fade away in time
Days, they come and go
Most will fade away, but not today

Raise a glass, Raise another
One to our health, And one to my mother
The best ones go, before their time
Life can be a storm, but you can shine

And We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again",Raise a Glass
