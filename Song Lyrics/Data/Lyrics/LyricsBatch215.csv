Jon Brion,"From the wrinkles on my forehead
To the mud upon my shoe
Everything's a memory
With strings that tie to you

In my dream I'm often running
To the place that's out of you
Of every kind of memory
With strings that tie to you

Though a change has taken place
And I no longer do adore her
Still every God forsaken place is always
Right around the corner

Now I know it's either them or me
So I'll bury every clue
And every kind of memory
With strings that tie to you

And every kind of memory
With strings that tie to you",Strings That Tie to You
Jon Brion,"It was happy at the start
When you offered me the part
We agreed to go awhile
And it all was on a handshake and a smile
'Cause it looked okay to me
But I guess you shouldn't be too sure of yourself
And now I see that I was incorrect
But that's easier in retrospect
All my friends said what's the fuss
Don't you know these things happen to the best of us
So if you think of me as desperate
You should not even ask for it
Oh, and as for my defense
I can swear that it made sense to me at the time
So now it's safe to say 
That I really should've run the other way

I didn't think it would turn out bad",Didn't Think It Would Turn Out Bad
Jon Brion,"I may be slower than some folks
But I always make my way
I move forward with my hopes
And I sometimes save the day

Where do I begin?
Cause there?s a whirl pool of information
That you?ve got to sort through
To get to where it?s at

It falls flat and it makes you crazy
But I get the feeling
That I get what it?s about
It?s just a feeling
I can?t really spell it out
I get the feeling
That I get what it?s about

>From the bar to the car park
Theories fly about
They fall short for the most part
But I?m not keeping count

And why should I begin?
Cause there?s a whirl pool
Of people who will stop
And they will tell you
The things that you will not
They roll their eyes and they call you crazy

But you get the feeling
That you get what it's about
It?s just a feeling
You can?t really spell it out
You get the feeling
That you get what it?s about",Get What It's About
Jon Brion,"It's something unattainable
That you can't live without
And now the unexplainable
Has you riddled with doubt

Things began, things decay
And you've gotta find a way to be okay
But if you wanna spend the day
Wondering what it's all about
Go and knock yourself out

Why we're put in this mess
Is anybody's guess
It might be a test
Or it might not be anything 
To be too worried about
But if you're still in doubt
Go and knock yourself out",Knock Yourself Out
Jon Brion,"So what you're never understood
Big deal you're doomed to die
Oh nothing ever lasts
It all gets torn to shreds
If something's everlasting
It's over our heads

Think your troubles are so serious
Well one day you'll be so long gone
'cause nothing ever lasts
It all gets torn to shreds
If something's everlasting
It's over our heads",Over Our Heads
Jon Brion,"You slit your own throat
You won't be around for long
Though not a dying breed
Cause they'll always be a market for greed
And they'll always be someone to replace you

Though they may not have the courage to face you
Now it's too late to settle scores
You're going back the way you came before
Back through the revolving door

You're sick of your skin
Though you act like you're not for now
But the rot has set in and it could be as little as an hour or two
Before it completely devours you

And the ones who should stand up are afraid to
You were smug while you held the floor
You're going back the way you came before
Back through the revolving door

I understand the concessions that you make
I know what it's like to get backed into a corner
I sympathize but I don't take your side

Hey you
You act like no one could tame you
But when it counted you never came through
Well, with one look at what they paid you
Well, most folks would hardly blame you

I'm not surprised that this is what it came to
You're going back the way you came before
Back through the revolving door
And one day you could be back for more
Oh, more, oh, more, oh, no",Revolving Door
Jon Brosseau,"I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around
Jon Christopher,"Here it comes again, don't let it pass you by like the city bound train
You know it's up to us, to lead the way and march toward victory 
Standin' on the right side, who knows what's right? 
Don't look now, seems like we're trapped somehow 
I'm not sure if we'll ever make it out of here alive 
Don't look now, seems like we're trapped somehow 
Time is almost up, but the war has just begun 
We're stuck inside a place, and soon we'll have to face the outside world... 
The anger on the street begins to raise some heat, and we're almost out of time",Trapped
Jon Cleary,"You're just into looking after #1
Only thing you worry ‘bout is having your fun
First sign of trouble and it's understood
You'll get going while the going's still good
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a secret agent got a hidden agenda
Got me in your sights, think I'm a real big spender
Stick around baby pretty soon you'll see
I ain't got no money but my love's for free
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a gun for hire when a war breaks out
Loving on the front line ‘til the money runs out
Finger on the trigger, baby pull it and see
If your mercenary tactic's gonna work on me

Jon Cougar Concentration Camp,"If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man,
You win some, lose some, all the same to me,
The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say,
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
The Ace Of Spades


Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil,
Going with the flow, it's all the same to me,
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you,
Double up or quit, double stake or split,
The Ace Of Spades


You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools,
But that's the way I like it baby,
I don't wanna live forever,
And don't forget the joker!


Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me,
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again,
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die,
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,

Jon Davis,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Jon De Lucia,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Jon Dee Graham,"That's a sorry-ass piece ass of news
When I heard about you
Couldn't believe it was you

Jon Dee Graham,"Well, maybe I’ll drive up north for a while
Go and see some family
Livin’ by myself here alone on the hill
Starts to wear on me

Between the ghost in the yard and the angel in the tree
The roses in their beds get more sleep than me

Half the time, I think I’m crazy
And the other half the time, I wish I was
All the waiting I’ve done, for some sense of things to come
But it never does

When I’m driving at night, I see pictures on the windshield
The lights, the road and my picture show
I see the boys when they were babies, see Roy in the Air Force
I see things that never happened, well, they might have, I don’t know

Between the time that I leave and I arrive
The past is in the back seat with the dead of quiet

Half the time, I think I’m crazy
And the other half the time, I wish I was

Jon Eardley,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

I got stopped by a man givin' somethin' away
He gave me a picture, he gave me a sign
And a stick of incense he said was mine

So he asked me to come to a get together
The very next day, no matter the weather
There were men, there were ladies, all lookin' the same

Till they said the master would talk to me
He had a long black beard and long black hair
And he looked like a sunburnt teddy bear

So I just stopped dead and rubbed my eyes
Slapped my thigh, and split my sides
Well he just looked away with a faded air
Said you can laugh, I'm a millionaire

Well I stopped again, cleared my throat
'Cause that don't sound like a billy goat
Well I'll shave my head though I know it's a mess
But I draw the line at wearin' a dress, I say
Ooh meditation, that's the name of the game
Ooh, save the nation, that's the name of the game

Jon English,"She Was Real
It was cold and it was dark,
When I stopped my Harley,
And I looked down at my road map,
I thought I had gone too far,
It was one of those Autumn nights,
Pitch black, with a mist in the air,
When you can't see anything close up,
But you know there's someone there …
So I pulled out my flashlight,
And shone it in the night,
I heard a voice calling softly,
And I caught her in the light,
She was all dressed in jeans and leathers,
She looked lost and afraid,
And she whispered, “can you help me,
I must have lost my way?”
She was real, my heart did a somersault,
She was real, she came near,
I said, “Hey, you gave me quite a turn,
Just what the hell are you doing out here?”
She was real, she said, “I don't remember”
She was real, she looked at me,
So I said, “Where do you want to go?”
She said, “I live by the sea”,
She was real, I swear she was real …
Well I ain't no Greek statue,
But she was something to be seen,
She had this long dark hair, eyes like a cat,
She was no more than nineteen,
And you see I didn't think it right to ask,
Just why she was all alone, I just took it to be
Boyfriend trouble, so I said, “I'll take you home”.
She was real, she gave me her address,
Or else I wouldn't be here,
She was re she climbed up on the back of my bike,
And she showed no fear,
She was real, soft she put her arms around me,
She was real, she held on tight,
And she was real as we shouted our conversation,
As we thundered through the night, faster,
She was real, I swear she was real …
It was raining, and the mist was coming in,
She looked at me, she said, “Hey, I want to get home fast”, 
I told her I'd do my best,
And when I asked her out next Saturday,
God help me, she said yes,
And the wind was snatching our voices away,
But I felt good inside,
There was me and Suzy riding out there,
Just busting with pride, feeling good,
And she was real when I took the roundabout,
Just as real as the wind in my hair,
She was real when I turned to look at her,
My God, she wasn't there,
She was real, she told me her name,
I went shouting out the same,
I went stumbling through the undergrowth,
Screaming like a man in pain,
My God she must have fallen off,
But I swear I didn't feel her fall,
I went looking, searching, looking,
And then I gave the cops a call,
The cops came, found nothing,
It was sunrise when they got there,
Nine am when the searching broke,
I guess it must have been the look on my face,
That told them it weren't no joke,
So I gave them Suzy's address,
And they took me round there in the car,
I just wanted to go with them,
I couldn't face my Harley,
And Suzy's mother answered,
She had Suzy's hair and Suzy's eyes,
And when I told her what had happened,
She just broke down and she cried,
And she told me I was cruel and heartless,
To tease an old lady so, and she told me,
Suzy died on that roundabout twelve years ago …
She was real, there's a photo on the fireplace,
Dated 1965, but she was real, 
she was on the back of my bike,
she was soft, she was alive,
I swear she was real, I ain't going crazy,
I touched her and she touched me,
So I guess I'll get on back to that roundabout,
She's waiting there for me, she's waiting,
She's real, I swear she's real, she was real (2x),
I ain't crazy, she was real (2x), I ain't crazy!

I went down to Taneytown 
To see what I could see 
My mama told me never go 
But I'm almost 22 years old 
Sometimes I fear this holler swollow me

Went off with that new beau of hers 
I snuck off after dark 
Long way down the county road 
Stars were bright 
The moon was low 
Down to where the black top highway starts 

I went down to Taneytown

I went down to see what I could see 

I could see everybody stared at me 
You'd think that they ain't never seen 
A colored boy before 
They chunked at me at me 
Called me names 
They'd have whipped me sure but the sheriff came 
I slipped off through the dry goods store 
I ran down Division Street 
Some of them boys followed me 
Down to the railroad track 
Four of them and I cain't fight 
But I had my old Randall knife 
I cut that boy and I never did look back 

I went down to Taneytown 
I went down to Taneytown 
I went down to see what I could see 

Cross the fields and woods I run 
Like a bullet from a rabbit gun 
Back home to my bed 
Ma came in from Gettysburg 
Her and that new beau of hers 
""Boy you look like hell""; was all she said 

Month went by without a word 
Somebody down the holler heard 
About that boy they hung 
He begged those men to spare his life

He picked it up so they thought he was the one

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Jon Langford,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleading in my nose
I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me
They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
The girl I loved so well

Shot through the heart, lying cold on the ground

Who had the heart, and who had the brain
To shoot my little darling on that cold lonesome plain?

They picked up their rifles and hunted us down
They found us a-loafin' all around town

But I know I'll die as an innocent man

I've been in this prison for seven long years
Each night I see ellen through my bitter tears
I got a letter yesterday, I read it today
The flowers on her grave have all faded away

To go to her grave 'neath that old willow tree

And I found out that it was my loving spouse

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

So many nights like this

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Jon Lucien,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Jon Lucien,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [Swunk]
Jon Lucien,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

A-wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground

A-wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

You know it breaks my heart in two
How beautiful you are
I've seen you in a million dreams
Now you're finally here with me
We will never be apart
I want to hold you forever
That's all I'll ever need

You are my love 
You are my life
My heart and soul
The truest friend I've ever known
You are my world

It hits me so deep inside

You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now

And face in the blankets

The razor in pockets
The drives to work that don't ever drive by

It's a four letter word
And who'd ever thought that
A four letter word
Would be so hard to spell out

On edges of seats

Cuz its not love

Than I'll spend all my time dodging yours I guess
Cause life's lost anatomy is a hole in my heart
A five cent society post part

And at the blink of an eye
We'll get the courts involved
And if you don't like her eyes you just get 'em annulled

Before we go, we all should know that

Carousel's around me and no one here has found me
And I don't think you saw the parts that only are
And I'm leaning on my instincts, guide me to the meaning
Everything you said, filling up my head

Never lose, never lose
Before we go, we all should know that

Well, memories only hurt you, they're taking over
Let me on the inside, I'll be your shoulder

You got my time on the dotted line
But you show up invited and before I sign
And someone say I'm not making mistakes
But please don't be fake

My debut comes today
And my feelings have all run away
With the man that I am but understand
Hey, if I don't keep going it'll just go to show
That I've been beat by an industry I've never seen

This is me on my knees
Singing take it all from me, take it all
Speak to my needs, my needs
Oh, and take it all, oh, just take it all, this is me

So the crowd gets quiet, I start to play
And I think they're buying what I got to say
But to my defiance the music fades
And we all sit silent and I crawl back inside
Because it wasn't supposed to go this bad

This is me on my knees
Singing take it all from me, take it all
Speak to my needs, my needs

Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction

Assuming that she'll get it wrong
Perfect only in her imperfection

But we just don't wanna leave
If we can't dance on the ceiling we'll be dancing in the street
No excuses let the music rock your body right

Jon McLaughlin,"They tore my high school to the ground and
Put a new wing in the east lot
On my old parking spot
It stands reminding me of how
I wish that I could travel back in time
Change my state of mind

So if you're still in your teens listen to me

It's hard to see beyond these walls
Of who (who) and who not to be
Socially
Maybe you're in you're out
But in the end when all your hats are in the air
Nobody's gonna care

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown
So be cool, be hot, be weird
It's just four years

Next time you're walking through your school
Take at who's surrounding you
Or hounding you
Cause it's all just castles in the sand
When your tassel's on the left side of your head
You're never going back

So hope
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the king of the nerds and the queen of the prom get a job
What did you know?
He's a CEO and she answers his phone
So be cool, be hot, be weird
It's just four years

And as for your grades I know they're important
Everyone wants to be a wiz
Cause all of it goes on permanent transcripts
I just don't know where mine is

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on cause every homecoming court moves on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown
So be cool, be hot, be weird oh
So be hot, be wild, you're here oh
Be cool, be hot, be weird

Jon McLaughlin,"I've been around for a little over 20 years. 
And to anyone who needs advice on getting here. 
Don't ask me, the path I took was not exactly by the book, by the book. 
I was too young to know and to dumb to figure out. 
That you can lose yourself in all this traveling around. 
When you reach a point of no return losing touch with lesson learned, lessons learned. 
Let me tell you now where I went wrong. 
Hollywood is just another place I don't belong.

[Chorus]
Let's go to the middle where time stands still. 
Let's get lost in those hills. 
Live a little closer to what is true. 
I'll be me and you be you.

I'm finding out the ways of this world can we overcome with one boy's love for just one girl. 
And the only way to love yourself. 
Is to give your love to someone else, someone else. 
Don't believe in everything you hear. 
Growing up is more than just living through the years.

[Chorus]

I'm disappointed in myself. 
I left you on a shelf that I could never reach. 
I practiced what you'd always preached against. 
But now I'm back in my defense. 
That black and white world we tried to paint is really gray. 
So it took a little while to get this right. 
The guilty and the innocent are always side by side.

[Chorus]",The Middle
Jon McLaughlin,"I'm not a fool
I know all the rules
You can't trick me, get one by me
There's nothing I haven't seen before
How can you be sure you're the only one who's working an angle tonight
So if we're gonna play this game look me in the eye and

[Chorus]
Tell me you're in love I'm the only one
Go on and lie to me with all the things that you say
It's alright
Just give me tonight
Go on and lie to me and I'll believe the things that you say
Show me what you want
Anything I got you can take it, fake it, make it
Whatever you're needing to believe
If we both agree we can't say we didn't see what was coming tonight
So if we're gonna play these parts
Look me in the eye and

I know you're not making sense
I know this is all pretend
But your dishonesty is killing me
So, baby, I'm all in

Jon McLaughlin,"She has the power with every move she makes
To turn my eyes and to turn my fate
To be here, to be here
But I am a liar
The promises I've made have broken down with my broken way but I'll be here, 
I'll be here

And as long as I am
I'm gonna throw my love around

I see all the people with broken hearts
In an unfriendly world who cares who you are?
And it's not fair, they don't care
But you are here for me
I am part of the life you're leading
So I won't move without you

I'm gonna throw my love around

This is not the you I know
This isn't real

You'll do what you will do

[Chorus]
But when the cloud in the sky starts to pour in your life
Its just a storm you're braving
Well don't tell yourself
You can't lean on someone
Cause we all need saving

Sometimes

Say what you will
But the time that we fill
While we are on the Earth
Should not be alone
We were meant to be known
You make me what I'm worth
But I can't keep you from yourself
You'll do what you will do

And I don't know
Why it has to be this way
And I don't know
The cure
But please believe someone else has felt this before

Jon McLaughlin,"Entering a room on an autumn night
I ran across a beautiful sight
From that point on when I was not looking at her I said, nothing else looked quite right
Now I was not about just to let this go
I wasn't gonna leave and not know the way her voice sounded
Against my ears
So I went over to say hello
And I whispered in her ear real slow I said

[Chorus]
The stars moved when you walked in the room
That's why I'm talking to you
My heart won't beat in the groove unless I'm talking to you I know I'm not the only fool with eyes
And you'll get attention from all the other guys
I'm gonna stand here til you realize why I am talking to you

Now I had to take a minute to take her in
I did not know where to begin
Cause I was just moved by the way she dressed and the way her dress hit her skin
Any girl who's met any guy will know that some guys are just for show
So I looked into her eyes and I said this is as true as the truth goes
I'm gonna make sure I let everybody know that

[Chorus]

Let me take a minute to explain myself
Let me say some words that may help
The reason why I've got to be close to you is just that I don't want nobody else
I'm gonna make sure I keep you all to myself

[Chorus]",Why I'm Talking to You
Jon McLaughlin,"I would never, ever let you go
All this fighting's really just a show
That we put on behind doors that
Everyone knows aren't closed

And all these eyes are watching in the dark
Putting black holes in the stars
That we used to think were ours
Until they fell apart
Right now they seem so far

[Chorus]
But all I know is the way you hold my heart
But all that shows is the way we fall apart
To a world I hate, you are the one I love
They'll say what they'll say, but they'll never say enough

I'll sing it more than once
That you are the one I love
And after all of the things we've said and done
You are the one I love

Now there are couples, couples everywhere
Oh why, oh why does everyone care
It's hard to be me and you when all that everyone does is stare
Oh all that they do is stare

[Chorus]

Why can't we hide away
All that I need is your face
To remind me that I feel this way

[Chorus]

And so I hate
You are the one I love

Has faded to lies

And don't make a noise

And those little glances, she gives them out all day

It hurts when I think back
To the first time I saw her eyes

But now she's in another town, probably
Got the other boys running around
And she'll bless them with the same curse

Hey girls, you better hide your men
It's not just her looks and her curls
It's what she does with them

It's a shiny prison cell where time stops

I've tried to walk

Like no one else exists anymore
And I'd talk to you if only I could speak
And I'd dream of you if I could fall asleep

And then I stand up and go talk to you

Here I am sleeping on the floor
We changed just like the leaves
Outside my house
And my phone lay silent by the couch

I remember June
Back when I met you
And your eyes were green
And we were, too

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

I can still see your silhouette
In the white hot sand
And I still feel your ring on my hand
And the clock was always ticking down
Behind that glass
Singing ""love, be good while you last""

But we both knew
What we were getting into
The things we said
Sounded true

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

The distant innocence
We are leaving far behind
Your last words will be burning in my mind
In the winter time

Well summer is over

Felt you getting colder
I knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life

Jon Naples,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It's Colorado rocky mountain high

Jon Naples,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

And bewildered by the world we see

Many problems
We need an understanding heart

Dreams and visions
That I ponder, so clearly now
There before me, figure in darkness
Rage and anger, cold and heartless

Tempting fate, my soul awaits it's crucifixion
I can't take it no more

Disappears into the lights
Waiting on something to make this feeling right
I twist and moan, and turn the other cheek
I wait for my moment to be free
I'm not alone

The night is black it twists and turns 
Inside it's agony
It waits for you, it waits for me, in all its majesty
I can feel it, I can hear it, I can see it
Slowly coming closer to me now
It's breathing, heart is beating, thoughts misleading
Reality has somehow broken down
Slowly slips away, slips into the grave
I don't think I'll ever, ever, ever get away
Somehow save our souls, as the darkness calls,
From beyond these walls
I feel something's going wrong

The dark descends upon this
World of anger, hate and greed
Surrounding you, engulfing me
Now all that we can see
Lying, cheating, children bleeding
Mothers pleading
Will you stop it, will you stop it now
Can you feel it, do you hear it
It's so near, it's coming closer, coming closer now

Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know 
Tell me can we ever really ever get away
Try to save our souls as the dark unfolds
All that's still untold

And as the dark begins to die into another day
And fate is testing once again all we can do is pray
To sweet Jesus, will you lead us, do you hear us
Calling to you, calling to you now
We're praying, contemplating, situations
That can fall before us even know

Tell us what's in store, fall all that stand before

See they prey upon the weak
Just like the snake they creep
Ever so cautiously 
Into your life

Told you lived a life of sin
And if you don't give in
To what they're preaching
It's hell when you die

Then I just slam the door
I can't take anymore
The story's always changing

And I just cannot wait 
Till they come face to face
With the God that 
They're disgracing

Thriving in the end times
Trying hard to steal another life
Looking for a good sign
But they've lost them all I'm sure",End Times
Jon Oliva,"When we were young but never told
How the world could be so cold
As we change from young to old
The night takes us away
The night takes us away

As the day falls to the night
Then we take the stage
Play the game of life
Where everyoneâ??s just trying to succeed

At dawn as the day begins
To weave our way through a world of sin
Temptation only leads to agony

And I can feel your tired, starving 
Try to break through

Feel the weight of the world upon you
Thereâ??s nothing but Evil beside you
Watch out 'cause theyâ??re coming to get you
Another day just trying to get through

Live, love at times we grieve
But thereâ??s so much more that we really need
Seems all there is are sketchy prophecies

Scratch, claw just to survive
Have to fight our way through this world of lies
Just so we can feed our families

And I can feel your tired, starving
Try to break through

Feel the weight of the world upon you

Jon Oliva,"You, looking out of holes
Tell me what you see
Just pain and agony

So this is holy war
The people who live free
Are now your enemy
And I want to know 
Is it worth it all?

[Chorus]
There's so much waiting out there
Open your eyes and you will see
Or you'll just keep on hanging
Like puppets on a string

You are the living dead
Your life's been thrown away
You're counting down the days

So you're answering his call
To live your life this way
As nothing but his slave
And I want to know 
Is it worth it all?

There's so much waiting out there
Open your eyes and you will see
Or you'll just keep on hanging",Holes
Jon Oliva,"I don't see things quite the same
Pictures inside my brain
Twisted visions, vague and scattered

I show you pictures only you and I can see

I'm just paving the way

And smile as I watch you fall

I just don't know right from wrong
Or where these memories belong
They are specters, shadow dancing
I tell it all black and white
I use no colors to hide
All the things that are grey and blackened


Can you feel me deeply breathing in your dreams where
I show you pictures only you and I can see

Now you may choose your own way
Be sure you never betray
The pictured lives we have ordered

I show you pictures only you and I can see

All through history
He has been watching over the lands

Are as plain as the lines on his hands

Through the eyes of the King

Still sits upon his throne
Guarded by walls of stone
Through the years he surely has grieved
Look at what the world has done
We have poisoned everyone
Now he sees things he just canâ??t believe

Whatâ??s this I see

He looks for reason why
Pain fills his eyes

Sunburned auburn air the California dream

To some old Motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's moving through my mind (moving through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again

Said write about the things you know about

Just stick around and you'll find out before too long

So I pulled out my guitar and I put my pen to paper
Started working on the groove

Would believe

When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself IÂ´ll find her
But I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill

My baby needs an angel

SheÂ´ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didn't even try

I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band 
And somewhere on the highway

To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon

Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way sheÂ´s ever known

But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray sheÂ´s ride a dolphin
But sheÂ´s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark

They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee

Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl

I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder

You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children

Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago

Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning

And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing

And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying

For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender

And could you hear me calling out your name
Well, I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping

And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

Jon Randall,"Some say it's destiny
Whether triumph or tragedy
But I believe we cast our nets out on the sea
And nothing we gather
Comes for free

I would have paid down through the years
A price beyond rubies beyond tears
To keep you safe with me
But your suspicion and your fear
Your vow to let nobody near was your trinity
Such a tragedy

I drew the best hand you'd ever hold
Then cashed my winnings in long ago
Settled for silver how could I know
You were waiting with the gold

I could have caused your heart to yield
But I was only a disturbance in the field
Of your dreams
And I will never see you cry
You won't be with me when I die
A waste of you and me
A tragedy

We took the wrong train to
Kingdom come now
No more damage
Can be done baby
It's just what the world don't need
It's another stinkin' tragedy

That's how the story goes
Our chapter's coming to a close
We are history
But I will always think of you
Every day until my days are through
You made me believe
In tragedy",Can't Hurt Anymore
Jon Randall,"He said ""Oh my love. Oh my Antonia 
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin 
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria 
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""

She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her 
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win 
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever 
I'll never see her in this world again

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember 
All off the days of my life 

I curse the ambition that took me far from her 
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are"" 

I can still hear him. he calls to me only 
What once was begotten shall come to no end 
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely 
My soul just to hold him in this world again 

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife

Jon Randall,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin' on the front porch coolin' in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played

Waitin' for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian

Just across the line
And a little southeast of Meridian

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her, ?Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""

He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standin' there with her
When the telegram come for Lillian

Now he's lyin' somewhere
About a million miles from Meridian

She said, ?There's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound""

""And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down""

Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard

Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in

Across a red dirt line
Just a little south east of Meridian

Yes, she tried hard to love him
But it never did take
Just another way for the heart to break
So she learned [Incomprehensible]

One thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got 'em
You keep on fallin' 'cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end at least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had five kids
Could-a been the whiskey, could-a been the pills
Could-a been the dream she was tryin' to kill

But there won't be a mention in the new little world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian

Who never got any farther
Across the line than Meridian

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Mountain of Regret
Jon Randall,"I meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar

Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel        
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel

There was still that line that you would never cross

With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me

There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the songs of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung

I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell

Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

I don't know
Exactly what I was looking for
But once I held you I knew
Nobody else could ever do

In the heat of love
Decisions we make may not all be real
But one thing I know for sure
Is that I love you so

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake

Wanna make something real
Show me how you feel, baby

Life is sweet, knowing you found
What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Que cuando no estás me siento diferente

Cuando estás en mis brazos
Quiero amarrarte a mí
Y no entiendo
Cómo puedes estar, estar sin mí
No, no, no
Yo quiero estar contigo
No sé por qué, dime por qué

Ya, ya no puedo más
Ya me es imposible soportar
Otro día más sin verte
Ven, dame una razón
Si es algo que no tiene solución
Es otro día más sin verte

Es otro día más

Nada que hacer
Palabras tal vez que puedan detenerte
¿Qué tengo que decirte
Para qué no te vayas?
No te separes más de mí
No
Hazme el favor y dime
Dime qué puedo hacer, mi amor
No, no, no
Te tengo y no tengo nada
Estoy tan cansado de estar separados

Jon Secada,"I love you
It'll never be the same
Not this way again
With someone new

But someone new
Will just have to do
'Cause you never loved me at all
You told me yourself

Why'd you stay with me, baby?
You'd let me take the chance
Left me making plans

For nobody, nobody
You said you were waiting
For your heart to fall in love
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

But they say, time heals all wounds
I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Heal my broken heart

'Cause I loved you and I was true
You know I've been carrying a failure's cross
I did everything to win your heart
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

And they say, time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart

And what of the nights
When you looked in my eyes
And you told me, you loved me?

You made me feel in my heart
It was real not a spark
But a flame burning inside
Who can put out this fire inside?

Time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal

Time heals all wounds
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Time heals all wounds

You say we're running out of things to say

They don't belong

There's no way to work it out
When there's always something
We can turn this love around but
There's always something

Stop and think and realize
We got something here that's really good
And maybe all we gotta do
Is believe in us the way we should
Without questions, without doubts
Live and learn babe that's what love's about.

There's always something
We can turn this love around but

There's always something

Always agonizing, never compromising
Always finding something wrong

There's been something wrong.

Jon Secada,"Feel your skin, taste your lips
The love we made
Seems like yesterday
Walk with me

It hurt so much to let you go
Come to me, I let you slip away
With so much to say
(So much)

I speak to the wind
Whisper your name in the dark
Waiting to find the answers
Hoping to wash away your tears

I speak to the wind
Closing my eyes for a moment
Imagine your face in the morning light
Girl, you light up my life
(You light up my life)

Fell so deep, did so wrong
Turn back time
And be where you belong
'Cause I need you now

Make it right somehow
To hold you close
Live out the dream
(Live out the dream)

I speak to the wind
Whisper your name in the dark
Waiting to find the answers
Hoping to wash away your tears

I speak to the wind
Closing my eyes for a moment
Imagine your face in the morning light

Jon Secada,"How can 'meant to be' turn into a memory
When just yesterday we said love was here to stay
How does love so strong go from right to wrong
We don't have to share this fate
There's another road to take, it's not too late

There's no sunshine anymore
Now that you walked out my door
And I can't go on if we can't be together

There's no sunshine, just the rain
Till you take me back again
But if I have to, I'll wait for you forever
Oh, I'll wait for forever

I lay in the dark wondering where you are
Can't help imagining, baby, what you're doing
Tell me what you need and I will give it gladly
Just to see your face again, face again
Just to know it's not the end, oh, it's not the end

There's no sunshine anymore
Now that you walked out my door
And I can't go on if we can't be together

There's no sunshine, just the rain
Till you take me back again
But if I have to I'll wait for you forever
Oh, I'll wait for forever

Baby, I know you told me
The seasons have to change
Oh, but you know they always
Will come back again

But baby, if that's what it takes
For our love to grow
Ooh, I will wait for you, baby, yes I will
Just don't leave me here alone

There's no sunshine anymore
Now that you walked out my door
And I can't go on if we can't be together

I will stand down in the rain

When my word has been you for so long
How can I lie to my heart and go on pretending
Nothing has changed
I'm alone again without understanding
Why all my life waiting for the day

That a dream would come true just to slip away
The sun won't shine again and time could never mend
A heart that's been loved and then
Broken in two
Has nothing to live for 'cause nothing will do

Jon Secada,"It was only last night
That I noticed something wasn't right
But then she looked into my eyes
And left me wondering and feeling like such a fool, this can't be true

Why is this happening to me?
I really want you like you can't believe
But I guess I'm gonna play the game
So before you go there's something that you should've known

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye

I keep on trying to forget
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
I wouldn't know how to explain
'Cause there's no excuse for loving you there's so much I could lose

'Cause there's no easy way
It's not my place to make you wanna say
And I know you want me to
Are you ready now, it's up to you, what do you wanna do?

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye Yeah

So now that we both understand
What's really going on
Make no mistake, girl, yeah
Say what you really want, what you really want

Don't be afraid of what you feel
'Cause I'll be here for you
But you gotta let him know, it's time that he should go
If you want me girl, you gotta show me

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye

That you'll be my love

We like tryin' new things
But when it comes to making love
My girl and I don't swing, no, no

All night long
We take our time we do it right
We don't need nobody else besides ourselves
All we need
Is our favorite privacy

For daylight
There's a star that shines
For the world in you, the one
Who wants to believe?

In a new day
What do you say?
There's no room no need to compromise
There's an open ended dream ready and waiting on the inside

When the heart is strong
And the morning comes and your spirits free
To take on tomorrow
Do you see yourself, beyond that place
Where you know you started from 
Bring on the sun
Bring on the sun

Take a lifetime to remember
Take a minute to forget
Like the eyes of a child rejoices, love lifts them away

In the presence
Of our innocence
Was the truth or who do you follow
Where's the shelter when you feel
Scared and alone in your sorrow

Jon Secada,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

They say I'll get a couple weeks of riding high,
Then a sudden change of heart goodbye
But I'll take my chances

Yea I'll take my chances
Think the payoff's worth the risk 
But if the dice don't roll my way
and a broken heart is all I get

I'll take my chances and go 
'long with my heart and my soul 
retrace this old dead end road
And find what I've been chasin'
Somewhere between now and then
I might make the wrong turn again
Girl I'm a big boy you know 
I'll take my chances and go

The way you smile and shake your head 
I don't buy what everybody says 
yea I like my chances 
but then again on the other hand 
there's something 'bout your eyes that say you can 
do a man some damage 
I'll take the gamble you won't leave me high and dry, 
but if I feel your leaving comin' you won't have to say goodbye

I'll take my chances and go 
'long with my heart and my soul 
retrace this old dead end road 
and find what I've been chasin' 
Somewhere between now and then 
I might make the wrong turn again

I'll take my chances and go

Hope they turn up what we like 
and if it turns out they don't 
I'll take my chances and go

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Jonah Jones,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Jonas Brothers,"She's the kinda girl that you see in the movies
Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me
Down by the shore first weekend of the summer
Gotta take chance and just ask for her number
I wish I had a song on MTV
Cause in crowded room I'd be the only one she`d see
She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break
'Nother minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's that were I wanna be
'Nother minute everything just feels so new
That's just six minutes with you
Six minutes

She's looking at her watch while the dj is spinnin'
This could be the end or its just the beginnin'
She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better
Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never
I wish that I was on the radio
I'd sing her favorite song she'd be front row at every show
This party's lame and now I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy (that guy, that guy, that guy)

Yeah, time is passing by
I'm losing my mind
I need
One, two, three, four, five, six minutes with you

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break

I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a flux capacitor
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen yeah
He said

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
And girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in the time machine

I can't forget it
I won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you

We had fun under the sun
And when winter came she'd be my angel
We were so in love
Then she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, yeah

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

I don't know what hurts worse baby
Seeing you with him or being alone
On my own
I know he doesn't love you baby
Not like I did
Oh, what's the point
You're not listening anyway

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it

There's a whale in the pool with my mother

Jonas Brothers,"If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Every thing's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

How long will I be waiting
To be with you again
Gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Every thing's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head high
And it's all because you're by my side

When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Every thing's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that its forever
I just gotta let you know
I never want to let you go

'Cause when you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me

When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise

The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said ""yes""

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said ""yes""

Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As a thunder starts to crash

Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her

From the lines that now are leading
To the truth I need to hear

I can't stop, even if I tried
I lay down my pride, I can't walk away

Throw 'em in your backseat

You might
Fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you on the finish line

Driving all your friends
At a speed they cannot follow
Soon you will be on your own

Fall off this track sometimes

And I gave

Sometimes to fly you gotta dare to try without permission

Mais rien ne me changera

Parti de rien je n'oublie pas d'où je viens

Est ce qu'on pose une bombe au lieu de se comprendre
Impossible d'aimer sans être soi-même
Atteindre son âme c'est atteindre ses rêves

Je n'ai pas perdu de temps, ni d'amis d'autrefois
Désole d'être franc ou un peu maladroit

Comme on cherche à montrer

could you listen, and remember that i love you
only, because i told you, because i told you so.

if you told me you lied
but i stayed true and tried
would you believe me then?

and if your beauty was gone
but my love lingered on
would you believe me then?

could you listen and remember that i love you
only,

let this one thing remain,

",Because I Told You So
Jonatha Brooke,"It's as if we're tracing some familiar faultline
Running down the coast from you to me
Dark potential just beneath the surface,
All the worlds colliding in the tragedy

Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter
Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, like a lamb to slaughter

Silence has become our only currency
You pay me and I'll be sure to pay you back
But step lightly 'til you've crossed the jagged border
'Cause the earth may shift beneath you, pull the rug out,
All your history keeping track

Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter
Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, like a lamb to slaughter

I'll reel in my addictions in the face of your distress
Aches and pains all shelved and put aside
I'll jump to my conclusions, but I'll leap to your defense
And I'll wish I were the brave one as I breathe another lie

'Cause it runs in the family, it's coursing through our veins
It lingers and gets caught in our hearts
Running in the family, it's a little like insane
The trimmings and the trappings of the artist and the art

I'd die here alone, only daughter

You're not listening to me

But you're not far from the tree

And you say, you're OK, but you live your life like it's over
And you say, you're OK, but you live your life like it's over

In your dreams, all your passion is like liquid fire
You trail your fingers find the spark
And you see your face reflected in the silver spirals,
But then it burns down in the dark.

And you say, you're OK, but you live your life like it's over
And you say, you're OK, but you live your life like it's over

And all the things you ever tried to tell me,
Somehow don't apply to you

That the good guy, the early bird, the one who tries, the one who tries Again

Now we're holding our breath, and I'm trying to hold on to you

What was it that you wanted that I didn't understand
The Boomerang of expectation's back to bite the hand

I give my love to you
And you, you walk away too soon

You could feel along my faults and defenses at last
Someday you'll dismantle the colored wires
Yellow, green or red, is it love or desire

You can face me now or you can shrug and act surprised
Either way someday you'll see yourself reflected in my eyes

And you, so brave, sing ""heroes"" when you're all alone
You balk at what you should have known,
You've got nothing to lose, but me

A king's castle in the sea

She waited in the garden outside

The guests inside were dressed for the water
But the princess remained outside alone
And the king who had called her 
His precious flower

Would not grant her a room of her own
She was young and frightened
By the glittering wealth, and she wondered
If she'd be allowed to stay...

But she slipped herself into the sea and
Swimming, naked, all the crystal,
Lovely, dancing waves were hers and
Whispered, ""I am here, yes, I am always""

The king was angered by such indecency
He sent his soldiers to pull her out
Her foot met something sharp on the ocean floor
But still she did not want to leave

She saw the king, and she saw with him 
That the island was not her home
She could not live her life
Like the rest of his court-

Swimming, naked, all the crystal,

Knock on your door but I wouldn’t take no for a ride

Two years in the forest, I can’t see the trees if you hide

And if you forgot, could I make you remember
The piece of yourself that you gave long ago?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze
There at the still point, that’s where I’ll be

We would find hindsight at the edge of the world
Love at the end of indifference
We’d be the lovers that time could forget
Distance would forge us, make us stronger in the end

And if I forgot, could you make me remember
The piece of myself that I left winding by?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze

At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire

A day by your side, two years in the forest
A decade of hopeful, a terrible leap

And nothing is not enough
And more than anything

I wish you well I wish you might
I wish you were alone tonight 
I wish that I could leave the past behind
For once, I wish that love would last

Cause nothing is not enough
And more than anything 
I wish you loveâ?¦.

Jonatha Brooke,"There never was a world I couldn't sing into place until now
There never was a love that I could not replace until now
Winter was hard, we came out with our hearts frozen through
Now we're holding our breath, and I'm trying to hold on to you 
What was it that you wanted that I didn't understand
The boomerang of expectation's back to bite the hand 
I give my love to you
And you, you walk away too soon 
A landmine doesn't take much to trigger the blast
Feel along my faults and defenses at last
Someday you'll dismantle the colored wires
Yellow, green or red, is it love or desire 
You can face me now or you can shrug and act surprised
Either way someday you'll see yourself reflected in my eyes 
I give my love to you
And you, so brave, sing ""Heroes"" when you're all alone
You balk at what you should have known
You've got nothing to lose, but me 
You lose me, love me, choose me 
There never was a world I couldn't sing into place until now
There never was a love that I could not replace until now 
I, I give my love to you
And you, you walk away too soon

Jonatha Brooke,"You’re a beautiful girl, what’s the matter?
They gave you the world, and you shattered
It’s such a cliché, you don’t even see it
You’re the talk of the town, and it’s no secret

Everybody said they’d never seen a face like yours
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
I don’t want to hold you back no more

Beautiful girl, but you’ve changed now
To see you like this, it’s just such a shame now

Everybody said they’d never seen a face like yours before
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
I don’t want to hold you back no more

I used to be the one that you’d believe
Now you’re happy listening to anyone but me
And I’m shattered
They gave you the world, but it didn’t matter

I have never seen a face as beautiful as yours, for sure
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
So I’m not gonna hold you back no more

You’re a beautiful girl

But look what you do to yourself, what you do to your friends
So beautiful but beauty couldn’t buy you love

Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

Jonathan Butler,"I met the smiling face of love
She's in my mind always
Through the hero she put into
My life
She kisses all my days

The only one I knew
I kissed the burning lips of lust
It's all I knew to do

This is my love
This is my love
How I wished for her
Good fortune
I tried so hard to see
I listened to the night time breeze
But she is quiet as can be

In all the searching we do
To find love's gentle being
If we open more than just our eyes
We might know what
We're seeing

And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Jonathan Butler,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

I had a scone and a large house blend 
And then a little conversation with my squirrel and chipmunk friends 
I said I'm sick and tired of winter 
And I wish that it was spring 
And then a little fellow named Robin Redbreast 
Began to sing 

And he sang

Oh oh child, now's the time for all the people to get together 
Outside 

'Cause it's the first of May, first of May

Or at least your favorite lay 
The water's not cold baby dip in your big toe 
Maybe I'll see you in flagrante delicto 
Grass below you, sky above 
Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called fucking outside 

I thanked him for the information 
I cried a little when he flew away 
I watched an episode of The People's Court 
And I tried to plan my day 
I called up my old lady 
She wasn't home so I called my girl 
I asked her if she'd like to join me as I 
Entertain the world 

And I said 
Oh oh child, I'll bring a blanket and I promise I will brush the ants off

We were walking in the midday sun 
We met all kinds of people and we 
We fucked everyone 
We fucked a lady who sells ice cream 
We fucked a man with a tan Shar Pei 
Everyone who needed fucking well they 
They got fucked today

Oh oh child, you'll feel the warmth of the love when I stick it to you

Jonathan David Helser,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",It Is Good
Jonathan Davis,"You think you're smart
You're not

That you want me to

You got to go
Come take it all

[Chorus]
The jury is coming
Coming to tear me apart
All this bitching and moaning
Come on it's on
I'm trapped in this world
Lonely and fading
Heartbroke and waiting
For you to come.
We are stuck in this world
That's nothing for me
For me

So much you've got
That you've got passion
It seems to me
That you're not needed
Come on

It's killing me

You got to go
Come take it all

Kiss the golden leaves that you found in the sea

In the windy sunshine where the gulls fly for miles
We were one to meet them and exchange windy smiles
I will not speak a word, so let us stay for a while

So, will you stay with me tonight?
And tomorrow we'll have another day to spend
Get up early, walk, and kick a stone along
Whoa, my baby, it's been so long

You sang a song that was not yours to lend
I gave you a song of mine, one without an end

Stand naked in the dark
Here comes the sun, pull down the curtain

Sometimes laughter is somehow murdered
Shattered glass a thousand ways

Playin' little backyard games

And they love her until she complains

But then again, her youth has ended
She's walking where she used to crawl
Cryin' now before their laughter

Tell me the words you hear that may be kind;
Make it as long as the day's work before us;
Tell me the tune to teach the people just in time.
You'll never know how hard I've tried to find you;
I traveled here, and I ended up out there;
The devil has tried to sing a song of evil,
But he'll never know the kind of musci people share.

Song begins, we all are willing;
Let me hear his children everywhere.",Give Us a Song
Jonathan Edwards,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain
I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show

Tell me have you seen her
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her

Feast your eyes realize this one
That the police are just people with guns
I mean people with funds and guns given the power of blood
To lick-a-shot in a di street and get your people to run — son
And when a cop dies, we all mortified
But when a cop kills he don’t need no alibi
I’m not sayin’ that they should be flawless
I’m telling you the world is lawless
Because we got young knuckleheads power tripping with they tools
And who they serving and protecting? Brother not you…
Not true? Why you think dem call dem babylon?
Cause them just agents of the system
Twist one up get your fist up in the air

I wonder do they include all the police murders

Heaven help the man who makes the other man fight
Heaven help the man who fears the other man because
He got a tan or he black or he white
Heaven help the mamma who just lost her baby
By they guns and the justice that was there for safety
And heaven knows just why they had to take his life
And people are angry and people want answers
He wasn’t a nuisance he wasn’t a gangster
They want justice in these streets but there seems to be no justice for police and so

Heaven help the man who makes another man kill
Help the rioters who’s going crazy

Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

Jonathan Kreisberg,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Jonathan Kreisberg,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Jonathan Long,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

Pick up your heart and
Carry it to healing hands
There is no scar, no pain
He won't understand
Those broken dreams you've carried this far
Need his touch to mend
Pick up your heart and
Carry it to healing hands

What brought you here to this time, to the place
Where your own strength has found its end
And the load that you bear is too heavy to carry
Come bring it all to Him

Jonathan Pierce,"A single heart
Groaning for its own creation
Then gave itself to suffer in our place
A living sacrifice of one
Would be the price for all

Enough for every nation

Enough for all our shame
Enough for all the darkness in our land

Heaven changed the world forever
And no heart will ever be the same
One hope was born to save us
And one maker lives to make us stronger

Pouring out itself to heaven
Can bridge the gap to reach eternity

Jonathan Pierce,"[Chorus]
To be a Christian is to bear another's load
To carry what they hold
When they can't walk another day
To be a Christian is holding out a hand
To help another stand
When everyone has turned away
To be a Christian (is giving love away)

They sat there all alone
Their mother almost gone
Their hope was passing, passing with the time
Should I turn and walk away
Or hold their hand and simply say
""I may not know your name, but I can find
In my heart to share your pain
And in my prayers to speak your name
You're not alone...""

Repeat [Chorus]

It isn't always understood
That through our worst, God is good
But when we act with love
It says so much more
There is something said of grace
When it's written on a face
That can touch a heart it's never touched before
For to truly be like Christ
It's not a sacrifice

(To be a Christian)
He gave His life
To help another stand
When everyone has turned away
To be a Christian is giving love away

Wishing doesn't make the heart stop from hurting
And hoping doesn't stop someone from crying
But mercy falls so free
To those who will believe
Just take another look at me

Repeat [Chorus] to end",To Be a Christian
Jonathan Pierce,"I never knew such a freedom
Of letting go of my will to control
But in letting go
I'm learning to heal again

'Cause I know what it's like
To live with a covered heart
Not letting anyone in it
(Not anyone)

And life never
Promised me a perfect plan
Because I know
With you my heart will have a home

All the time in the world
All the words ever said
When it all comes down
We can make it together

All the joys and the pains
All the love and our strengths
When it all comes down
We can make it together

For all the tears I cried
That went up to heaven
Now maybe they were not in vain
So when it all comes down
You know it, we can make it together

Now, my friend, let me help you
Here's my hand and I'll carry you
Until you have wings to fly
Wings to fly again

So lean on me
And I'll be your strength
When you're weak
Until you find your way again
(There is no end)

And life never
Promised you a perfect plan
But together our hearts
Will have a home

All the time in the world
All the words ever said
When it all comes down
We can make it together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Jonathan Rayson,"I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble
The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're going to do next
You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message comes through

And it says to you. . .

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid I might break it

Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions
The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message shoots through --

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

There is no Eden or
Heavenly gates
That you're gonna make it to one day
But all of the answers you seek
Can be found
In the dreams that you dream on the way",Part of the Plan

You've called me when the moon had a viel of light
Before I went from you into the night
I came

Do you remember?
That you
For one more kiss
Beneath the kind star's light

I hear you calling me
And oh the weary gladness in your voice
That warmth that's made my longing heart rejoice
You spoke

Do you remember?
All my heart
Still hears that kiss
And music of your voice

I can hear you calling me
Though years have stretched their weary years between
And over your grave the grass has now grown green
I stand

Do you remember?

I'm still hearing your voice
Through all the years between

Bless me with my young heart's desire,
And on Sunday, when at church, I saw
This girl in the Bethany Hand Bell Choir

She rings 'G' and she rings 'A'
And I can't wait to here her play
They don't trust those notes to anyone else

She's the girl that I've been dreaming of
So let me tell ya something 'bout that church,
There ain't no better place to fall in love.

Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light

Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain

 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,

Jonathan Segel,"I don't know why I am attracted to you
It's not just something you do that excites me
You may never know how I secretly feel
Keeping an even keel when you're near me

You're like the flower that lures the bees to the pure honey
Give me the cure, make me realize
You are the universe, I know I'm blessed and I'm cursed
I just want to be first in your eyes

You may never know how I secretly love
The push and the shove of our meeting
Show me the way to get to your heart
Then you can have part of this feeling

I can't say how whenever you're near
Just your presence dear sends me reeling

When I need more, you're the one I wait for
Please open the door and come in
Give me a sign, so I know you will be mine
We will entwine, let's begin

I know the way that I feel about you
So please let me through to explain it
Somewhere inside the dam has burst open wide
Although I had tried to restrain it

You are the wine in the jug
Come on and fill up my heart-mug
We can both chug it up slowly
You sent a dart, it went straight to my heart
Now I'm back at the start of the song

I don't know why I am attracted to you
It's not just something you do that excites me

",Flower That Lures
Jonathan Segel,"Pop hits, like a nursery rhyme
They'll seep into your mind
You'll never leave behind
Pop hits, hear the master's voice
'Cause you don't have a choice
I'll pick out my Rolls Royce

Pop hits, a virus in your ear
The song you long to hear
Will never disappear
Pop hits, hear the machine
Of the futurist regime

Pop hits, music is a steal
And you think it's real
But it's no big deal
Pop hits, will float around your brain
You must hear it again
Or you will go insane

Pop hits, I'm in my underwear
And all you can do is stare
As if I really care
Pop hits, almost as good as sex
Until you hear the next

Pop hits, the beat goes on and on
As if it were a song
That you knew all along
Pop hits, they're plastic and they're fake
But still they make you ache
To be force-fed cake

Pop hits, it's lurid and it's sick
Because it's just a trick
Designed to make you sick
Pop hits, almost as good as sex
Until you hear the next

Jonathan Segel,"A renaissance of drunkenness
A portrait suicide
In a city full of the heat of food and sex
Aren't you happy how you lied?

Every time I turn around
I see another way I should have gone
I see the thing that makes us glad of other people
That makes being together better than being alone

He's locked out of his own head
The sun is ringing loud today
Head's full of shadows and no matter how loud it rings
The sun can't drive them all away

Like the fisherman who never mocked the sea
I came to you and you came to me
But like the fisherman who never learned to swim
I held my breath and jumped right in

On the life boat
To give the rest of your life in exchange
And live for one short minute
With the boldness you have in your dreams

A renaissance of drunkenness
A portrait suicide
In a city full of the heat of food and sex
Aren't you happy how you lied?

Jonathan Segel,"The world is beautiful
And it's so big
I want to see it all
I want to see just how big

I know you feel it too
It's not just me?
Tell me you feel it too
Tell me that you see

'Cause I think I'm losing touch

Please look at me
Tell me who you see
Not the mask upon my face
Tell me who to be

It's just too much for me
I want to leave without a trace
No, I'm not crying
That's just the rain on my face

I think I'm losing touch

",Losing Touch

Always want more, it's never enough
Mean, mean girls, you think it's fun
But in the end you're all alone
Mean, mean girls, think you're cool
Ain't you never heard of the golden rule

Me, I like the nice girls

Mean, mean girls, all the same
Torture your lover like love's a game
Mean, mean girls never cry
Think you're strong but you don't try
Mean, mean girls, you think it's real
Way down deep what do you feel?

Me, I want the nice girl

Mean, mean girls act like a queen
What is it that you think you win?
Mean, mean girls like you've got it made
Like you're a currency you can trade

While all the rest wait behind

",Mexican Divorce
Jonathan Segel,"I'm in a permanent dream state, can't wake up
I feel so good, I hope it never stops
It's a permanent dream state on my mind
Gliding through, I'm flying blind

It's a lucid dream state, everything's true
Frankly, it's scary but I love it too
Permanent dream state, my minds made up
I'm never coming back, I'm never gonna wake up

From the permanent dream state, from my head to my toes
You can call me crazy but I'm the one who knows
The permanent dream state, I'm riding my bike
I can do anything, I can do what I like

Permanent dream state, feels so real
Like everything at once but it's no big deal
Permanent dream state, bottom to top
I feel so good, hope it doesn't stop

",Permanent Dream State
Jonathan Segel,"This airport has two gates, I'm leaving through gate one
You don't want to hear it but it's been a lot of fun
It's really so simple once I figured out what it was
I couldn't be what you wanted and it wasn't just because

It's hard to believe it, love doesn't go away
But our other expectations of our lives will stay
And I never would have guessed it, thought it could be held by force
That our Las Vegas wedding would yield a Mexican divorce

So go back to your boat, I'll get on my plane
And nothing that we do now will ever be the same
And every night I'll wonder, looking at the stars up in the sky
Which you use to steer you and which stand idly by

",World of Suckers
Jonathan Segel,"An empty room, chill in the air
There are a few clues
Showing who isn't there
All of those spots worn out by my stare

Salt crystals from dried tears
Spice my meals
They've been gathered for years
As if everything is just as it appears

I feel like I'm waiting
Limbo never ends
Time is abating, it's dulling my sense
But it doesn't alleviate the suspense

Breathe a cold breath and blow it on out
Waiting for you to come and end this drought
But I'm still without

I can remember the day that you left
Torn from my side we were cleft
So I wait to stop being bereft

Ghosts in my home but nobody's there
There is no sign
There's no mail in the box, not even a card
The phone doesn't ring, there's not even a sound

No one knocks on the door
And I know that it's you
Not coming home
So I'm still alone

Until the end I will show that I care
With my last breath, I know be screaming
""Life isn't fair"", if I have enough air

",Enough Air
Jonathan Segel,"I want your touch, I want your kiss
When I'm without it, it's exactly what I miss
Because I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy too
I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy like me

I want your effort, I want your time
I want everything to be mine
Because I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy like me
I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy too

I want your kiss, I want your touch
I want everything, it's never enough
Because I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy too
I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy like me

I want your heart, I want your mind
I want more than I realistically find
Because I'm greedy, I wish that you were greedy too
I'm greedy but I guess, I'm not greedy like you

",Greedy
Jonathan Segel,"Scattered gems, you held them in your hand
Broken seashells scattered in the sand

Jonathan Segel,"Hey you, outstanding, what's on your mind?
When you ventured out last time, what did you find?
Did you get hurt out there under the watching sun?
So now you'll just stay in and sulk like you're the only one

Every time you try, there's a chance that you'll get hurt
But every time you hurt, you heal
And every time you heal, you scar
Your scars make you who you are, who you are

Hey you, wall flower, don't you want to dance?
We're all out here on the floor, why not take a chance?
Are you embarrassed at what you've become?
How the world shapes you cannot be undone

Every time you try, there's a chance that you'll get hurt
But every time you hurt, you heal
And every time you heal, you scar
Your scars make you who you are, who you are

Just jump into the water, put it into gear
We both know that the only thing that keeps you back is fear
Those marks that you're left with prove where you've been
Why hide them from the world, let them be seen

It was the moment I made a truce
Between the feather and goose
Come back speaking Spanish
I don't mind

Sky water running off the mountain
Sliding through the light of dusty souls
The feel of what our grows asking the beetle
Of the lonely mocking bird
When you're running off with money man
We all knew there would be no return

That was the moment when the breeze
Stashed across the wicked sees
And came back as the ballad of the pines
Sing it with me if your heart is broken
This is the ballad of the pines
Sing it with me if you're filled with joy

For this is the ballad of the pines
Sing it with your best friends sing it to you
The ballad of the pines
They are scared and their like temples sing it to them

Where the stormy weather stays outside
The beaver still chops the pine
Everybody has a lovely time

But hey
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Shouldn't we get started today

But can you swing me back to North Carolina
Let me show you where the red tail flies
The north river slowly winds
Honey suckles on the vine
Follow me down into South Louisiana
Let me show you where the music lies
Swamp music dream dancing wine

The sand was a grayish shade of blue
Spirits of desire

Jones,"When your only friends are hotel rooms
Hands are distant lullabies
If I could turn around I would tonight

These roads never seemed so long
Since your paper heart start beating leaving me suddenly alone
Will daybreak ever come?

Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

I thought you said forever
Over and over
A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion

These thoughts run through my head
Over and over
Complaints of violins become my only friends

August evenings
Bring solemn warnings
To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight

You never know what temporal days may bring
So laugh, love, live free and sing
When life is in discord
Praise ye the lord

Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

Jonezetta,"My thoughts are just something I will not
Be content to sing along
If I'm the one that's making you so all uptight
Then why don't you just go ahead and
Why don't you just go ahead and

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
It's not like you to ask small favors
You can blame me for everything

If I'm the cause of all your sickness and pain
Then I'll bury my face in the olive dirty sheet
This is just what's getting used to, all of such
Why don't you just go ahead and
Why don't you just go ahead and

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
It's not like you to ask small favors
You can blame me for everything

This is my last plan to bury all of your charms
This is my final rush to reach for you

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
It's not like you to ask small favors
You can blame me for everything

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
It's not like you to ask small favors
You can blame me for everything

You can blame me, blame me
You can blame me, blame me",Get Ready (Hot Machete)

You're kept in the dark, been held there too long
Like a stone heart you're dying to live
The beating is gone, you're still holding on

No, I will never give up give up this fight
And, I just have to get up get up and try

I'm standing on the edge of a waterfall
I can see it clearly from above
That I've been holding back for way too long
But nothing's gonna stop me anymore
I'm letting go
Waterfall
I'm letting go
Like a waterfall

Like a kite being tied by a string
Fighting to fly, you're pulled to the ground
Like a burning star no one has seen
No matter how hard try, you're lost in the sky.

No, I will never give up give up this fight
And, I just have to get up get up and try

They're watered, and well fed tonight

There's a new calf a bawlin'

A light snow's a fallin'

And it's been a long hard ride

  

Now, I'm headin' for home

Where I know it's safe and warm

After a long hard ride

  

Way out here tonight

The stars shine so bright

Lord, what a beautiful land

It's no mystery, it's easy to see

This was painted my the Master's hand

  

And when He calls me home

I'll be safe and warm

Joni James,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Joni James,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Joni James,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Joni James,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Joni James,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Joni James,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love
Joni James,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Joni James,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Joni James,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do

Joni James,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie

Joni James,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Joni James,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Joni James,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Joni James,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

What else could I do again

""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away;
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.","All Through the Day, song (from film ""Centennial Summer"")"
Joni James,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.","But Beautiful (used in the film ""The Road To Rio"")"
Joni James,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so

Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Joni James,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Joni James,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,

Joni James,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Joni James,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Joni James,"Why don't you believe me? 
It's you I adore
Forever and ever, can I promise more?
I've told you so often the way that I care
Why don't you believe me?
It just isn't fair

[Chorus:]
Here is a heart that is lonely
Here is a heart you can take
Here is a heart for you only
That you can keep or break

How else can I tell you, what more can I do?
Why don't you believe me?, I love only you

[Chorus]",Why Don't You Believe Me
Joni James,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?",How Are Things in Glocca Morra?
Joni James,"Since your mother cast her spell
Every kiss has left a bruise
You've been raiding too much meaning from existence
Now your head is used and sore
And the forecast is for more
Memories falling, like falling rain
Falling rain

Every view they hold on your's
A piano, out of tune
You're an angel
You're a demon
You're just human
Now your world has turned to trash
Broken windows on the past
Take that child and teach him senseless
Damage the dream, damage the dream
I feel nothing, i feel nothing at all
I feel nothing at all

In this gloomy, haunted place
All the feelings are of shame
All the windows have been broken by the children
So the wind screams up the stairs
Slams the doors and rattles chairs
I wish we weren't conceived in violence
Damage the dream, damage the dream
The magic is broken
The house is in ruins
Your memory's one-sided
The side that you're choosing feels nothing
Feels nothing at all
We feel nothing at all",Lullaby
Joni James,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?

I made you lonesome and blue

And we were in a most romantic mood

Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low

Like the kicker in a julep or two

that you've a heart that never melts.

Joni James,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

And my heart may go dizzy and fall

I would be, caught in the undertow

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Joni James,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

But in my lonely flight,

Joni James,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Joni James,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Joni James,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

'Neath a starry sky

And you can get it if you try

Sighing sigh after sigh

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Joni James,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Joni Janak,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart
Joni Minstrel,"The soldier came knocking upon the Queen's door
He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
The Queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the Queen went on strangely in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on",The Queen and the Soldier
Joni Mitchell,"Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbor wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his sea dreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his sea dreams come to me

Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the gray sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his sea dreams come to me",The Dawntreader
Joni Mitchell,"I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting-

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can they never can

I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind

[Chorus]

I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year-

[Chorus]",I Had a King
Joni Mitchell,"Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea

Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
He tells her
Wait for me

Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again",Marcie
Joni Mitchell,"Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements
That Michael will change with a stick that he found

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael brings you to a park
He sings and its dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you
To keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry

[Chorus]

Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all
But his mountains have called so you never do

[Chorus]",Michael from Mountains
Joni Mitchell,"I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

The cars and buses bustled through the bedlam of the day
I looked through window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades

You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows",Nathan la Franeer
Joni Mitchell,"Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time",Night in the City
Joni Mitchell,"The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbor town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away

Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest

He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam Of a broken promise in the bay

(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)

He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday

(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)

I was at sea then
I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace

(Then came another ""goodbye"" and another ""Please don't go"")

And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace

(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)

I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place

(Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know)

Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer

I don't know

She knows the answer

I don't know

She knows the answer

I don't know",The Pirate of Penance
Joni Mitchell,"Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbors come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue

Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view

Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade through the grain

Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you",Sisotowbell Lane
Joni Mitchell,"Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach Out of cry",Song to a Seagull
Joni Mitchell,"Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all","Both Sides, Now"
Joni Mitchell,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning",Chelsea Morning
Joni Mitchell,"And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

And so once again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star

We have all come
To fear the beating of your drum",The Fiddle and the Drum
Joni Mitchell,"When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me
You studied to portray me
In ice and greens
And old blue jeans
And naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes
That all your work discloses

""Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart,"" that's what you said
You said, ""I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you""

Somewhere in a magazine
I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine
Who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair
I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere
The writing looks like ladies'

""Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart,"" that's what you said
You said, ""I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you""

I gave you all my pretty years
Then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here
While you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying bock this way
Like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say
And changed you with religion

""Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart,"" that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you

I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me
And all their eyes look shady",The Gallery
Joni Mitchell,"Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote ""I love you"" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand",I Don't Know Where I Stand
Joni Mitchell,"Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand",I Think I Understand
Joni Mitchell,"I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to",Roses Blue
Joni Mitchell,"Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

This is one",Songs to Aging Children Come
Joni Mitchell,"I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
You looked so grand wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly
I heard you can! Can you fly
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice

I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in
I heard you did! Pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win

So lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime

I've lost my fire overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired!
Slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down, down, down, down",That Song About the Midway
Joni Mitchell,"Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories

Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback

Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun

Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today

There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him

In a Bleeker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today",Tin Angel
Joni Mitchell,"You could have been more
Than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

While you still have the time
You could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind Is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whiskey bars
No one cares who you really are
You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard
Keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be
A part of the arrangement

You could have been more
Than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some roam trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more",The Arrangement
Joni Mitchell,"Lady called the blue boy, love
She took him home
Made himself an idol, yes
So he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she traveled
To place her flowers
Before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love
To waken in his face
In his face, oh

Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out through the pain
But the statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, ah

Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight
To find her again
He will come a few times more
'Till he finds a lady statue
Standing in a door
In her door, oh",Blue Boy
Joni Mitchell,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him,
Take your time, it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

And go round and round and round
In the circle game",The Circle Game
Joni Mitchell,"He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
I know she keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentance's
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrow's endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what, he'll find",Conversation
Joni Mitchell,"I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their T.V.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free",For Free
Joni Mitchell,"Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with line
Sewing lace on widows' weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leaf are filigree
And her coat's a secondhand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon

Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies 'round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady

Estrella circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon

Trina takes her paints and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon-
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon",Ladies of the Canyon
Joni Mitchell,"When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milktrucks make their morning rounds
In morning, Morgantown

We'll rise up early, with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning, Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning, Morgantown

Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing in
Morning, Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning, Morgantown

But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning, Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

Morning's just the same",Morning Morgantown
Joni Mitchell,"The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can, through
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, let us try

He said, ""You wouldn't like it here
No it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare
I need the wind and I seek the cold""
He reached post the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
Oh make them both confess",The Priest
Joni Mitchell,"It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With your father's gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the F.M. radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother-she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and you went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see, who in the world you might be",Rainy Night House
Joni Mitchell,"Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him",Willy
Joni Mitchell,"Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue
And there is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there're so many sinking
Now you've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go well
I don't think so, but I'm
Gonna take a look around it though Blue
I love you

Blue
Here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me",Blue
Joni Mitchell,"Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of land to see
But I wouldn't stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here.

Oh, but California
California, I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a sunset pig
California, I'm coming home.

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you, California
Oh California, I'm coming home
Oh make me feel good rock'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

So I bought me a ticket
I got on a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, How long can you hang around?
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown
Then I'm going home to California
California, I'm coming home
Oh will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Take me as I am",California
Joni Mitchell,"The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I've got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne

Oh Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
And I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and
Smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil, who
Keeps me in this tourist town

Come on Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
And I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matalla Moon

Come on Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
And I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, but it's
Really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time since I was
Scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen and that
Fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
I'll put on my finest silver (I'll put on some silver)
We'll go to the Mermaid Cafe, have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight",Carey
Joni Mitchell,"Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she'll answer too
Call her green and the winters can not fade her
Call her green for the children who have made her little, green
Be a gypsy dancer

He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter, say, ""her eyes are blue""
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little, green, he's a non-comformer

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the night's when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes and sometimes
There'll be sorrow

Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you're sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed, little green
Have a happy ending

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the night's when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow",Little Green
Joni Mitchell,"My old man he's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true no, my old man
Keeping away my blues

He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, my old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true no, my old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide

Joni Mitchell,"Look out the left the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon,
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors

Oh star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like, all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine

Oh star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like, all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight

I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing, Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,
Ooh, ooh, love is blind

Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again baby

Star bright, star bright
You got the lovin' that I like, all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight",This Flight Tonight
Joni Mitchell,"Come to the dinner gong
The table is laden high
Fat bellies and hungry little ones
Tuck your napkins in
Take your share
Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare

I took my share down by the sea
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide
Seagulls come down
And they squawk at me
Down where the water-skiers glide

Some turn to Jesus
And some turn to heroin
Some turn to rambling round
Looking for a clean sky
And a drinking stream
Some watch the paint peel off
Some watch their kids grow up
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal
American Dream

I took my dream down by the sea
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
And logs and sails
And Shell Oil pails
Dogs and tugs and summertime
Back in the banquet line
Angry young people crying

Who let the greedy in
And who left the needy out
Who made this salty soup
Tell him we're very hungry now
For a sweeter fare
In the cookie I read
""Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare""",Banquet
Joni Mitchell,"Three waitresses all wearing
Black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies
And Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces
Not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get
From too much choice
The thumb and the satchel
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
And you think she knows something
By the second refill
You think she's enlightened
And she totals your bill
You say ""Show me the way
To Barangrill""

Well some say it's in service
They say ""Humble Makes Pure""
You're hoping it's near Folly
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh
'Cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
And eggs over easy
It's just a trick on you
Her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver
On the way to the till
But he's just a slave
To Barangrill

The guy at the gas pumps
He's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune
Right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields
And this job he's got
And you want to get moving
And you want to stay still
But lost in the moment
Some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask
""Hey, where's Barangrill?""",Barangrill
Joni Mitchell,"The blond in the bleachers
She flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers
You start to fall
She follows you home
But you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries
Calling you
The bands and the roadies
Lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em
It's trouble to keep 'em
'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul
When you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold
You're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child
So sweet and wild
It's youth
It's too good to waste

She tapes her regrets
To the microphone stand
She says ""You can't hold the hand
Of a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Or count on your plans
With a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Compete with the fans
For your rock 'n' roll man
For very long

And the rock 'n' roll man""",Blonde in the Bleachers
Joni Mitchell,"Cold blue steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet fire calling
""You can't deny me
Now you know what you need""
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
Looking for sweet fire
Shadow of Lady Release
""Come with me
I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
Leave someone a letter
You can come now
Or you can come later""

A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy-black cracks of the sky
""Pin-cushion-prick-
Fix this poor bad dreamer!""
""Money"" cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from sweet fire
Black soot of Lady Release
""Come with me
I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you wanna contact somebody first
Does it really matter
If you come now
Or if you come on later?""

Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging
But it's indistinct
Someone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold blue steel and sweet fire
Fall into Lady Release
""Come with me I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you wanna contact somebody first
I mean what does it really matter
You're gonna come now
Or you're gonna come later""",Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Joni Mitchell,"The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy

We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy",Electricity
Joni Mitchell,"I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you
Way up here
Seems like many dim years ago
Since I heard that face to face
So seen you face to face
Though tonight I can feel you here
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet
And he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy
To circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner
The caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women
In Thirties evening gowns
Up the charts
Off to the airport
Your name's in the news
Everything's first class
The lights go down
And it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that

Remember the days when you used to sit
And make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow
To the sound hole and your knee
And now you're seen
On giant screens
And at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you
From the company
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation-well, who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful
With my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here
The critic!
And they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti
Looking at them on my TV set
Oh the power and the glory
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards
And the nails

I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Chilly now
End of summer
No more shiny hot nights
It was just the arbutus rustling
And the bumping of the logs
And the moon swept down black water
Like an empty spotlight",For the Roses
Joni Mitchell,"Lesson in Survival
Spinning out on turns
That gets you tough
Guru books-the Bible
Only a reminder
That you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love
Black road
Double yellow line
Friends and kin
Campers in the kitchen
That's fine sometimes
But I know my needs
My sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing
You and me
Deep kisses
And the sun going down

Maybe it's paranoia
Maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you
Scrutinize me
I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit
That's inside of me
Oh baby I can't seem to make it
With you socially
There's this reef around me
I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm gonna get a boat
And we can row it
If you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying
And the tide rolling in

I went to see a friend tonight
Was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled
Revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright
As a neon light
And I burned out
Right there before him
I told him these things
I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up
In his brow
When you dig down deep
You lose good sleep
And it makes you
Heavy company
I will always love you
Hands alike

Joni Mitchell,"Papa's faith is people
Mama she believes in cleaning
Papa's faith is in people
Mama she's always cleaning
Papa brought home the sugar
Mama taught me the deeper meaning
She don't like my kick pleat skirt
She don't like my eyelids painted green
She don't like me staying up late
In my high-heeled shoes
Living for that rock'n'roll dancing scene
Papa says ""Leave the girl alone, Mother
She's looking like a movie queen""

Mama thinks she spoiled me
Papa knows somehow he set me free
Mama thinks she spoiled me rotten
She blames herself
But papa he blesses me
It's a rough road to travel
Mama let go now
It's always called for me
Sometimes I get that feeling
And I wanna settle
And raise a child up with somebody
I get that strong longing
And I wanna settle
And raise a child up with somebody
But it passes like the summer
I'm a wild seed again
Let the wind carry me",Let the Wind Carry Me
Joni Mitchell,"Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room
Does it have a view?
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey
Who came on to you?
Why do you have to be so jive
O.K. hang up the phone
It hurts
But something survives
Though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me
That I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders
Like a mama lion
I'm not ready to
Change my name again
But you know I'm not after
A piece of your fortune
And your fame
'Cause I tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime

Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just wanna see you again

We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim
I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I would sure like to see you",See You Sometime
Joni Mitchell,"Driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you

I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wild wood flower

Waving for you
Broadcasting tower
Waving for you
And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear
I know you don't like weak women

You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know

I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind
If you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey

Who needs the static
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From ""Breakfast Barney""
To the sign-off prayer

What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm gonna tell you again now
If you're still listening there
If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you

Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sand flies honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
The lines are open",You Turn Me on I'm a Radio
Joni Mitchell,"I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waiting for his car on the hill (Waiting for his car on the hill)
He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now, where in the city can that boy be?
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill

He's a real good talker, I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
But there's still no buzzer
They roll on
And I'm waiting for his car on the hill
It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill",Car on a Hill
Joni Mitchell,"Love came to my door
With a sleeping roll
And a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman
To court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk
For passing change
When something strange happened
Glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made
In People's Park
And went looking for a woman
To court and spark

It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him
And still acting kind
He saw how I worried, sometimes
I worry sometimes

""All the guilty people,"" he said
They've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their christian names
I cleared myself
I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me
I'd complete you

His eyes were the color of the sand
And the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know
The more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A.
City of the fallen angels",Court and Spark
Joni Mitchell,"Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high
And told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
Down to you
Constant stranger
You're a kind person
You're a cold person too
It's down to you

You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh you've found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
You hurry
To the blackness
And the blankets
To lay down an impression
And your loneliness

In the morning there are lovers in the street
They look so high
You brush against a stranger
And you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent
You must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down
Love is gone
Ooh, love is gone
Written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone

Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early
And trouble leaves too slow
Just when you're thinking
You've finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking
At your garden gate
Knocking for you
Constant stranger
You're a brute, you're an angel
You can crawl, you can fly too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you",Down to You
Joni Mitchell,"The way I see it, he said
You just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down

I do my best
And I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors

And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers
And telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way
I'd just walk out those doors

And wander
Down the Champs Elysees
Going cafe to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow

But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song",Free Man in Paris
Joni Mitchell,"Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know
I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble

'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet-taIking-ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'

But not like we love our freedom
Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking

Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good
Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you

Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting

Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom",Help Me
Joni Mitchell,"I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town
With the brakes complaining

I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you lost your heart

I went looking for a cause
Or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat
In this crowded waiting room (Everybody waiting)
Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs
And those wide, wide open stares
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you've lost your heart

What are you going to do now
You've got no one
To give your love too

Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks and these cactus going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety-clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling
Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous lovin's bound to make me
Crazy
I can't find my goodness
I lost my heart
Oh, sour grapes
Because I lost my heart",Just Like This Train
Joni Mitchell,"All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly
Some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something

Photo Beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying, laughing and crying
You know it's the same release

I told you when I met you
I was crazy
Cry for us all, Beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand

I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me?
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to people's parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humor
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away",People's Parties
Joni Mitchell,"He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion
He was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says let me sit down
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame (It's a shame it's a crying shame)
Look at those jokers
Glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey-you've got lots of cash
Bring us round a bottle
And we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking
I was raised on robbery

I'm a pretty good cook
Sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen
I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight, cooking
Trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin'
I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne
He put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest
That son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey
I was raised on robbery

You know you ain't bad looking
I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me, honey
I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going
Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when your loaded
I was raised on robbery",Raised on Robbery
Joni Mitchell,"Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full to mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
""Do you think this can be real?""

Still, I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and glamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church
Like a cop
Like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval

Still, I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said ""Send me somebody
Who's strong, and somewhat sincere""
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love
That don't seem to cease",Same Situation
Joni Mitchell,"Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change
And that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you, keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak
And this spacey

So what are you going to do about it
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion, you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes, too
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu

So why does it come as such a shock?
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human
Is going over too
Well, some are going to knock you
And some'll try to clock you
You know it's really hard
To talk sense to you
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu",Trouble Child
Joni Mitchell,"I am on a lonely road and
I am traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you wanna dance with me baby
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby, well come on

All I really really want is our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me baby
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy
The greed is the unraveling it's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna fun, I wanna shine like the sun
I wanna be the one that you want to see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
I wanna make you feel better, I wanna
Make you feel free
Hm hm hm, hm
Wanna make you feel all free
All I wanna make you feel free",All I Want
Joni Mitchell,"There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaley towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes ""Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try""
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free

There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free",Cactus Tree
Joni Mitchell,"Just before our love got lost you said
I am as constant as a northern star and I said,
Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
And so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you darling and I would
Still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time that you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
And so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said
""Go to him
stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine
You're so bitter
bitter and so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
hmm",A Case of You
Joni Mitchell,"The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe
You laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes
They're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close
Richard, you haven't really changed, I said
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want Nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes
Dark cafes
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings
And fly away
Only a phase, these dark cafe days",The Last Time I Saw Richard
Joni Mitchell,"The firmament of Tinsel Town
Is strung with tungsten stars
Lot's of forty watt successes
He says, ""Where's my own shining hour?""

He's the well kept secret of the underground
He's in debt to the company store
Because his only channeled aspiration
Was getting back that girl he had before

He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme
Describing what it is to lose
He's got some just for laughs, he's got some for love
That mainline to his blues

Some to shed a little light
On you and on me
Some to shed a little light
On a human story

The wars of pride and property
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view

Brave reporters bring the battles home
But tonight inside that box
Just more bang-bang ketchup color to him
Just more Twentieth Century Fox

All because that ghostly girl comes haunting
Just out of reach outside his bed
She kicks the covers off of his sleep
For the clumsy things he said

She commands his head
She tries his sanity
She demands his head
Tonight unknowingly

Vaguely she floats and lacelike
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind
She's nebulous and naked
He wonders where she's been

He grabs at the air because there's nothing there
Her evasiveness stings him now
With long legs, long lonely legs
Bruised from banging into things

One day he was standing just outside her door
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons
She just laughed
She said she heard him knocking
And she teased him for the moon

""Is one the moon, dear clown
Tied to a string for me?""
He tried but he could not get it down
For truth or mystery
He tried but he could not get it down
For love or money
",Love or Money
Joni Mitchell,"I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free.

Now me I play for fortune
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money

Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free.

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their t.v.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony...
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free.",Real Good for Free
Joni Mitchell,"I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh?
Do you really care?
Do you really smile
When you smile?
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try",Woman of Heart and Mind
Joni Mitchell,"Down in the cellar in the Boho zone
I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
Just another hard-time band
With Negro affectations
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
When I was working cheap
It's an old romance-the Boho dance
It hasn't gone to sleep

But even on the scuffle
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
And any eye for detail
Caught a little lace along the seams

And you were in the parking lot
Subterranean by your own design
The virtue of your style inscribed
On your contempt for mine
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
Have a fascination for me

A camera pans the cocktail hour
Behind a blind of potted palms
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
With runs in her nylons

You read those books where luxury
Comes as a guest to take a slave
Books where artists in noble poverty
Go like virgins to the grave
Don't you get sensitive on me
'Cause I know you're just too proud
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Even if good fortune allowed

Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Looking and longing on the sly
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
But you can't get it out of your eyes

Nothing is capsulized in me
On either side of town
The streets were never really mine
Not mine these glamour gowns",The Boho Dance
Joni Mitchell,"Don't interrupt the sorrow

And he chains me with that serpent
To that Ethiopian wall

Anima rising
Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden
Wash and balance me

She's a vengeful little goddess
With an ancient crown to fight

The steeples lean
Winds of change patriarchs
Snug in your bible belt dreams

Like childhood Santa Claus

Since I was seventeen
I've had no one over me

Tall timber down to rock!""

Don't interrupt the sorrow

And I'll pad your purse-

And a mighty, mighty, thirst.""

Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening

From victims of typewriters

The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has wanted grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

Edith in his bed

The wires in the walls are humming
Some song-some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snow blind

Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye

As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town
Yellow schools of taxi fishes

Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows

Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with Raven curls
Beauty parlor blonds with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy
To buy

He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people twenty stories down

Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs

Battalions of paper-minded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives
And paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid

Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath

He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining

The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

We'll find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a Latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns

Wonder makes it easy

With a joyful mask

No color no contrast

Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns",The Hissing of Summer Lawns
Joni Mitchell,"Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading
In a suburban room
I said, ""Take me to the dance""
""Do you want to dance?""
""I love to dance""
And I told him, ""They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance""
""They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance""
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push-up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
""In France they kiss on Main Street""
""Amour, mama, not cheap display""
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling

Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing ""Bye, Bye, Love""
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling",In France They Kiss on Main Street
Joni Mitchell,"Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line",The Jungle Line
Joni Mitchell,"Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away

Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay

Friends have told her not so proud
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling ""Not so loud!""
Lovers in anger Block of Ice
Harder and harder just to be nice
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels

Beauty and madness to be praised
Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says ""A woman must have everything""
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
She says ""A woman must have everything""",Shades of Scarlett Conquering
Joni Mitchell,"Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night

Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight-born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right

Joni Mitchell,"Out on some borderline
Some mark of in between
I lay down golden-in time
And woke up vanishing

Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand

Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching",Sweet Bird
Joni Mitchell,"I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture-post-card-charms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

People will tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm

I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm

A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747's
Over geometric farms
Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms",Amelia
Joni Mitchell,"There's a crow flying
Black and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took a ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How's I ever going to know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue, blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving, diving, diving, diving.
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky

I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky
Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky",Black Crow
Joni Mitchell,"I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I'm down
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I get back to town
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Honey, tell them you've got germs
I hope you'll be thinking of me
Because I'll be thinking of you
While I'm traveling home alone
Tell those girls that you've got Joni
She's coming back home

I've got road maps
From two dozen states
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me
When I get back to town
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
You think they're gone
No, no
They just go underground
Will you still love me
When I get back to L.A. town
You and me, we're like America and Russia
We're always keeping score
We're always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral cafe
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey
And I'll lay down the highway

With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me

Joni Mitchell,"No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel

There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver, no, no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That Coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""

He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway

I looked a Coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes - just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play

No regrets, Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free, free way",Coyote
Joni Mitchell,"Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the gray decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent, staring are her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues",Furry Sings the Blues
Joni Mitchell,"I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shocked love away

There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees

I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

I know, no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way",Hejira
Joni Mitchell,"I met a friend of spirit
He drank and womanized
And I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
""Heart and humor and humility""
He said ""Will lighten up your heavy load""
I left him for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beach town
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh, radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn, turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads",Refuge of the Roads
Joni Mitchell,"I went to Staten Island.
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, ""Have children!""
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want right now
Is, find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by",Song for Sharon
Joni Mitchell,"A strange boy is weaving
A course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard
Through midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child
Needing love and understanding

What a strange, strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
Couldn't bring him to maturity

He keeps referring back to school days
And clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient
Well I failed
""Grow up!"" I cried
And as, the smoke was clearing he said
""Give me one good reason why!""

What a strange, strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side

What a strange, strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

A thousand glass eyes were staring
In a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring
Under crisp white sheets of curfew

We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules",A Strange Boy
Joni Mitchell,"I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old juke box
And he says:
""Snakes along the railroad tracks.""
He says, ""Eagles in jet trails""
He says, ""Coils around feathers and talons on scales 
Gravel under the belly plates""
He says, ""Wind in the Wings""
He says, ""Big bird dragging its tail in the dust 
Snake kite flying on a string.""

I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, ""Your serpent cannot be denied.""
Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind
And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are!

You're a coward against the altitude
You're a coward against the flesh
Coward, caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!
Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward, slinking down the hall
to another restless night
As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
the home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality
Of restless multiplicity
(Oh say can you see)

Restless for streets and honky tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country-safety-and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt locked tenements
Behind my bolt locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity
What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys-these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose
There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take
Or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless life style
I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin
The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman
Scales to feathers
You and I
Eagles in the sky
You and I
Snakes in the grass
You and I
Crawl and fly
You and I",Don Juan's Reckless Daughter
Joni Mitchell,"It's a long, long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down someplace shady
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Good time Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints, all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on

In shoes full of tropic sand

On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

La, la
African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the reline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland",Dreamland
Joni Mitchell,"I'll try to keep myself open up to you
That's a promise that I made to love
When it was new
""Just like Jericho"" I said
""Let these walls come tumbling down""
I said it like I finally found the way
To keep the good feelings alive
I said it like it was something to strive for

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
And approve your self expression
I need that, too
I need your confidence, baby
And the gift of your extra time
In turn I'll give you mine
Sweet darling, it's a rich exchange
It seems to me
It's a warm arrangement!

Anyone will tell you
Just how hard it is to make and keep a friend
Maybe they'll short sell you
Or maybe it's you
Judas, in the end
When you just can no longer pretend
That you're getting what you need
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
It gets easier and easier to do
Just like Jericho
Let these walls come tumbling down now
Let them fall right on the ground
Let all these dogs go running free
The wild and the gentle dogs
Kenneled in me",Jericho
Joni Mitchell,"Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you
I don't know
Loving without trusting
You get, frostbite and sunstroke
I wish I felt nothing!
You pimp, laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat
Your old off night back street

It's been stinger to stinger, darling
It's been heart to heart
You still keep me from finishing
Any new love I start
Now she's moved in with you
She's keeping your house neat
And your sheets sweet
And I'm your off night back street

I can feel your fingers
Feeling my face
There are some lines you put there
And some you erase
Maybe I'm just dramatizing
I don't care
It's home, it can be heaven
When we play fair
But these sentimental journeys
Late at night
High in some back room you're calling me
To be your off night back street

You give me such pleasure
You bring me such pain
Who left her long black hair
In our bathtub drain?",Off Night Back Street
Joni Mitchell,"Marlena under Foster Grants
She's undercover from the dawns advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained
Miami sky
It's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington 

Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty
In her ballrooms heads of state
In her bedrooms rented girls
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty 

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington 

Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream
She has awake
Checked into Miami Royal
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington 
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on",Otis and Marlena
Joni Mitchell,"A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby
You see that patch of city lights
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to
Cotton Avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to 
Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues
On Cotton Avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you
On Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just so no place special",Overture-Cotton Avenue
Joni Mitchell,"It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer ...
It's stifling in here ...
I've got to get some air ...
I'm going outside to get some air

Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down!
They're such sky oriented people--
Geared to changing weather ...
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time

When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war ...
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war

But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed--on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams

I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking

(Where crows gaze--vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes--
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain ...
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness?
How came they to this dream?
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend?
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
there comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
to the beach to toss it up
to the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me--
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces.)

The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more!
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights
And spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you!",Paprika Plains
Joni Mitchell,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through all these highs and lows
I heard there was no sickness
And no toil or danger
Just mercy and plenty
Where peaceful waters flow
Where peaceful waters flow

Come all you fair and tender school girls
Be careful now--when you court young men
They are like the stars
On a summer morning
They sparkle up the night
And they're gone again
Daybreak, gone again

If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor
What a killing crime this love can be
I would have locked up my heart
In a golden sheath of armor
And kept its crazy beating
Under strictest secrecy
High security

I wish I had the wings
Of Noah's pretty little white dove
So I could fly this raging river
To reach the one I love
But I have no wings
And the water is so wide
We'll have to row a little harder
It's just in dreams we fly
In my dreams we fly!",The Silky Veils of Ardor
Joni Mitchell,"There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot!
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keyloids
From the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""
I stole that from Willy the Shake!
You know, ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be""
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!

Is your silence that golden?
Are you comfortable in it?
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison?
Are you gagged by your ribbons?
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
Come and spend some on me,
Shut me up and talk to me!
I'm always talking!
Chicken squawking!
Please talk to me",Talk to Me

It caught me--by surprise
Mutts of the planet
And shook me down for alibis
I'm waiting
For the keeper to release me
Debating this sentence
Biding my time
In memories
Of old friends of mine 

In daydreams of Birdland
I see my soul on fire
Burning up the bandstand
Next time
I'll be bigger!
I'll be better than ever!
I'll be happily attached
To my cold hard cash!
But now Manhattan holds me
To a chair in the sky
With the bird in my ears
And boats in my eyes
Going by

There are things I wish I'd done
Some friends I'm gonna miss
Beautiful lovers
I never got the chance to kiss

Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living
Processions of missing
Lovers and friends
Fade in and they fade out again
In these daydreams of rebirth
I see myself in style
Raking in what I'm worth
Next time
I'll be bigger!
I'll be better than ever!
I'll be resurrected royal!
I'll be rich as standard oil!
