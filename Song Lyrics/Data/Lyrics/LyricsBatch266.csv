Leonard Cohen,"I’m slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

It’s not because I’m old
It’s not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said

I’m lacing up my shoe
But I don’t want to run
I’ll get here when I do
Don’t need no starting gun

It’s not because I’m old
And it’s not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood

I always liked it slow:
I never liked it fast
With you it’s got to go:
With me it’s got to last

It’s not because I’m old
It’s not because I’m dead
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said

All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night

I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes

I always liked it slow:
I never liked it fast
With you it’s got to go:
With me it’s got to last

It’s not because I’m old
It’s not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said

I’m slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

So baby let me go
You’re wanted back in town
In case they want to know
I’m just trying to slow it down",Slow
Leonard Cohen,"I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
Luck was all we ever had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
You looked so good I didn't care
What side you’re fighting for

It wasn't all that easy
When you up and walked away
But I’ll save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burden’s heavy
As you wheel it through the night
Some people say it’s empty
But that don’t mean it’s light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
You’re tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
You always said we’re equal
So let me march with you
Just an extra in the sequel
To the old red white and blue

Baby don’t ignore me
We were smokers, we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge
I see the ghost of culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salute some new conclusion
That all of us have missed

I cried for you this morning
And I’ll cry for you again
But I’m not in charge of sorrow
So please don’t ask me when
There may be wine and roses
And magnums of champagne
But we’ll never know
We'll never, ever be that drunk again

Okay
The party’s over
But I've landed on my feet
And I’m standing here on this corner
Where there used to be a street

The party’s over
But I've landed on my feet
I'll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

So let's drink to when its over
And let's drink to when we met
I'll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street",A Street
Leonard Cohen,"You got me singing
Even tho’ the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had

You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I’d like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho’ it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn

You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon’s in the mail

You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I’d like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho’ it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song",You Got Me Singing
Leonard Cohen,"They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line there moving through the station?
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I don't like your fashion business mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I'd really like to live beside you, baby

And I thank you for those items that you sent me
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I am guided

Ah remember me, I used to live for music
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin","First We Take Manhattan [Live at The Complex, Los Angeles, 18th April 1"
Leonard Cohen,"If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
That’s how it would be
My life would seem to me
If I didn’t have your love
To make it real

If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world
Without a trace
Oh well that’s where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn’t lift the veil
And see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day
Had nothing to reveal
That’s how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn’t have your love
To make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt
Could ever heal
Well that’s how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn’t have your love
To make it real",If I Didn't Have Your Love
Leonard Cohen,"Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it’s much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it’s not the truth today

I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it’s not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it’s much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it’s not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace",It Seemed the Better Way
Leonard Cohen,"I’m leaving the table
I’m out of the game
I don’t know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you, oh no, no
It’s a crying shame
If I ever loved you
If I knew your name

You don’t need a lawyer
I’m not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I’m not taking aim
I don’t need a lover, no, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don’t need a lover
So blow out the flame

There’s nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We’re cutting the cord
We’re spending the treasure, oh no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored

I don’t need a reason
For what I became
I’ve got these excuses
They’re tired and they’re lame
I don’t need a pardon, no no, no no, no
There’s no one left to blame
I’m leaving the table
I’m out of the game
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game",Leaving the Table
Leonard Cohen,"I knew that it was wrong
I didn’t have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out

I said I best be moving on
You said, we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young it 
Took my breath away

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don’t was saying do

Let’s keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

Now I’m living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I’m old and I’ve had to settle
On a different point of view

I was fighting with temptation
But I didn’t want to win
A man like me don’t like to see
Temptation caving in

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don’t was saying do

Let’s keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too",On the Level
Leonard Cohen,"Steer your way through the ruins
Of the altar and the mall
Steer your way through the fables
Of creation and the fall
Steer your way past the palaces
That rise above the rot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your heart past the truth
You believed in yesterday
Such as fundamental goodness
And the wisdom of the way
Steer your heart, precious heart
Past the women whom you bought
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your path through the pain
That is far more real than you
That smashed the cosmic model
That blinded every view
And please don’t make me go there
Tho’ there be a god or not
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa which you’ve probably forgot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way, o my heart
Tho’ I have no right to ask
To the one who was never
Never equal to the task
Who knows he’s been convicted
Who knows he will be shot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa which you gradually forgot

Month by month
Day by day

Leonard Cohen,"I’m traveling light
It’s au revoir
My once so bright
My fallen star

I’m running late
They’ll close the bar
I used to play
One mean guitar

I guess I’m just
Somebody who
Has given up
On the me and you
I’m not alone
I’ve met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do

Goodnight goodnight
My fallen star
I guess you’re right
You always are

I know you’re right
About the blues
You live some life
You’d never choose

I’m just a fool
A dreamer who
Forgot to dream
Of the me and you
I'm not alone
I’ve met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do

Traveling light
It’s au revoir
My once so bright
My fallen star

I’m running late
They’ll close the bar
I used to play

Somebody who
Has given up
On the me and you
I’m not alone
I’ve met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do

But if the road
Leads back to you
Must I forget
The things I knew
When I was friends
With one or two

We used to do
I'm traveling light",Traveling Light
Leonard Cohen,"I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don’t get high with you

I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I’m angry and I’m tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

They’re dancing in the street, it’s Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we’re free
I’m sorry for the ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I haven’t said a word since you’ve been gone
That any liar couldn’t say as well
I just can’t believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my aerial

The fields are crying out, it’s Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we’re free
I’m sorry for the ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything

And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I’m angry and I’m tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine",Treaty
Leonard Cohen,"If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

Leonard Feather,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Leonard Feather,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Leonard Feather,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love
Leonard Feather,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Leonard Fisher,"I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Baby, remember my name!

Baby, look at me
And tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet.
Give me time,
I'll make you forget the rest.
I got more in me,
And you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hand
Don't you know who I am?

Remember my name. Fame!
I'm gonna live forever

People will see me and cry. Fame!

Remember, remember, remember, remember,
Remember, remember, remember, remember.

Baby, hold me tight
Cause you can make it right.
You can shoot me straight to the top

Baby, I'll be tough
Too much is not enough, no
I can ride your heart 'till it breaks.
Ooh, I got what it takes.",Fame
Leonard Garr,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Leonard Gaskin,"Don't even go to a movie show

Leonard Gaskin,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.

Leonard Hochman,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Leonard Nimoy,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin'
Cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind
Leonard Nimoy,"You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby, I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralysed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, 
Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now 
'Cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam some 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Oh Ruby
For God's sake turn around","Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town"

Le printemps est revenu avec toi
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, c'est déjà la fin de ma longue nuit
Sunny, à nouveau pour moi le soleil luit
J'ai eu des mauvais jours dans le vent et la pluie
J'avais si peur que tu m'oublies
Mais tu m'aimes toujours, mon amour

Sunny, tu m'as ramené tant de soleil
Sunny, le ciel est si bleu quand je m'éveille
Je me vois déjà aux vacances d'été
Les beaux jours durent toute l'année
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, merci pour toutes les choses que je te dois
Sunny, pour tout le bonheur d'être avec toi
Oh merci pour le regard que tu poses sur moi
Et pour les images que j'y vois
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Oh ! Sunny, ce matin encore c'était l'hiver
Sunny, depuis que tu es là le ciel est plus clair
Il y a du soleil dans les rues sur les toits
Le printemps est là avec toi
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour",Sunny
Leonard Shaw,"Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's every dream I dream
All night long

Never heard him say a single word of love
Don't know his fate or his soul
'Cause he only speaks to me in dreams I've dreamed
All night long

When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no

I don't wanna love that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so warm?

Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long

Leonardo,"Mano, você é meu sangue, mais que um amigo
Me dizia coisas que até hoje eu sigo
E será pra sempre um pedaço de mim
Mano, cantar ao seu lado me deixou orgulhoso
Agradeço a Deus, foi maravilhoso
E sempre sonhei com imagens assim
Mano, eu me lembro do nosso pequeno universo
O primeiro acorde, os primeiros versos
Parei pra pensar hoje no camarim 

Juntos, nós fomos a voz de uma linda canção
Digo a você lá no fundo do meu coração
Nossa missão foi cantar e levar alegria
Mano, você é a letra, eu sou a melodia 

Mano, você sempre foi mais que um companheiro
Nas horas difíceis foi tão verdadeiro
Me deu a certeza que no fim vou vencer
Você me dizia que depois da poeira
Um lindo horizonte vai aparecer
Mano, as suas palavras me fizeram de aço
E hoje eu sei que em tudo que eu faço
Eu posso cantar e contar com você",Mano
Leonardo,"Quem é que garante 
Que não vou chorar 
Se eu ficar sozinho 
Não vou segurar 

Lágrimas que rolam 
Não voltam pra trás

É uma mágoa a mais 

Já perdi um grande amor 
E não quero a mesma dor

Tudo que eu tinha pra chorar 

Eu preciso é de um beijo 
Quero colo 
Quero tanto esse teu cheiro 
Quero colo",Quero Colo
Leonardo,"Eu sou assim
Nunca soube recitar poesias
Não sei palavras de amor
Nem sou sedutor, não sei fingir, nem poderia 

Eu não tenho ouro nem prata
Mas o meu maior tesouro eu te dei
Só quero o teu amor e mais nada
Você precisa entender, é que eu não sei dizer 

Só sei que eu te amo demais
Nas noites sozinhos é o teu nome que eu chamo
Baby, eu te amo demais 
Eu só sei dizer te amo, te amo 

Como eu te amo
Te amo demais 

Palavras valem menos que um olhar
Meu coração é quem vai te explicar
Da cabeça aos pés, eu vou te beijar
Como sábio na arte de amar 

Não sei mentir para conquistar uma mulher
Daria tudo nesse mundo só pra ter você
O destino seja o que Deus quiser
Você precisa entender, é que eu não sei dizer",Te Amo Demais

Leonardo,"Se não fosse amor demais
Eu dava um tempo e ia embora
Tô perdendo a minha paz
Jogando a vida fora
Mas eu sei que não consigo viver sem você
Se não fosse essa paixão
Buscava outra companhia
Se eu vivesse de ilusão
Era uma festa todo dia
Mas eu sei que não tem jeito
Eu não vou te esquecer
Mas brigar com quem se ama
Não apaga a velha chama
O que fica é a tristeza
Quando bate uma saudade
Não precisa muito tempo
E cai na realidade
E na hora do desejo
É só teu corpo que eu vejo
Se invento uma ilusão
É tua boca que eu beijo
E assim que eu vou bater
De frente com a verdade
Você pra mim é um perigo
Mas nesse amor tô fechado contigo
Agente acaba ouvindo o coração
E se ele quer quem é que pode dizer não
Você pra mim é um castigo
Mas faz amor e um carinho que eu fico
Que é que eu posso fazer

Leonardo,"Quero ouvir da sua boca
Coisas que seus olhos querem me esconder palavras 
Que contem segredos pro meu coração
Quebrar, quebrar esse silêncio que machuca a gente
E mande embora do meu peito essa solidão 
Não se feche desse jeito 
O amor é feito de compreender 
Quem sabe uma palavra mude tudo de lugar 
Não deixe atrás do teu sorriso o ressentimento 
Palavras que não te deixa me perdoar
Uma palavra só e eu tão-só chorando 
Duas palavras só te amo, te amo
Uma palavra só e eu tão-só chorando 
Duas palavras só te amo, te amo
Te amo, te amo",Uma Palavra Só
Leonardo,"Era um sol do meio-dia
Tava um calor arretado
Quando ela foi chegando
E já sentado do meu lado 

Nunca vi coisa mais linda
Que mulher, que avião
Tomando água de coco
Era uma tentação 

Virava o coco na boca
Dava uma lambidinha
Derramava água na roupa
E ficava molhadinha 

Naquele jeito gostoso
Atiçava o meu desejo
Deu vontade de beber
Água de coco no seu beijo 

Ela segurava o coco
E alisava o canudinho
Pra me deixar no sufoco
Dava um tapinha no coco
Só pra deixar doidinho 

Ela balançava o coco
E também meu coração
Eu ali naquela sede
Parecendo um coco verde
Que ela passava a mão",Agua de Coco
Leonardo,"Juro que já fiz de tudo
Pra me convencer
Que eu posso me aceitar sozinho
Longe de você
E nessa briga de orgulho
O coração me diz
Como pode alguém
Com tanto amor
Deixar de ser feliz 

Já tentei buscar
Uma paixão
Um novo sentimento
Mais você não sai
Nenhum segundo
Do meu pensamento
É locura tentar te esquecer
Querer ficar sozinho
Tanto tempo 

Vai levar a vida inteira
Pra te esquecer
E mesmo assim eu sei
Que ainda vou sofrer
Buscando em cada rosto
Ver o teu sorriso 

Vai bater uma saudade
Quando eu me lembrar
Do seu jeito gostoso
E doce de me amar
De tanto te querer
Vou perder o juízo
Não te quero, mas,
Eu sei que te preciso",Longe de Você
Leonardo,"O vazio desta casa
É maior que o oceano
Tenho todo amor do mundo
Mas não tenho quem eu amo 

Passo o tempo olhando as ruas
E essa minha dor não some
Me faz falta o teu sorriso solidão tem o seu nome
Tem o seu nome 

O meu pensamento a todo momento
Vai te buscar sem te encontrar
A saudade entra em meu quarto e deita
Vem pra me amar em seu lugar
E a paixão vem dizer
Que eu não vou esquecer
O seu jeito de amar
Tudo lembra você, um me olha te vê
Basta só procurar no meu olhar",Maior Amor Do Mundo
Leonardo,"Tentei me proibir
De pensar em você
Mas como desistir
Do que eu mais quero ter
Não deu certo uma vez
E nunca mais vai dar
Depois do que me fez
Não era pra eu te amar
Ah, meu amor
Que raiva que me dá

Madrugada é solidão
Parece estar vindo alguém
Virou alucinação
Olho e não vejo ninguém
Quanto mais eu tento te odiar
Mais te quero bem

Dizem que amar é sofrer
Isso nunca vai mudar
Quero algo pra beber
Pra acabar de arrebentar
Acho que nasci pra te querer
E me machucar

Não deu certo uma vez

Leonardo,"Quando estou contigo cresce a esperança
Faz alimentar o amor em minha alma
E sem pensar você roubou o meu sentimento
O que será de mim se não te tenho?
Se não estás comigo, me escapa o ar, coração vazio
Estando em teus braços, somente ao teu lado sinto que respiro
Não há nada que mudar, não há nada que dizer
Se não estás comigo não quero mais nada, me sinto vazio
E quando te amo, sinto que a teu lado perco os sentidos
Tem muito que inventar, não há nada que fingir

E levo esse sorriso porque já chorei demais
Hoje me sinto mais forte, mais feliz quem sabe
Só levo a certeza de que muito pouco sei
Eu nada sei

Conhecer as manhas e as manhãs
O sabor das massas e das maçãs

É preciso amor pra poder pulsar
É preciso paz pra poder sorrir
É preciso a chuva para florir

Penso que cumprir a vida seja simplesmente
Compreender a marcha ir tocando em frente
Como um velho boiadeiro
Levando a boiada eu vou tocando os dias
Pela longa estrada eu vou, estrada eu sou

Conhecer as manhas e as manhãs
O sabor das massas e das maçãs

É preciso amor pra poder pulsar
É preciso paz pra poder sorrir
É preciso a chuva para florir

Todo mundo ama um dia, todo mundo chora
Um dia a gente chega no outro vai embora

Cada um de nós compõe a sua história
Cada ser em si carrega o dom de ser capaz
De ser feliz

Conhecer as manhas e as manhãs
O sabor das massas e das maçãs

É preciso amor pra poder pulsar
É preciso paz pra poder sorrir
É preciso a chuva para florir

Ando devagar porque já tive pressa

Me miro al pasar
Yo le sonrei

Me pidio que no
Que otra vez será
Que otra vez será
Que otra vez será

Sé que nunca mas.
Como olvidar su pelo
Como olvidar su aroma
Si aun navega en mis labios
El sabor de su boca
Cada piba que pase
Con un libro en la mano
Me traera su nombre
Como en aquel verano
Eeeh eeeh eeeh...
Fuiste mia un verano
Solamente un verano
Yo no olvido la playa,
Ni aquel viejo café,
Ni aquel pajaro herido
Que entiviaste en tus manos
Ni tu voz ni tus pasos
Se alejaran de mi
Que otra vez será
Que otra vez será
Que otra vez será
Tierno amanecer
Se que nunca mas.
Eeeh eeeh eeeh...",Fuiste Mia un Verano
Leonardo Favio,"Hoy corte un flor 
Y llovía y llovía
Esperando a mi amor
Y llovía y llovía.

Presurosa la gente, 
pasaba, corría
Y desierta quedo
La ciudad pues llovía.

Yo me puse a pensar 
tantas cosas bonitas
Como el día en la playa
Cuando te conocía.

Como jugaba el viento
Con tu pelo de niña
Ay que suerte, que suerte
Tu mirada y la mía.

Cuando llegue mi amor 
le diré tantas cosas ,
o quizas simplemente 
le regale una rosa.

Por que yo corte una flor
Y llovía y llovía
Esperando mi amor
Y llovía y llovía.

Que me alegra tu canto
Que me alegre tu risa
Que se alegre en silencio
Tu mirada y la mía.

Nos iremos charlando por las calles vacías
Nos iremos besando por las calles vacias.

Y sabrán que te quiero
Esas calle vacías
Y yo te ire contando 
tantas cosas bonitas.

Leonardo Favio,"Quiero aprender de memoria
con mi boca, tu cuerpo muchacha de abril
y recorrer tus entrañas
en busca del hijo que no ha de venir;

Quiero partir con mi canto
tu cuerpo de niña y hundirme a vivir
nada me importa la gente
que opina y se mete, no me han de entender.

Como explicar que te quiero
que me sonrio y muero al verte pasar
como explicar que te amo
si no fuiste mía, ni lo serás jamás.
          
Como explicar que me duele
hasta el aire que juega en tu pelo y tu andar
viva si escuchas mí canto
sabrás que es el llanto que lloro por vos
poco me importa la gente 
que opina y se mete, no comprenderán. 

Ay si pudiera en tu pecho
tener el sosiego y encontrar la paz,
y acariciando tu pelo
encontrar el sueño que no puedo hallar;
ay si tu boca me diera
callada la forma del amor de amar
encontraría un motivo
para seguir viviendo, de poder luchar.

Leonardo Favio,"Para saber 
Como es la soledad 
Tendrás que ver 
Que ya a tu lado no está 

Que nunca más 
Con él podrás charlar 
Sobre lo que es el bien 
Sobre lo que es el mal 

La soledad es un amigo 
Que no está 
Que son palabras 
Que no ha de llegar igual 
Este es un sueño 
Son luces entorno a vos 
Y te das cuenta 
Que él ya nunca ha de morir 
Nunca ha de morir

Como muere la flor 
Así has de ver 
Que también muere la paz 
Pero esa paz 
Revivirá en su voz

Es un amigo que no está 
Es tu palabra 
Que no ha de llegar igual

Leonardo Favio,"Y te dejaste amar por mi, sin preguntar
Si yo mañana iba a seguir, o iba a dejarte
Y las palabras fueron mil y mil los dias,
Y mil las veces, te los di, en caricias

Y comence a darte, de a poco, todas mis ganas,
Y comence a volverme loco, cuando no estabas
Y descubri que algo paso, muy dentro mio,
Y se mojo mi corazon, con un rocio

Y me enredaste en tu informal filosofia,
Y me mostraste un mundo, que no conocia
Y me volviste a la niñez y a la inocencia,
Y a aquellos años puros de mi adolescencia

Y sin querer me hiciste hacer todo de nuevo,
Y solo en vos, me pude ver simple y sincero,
Y me enseñaste a ver el sol en la avenida,
Y hasta intente hacerme querer por tus amigas

Y si mañana ya no estoy, o me voy lejos,
O no siento lo mismo que hoy, o me hago viejo

Leonardo Gonçalves,"Hoje é domingo de manhã
Hoje o sol não quer brilhar
Tudo é solidão
E elas vêm dizer de madrugada ressurgiu

Não acredito em ilusões
O sol da justiça se apagou
O mundo inteiro viu
Os cravos em suas mãos
O seu corpo a sofrer
Sua morte lá na cruz não consigo entender
E agora este túmulo vazio
Esse anjo a questionar
Porque procuro entre os mortos quem vivo está

E hoje sou livre, pois Ele vive
Ele vive, Ele reina em mim, em mim
Morte e pecado foi derrotado
E eu sou livre, eu sou livre enfim, de mim

Como Jesus ressuscitou
Da morte eterna para luz
Da água renasci
E faz sentido servir
Alguém melhor que eu

E hoje sou livre, pois Ele vive
Ele vive, Ele reina em mim
E os que descansam no Senhor
Quando voltar despertarão
E em sua carne enfim verão a Deus

Hoje sou livre, pois Ele vive
Ele vive, Ele reina em mim, em mim
Morte e pecado foi derrotado
E eu sou livre, eu sou livre enfim, de mim",Ele Vive
Leonardo Gonçalves,"Hoje eu compreendi
O amor de Deus por mim
Mais uma vez

Por isso eu vou cantar
Minha vida entregar
Guardar suas leis

Sempre que eu compreendo mais o quanto me ama, sinto euforia
Pois eu sei, Deus fala à minha mente
Mas isso causa intensa emoção

Eu cantarei ao Senhor
Um hino de louvor
Eu cantarei ao Senhor
Um hino novo

Hoje eu sei também
Sua graça me sustém
Pelo seu sangue sou livre

Está a preparar
Nova terra, novo lar
Onde a morte não vive

Basta um vislumbre da eternidade e sinto euforia
Mas pra herdar a glória do futuro
Preciso praticar seu reino aqui

Quero entender o sentido
Quero sentir o entendido
Quero viver minha vida em função de um pedido
Que ele transforme minha mente e o meu coração

Eu cantarei ao Senhor
Um hino de louvor
Eu cantarei ao Senhor
Um hino novo",Mente e Coração
Leonardo Gonçalves,"Carros pela cidade
Correndo contra o tempo
Distantes no vazio

E eu anseio
Pela noite ou pelo dia
Dia sublime, tão sublime
E na saudade por alguém que eu ainda não vi
Me imagino correndo pra teus braços, ó Pai

Eu só quero a calmaria de um lugar
Que sopra o vento da paz
Guiando às águas tranquilas
Sou estrangeiro e vou seguindo para o eterno lar
Enquanto eu espero o momento em que vou te encontrar

Quando? Não sei

Estarei no meu lugar, no meu lugar tão sublime

Leonardo's Bride,"To build a fire isn't always easy
In a storm but you can try
Just when I was thinking what's an eskimo to do
Something in the fog says I can find my way with you
The walls are white
The room feels bigger than is
On into the night
The wind will be whistling a tune
Just when I was thinking what's an eskimo to do
Something in the fog says I can find my way with you
Sun in my alaska
Sun in my alaska
Time to go outside
Time to read the writing on the wall
Facing up to this
I kiss the light
Colder than a polar bear this much is true
Just when I was thinking what's an eskimo to do
Something in the fog says I can find my way with you
",Alaska
Leonardo's Bride,"Throw me down your ladder I'll climb up
Searching for a hole in the sky
I was always looking for places to hide
I was down I was done over
You pushed me off the edge of my star
When all I tried to do was grow lillies in my palm
I have turned every stone
I have shaken every tree
Holding on, letting go
I had to push my begging bowl
Where's the truth?
Where's the love?
Where were you?
Now there are sparkles on the pavement
The stars are reaching down for me
It was deep inside my heart in the darkness
I began to see
I have turned every stone
I have shaken every tree
Holding on, letting go
I had to push my begging bowl
Where's the truth?
Where's the love?
Where were you?
",Begging Bowl
Leonardo's Bride,"I lost the bow you tied round my finger
Somewhere on the trail
I threw in my hand for a heart full of holes
I rode through the night thinking of you
And whatever it was
I couldn't pin down or tame
Or lay blame at the feet of.
This is not the end
It's just another scene
Blue gone green
I let you go
Like a balloon at the fairground
I ran after you
Saw all the signs saying give up the ghost
But I know there's more to the picture
I've got a good feeling
",Blue Gone Green
Leonardo's Bride,"Everybody wants to take you home
You sat on your bed and cried
I wrap myself round you
You and your stupid pride.
Ditch the dark angel
Climb up on this pedestal.
Everybody wants to take you home
We stepped across the line
Now pleasure's a crown of thorns
And pain is a valentine.
Sometimes we have to learn
When to let the bridges burn.
Why do you want to be
Where no-one can find you
Nobody knows you
Set all your ghosts free
The house is so haunted
Is this what you wanted ?.
Everybody wants to take you home
You try to live up to that
You feel like you're falling short
Like a washed up acrobat.
Mirror mirror on the wall
Raise your arm against it all.
",Everybody Wants to Take You Home
Leonardo's Bride,"There's a world of trouble on my mind
Tell me everything will work out fine
I'll believe you
They've knocked me to the ground again
Tell me what I'm feeling isn't pain
I'll believe you
I wish I could be sure of more than I am now my friend
I lost my needle in the hay
Tell me I will find it again someday
I'll believe
If love is not my greatest defence
Tell me nothing's ever meant to make much sense
I'll believe you
",I'll Believe You
Leonardo's Bride,"You stop yourself before you start
No-one is allowed inside you
The desert of your heart
The one I want to ride through
Let me come over
If you want to shoot the moon
If you want to sail for the sun
If you want to shake the monkey
Baby, I'm the one
Let me come over
I like how you're holding out
For who I wonder
I like your easy blush
And when you swing your wrecking ball
Down like thunder
Baby I can take the crush
Let me come over
",Let Me Come Over
Leonardo's Bride,"I have one foot on the shore
I have one foot in the sea.
Has no mans dagger here
A point for me ?
When it all comes down to dust
Who will you satisfy ?
He who lives more lives than one
More deaths than one must die.
Oh yeh, I get this feeling
Oh yeh, will it ever leave me
Oh yeh, will it ever leave me alone.
To the centre of the earth
Where the wild darkness grows
To the edges of the universe 
Is there anyone who knows ?
",Oh Yeh
Leonardo's Bride,"Somebody made the wheel
Someone said what's the point
Critics come and critics go
The faithless follow fashion mister
Don't you know
Whatever you've got under your hat
You'll need a whole lot more than that.
This reminds me 
Of all the reasons why I hated school
It seemed so black and white I mean
Every moment had a rule
Maybe that's why I see red
Boy you're such a sleepyhead
I wonder what will ever wake you up
The bells of a thousand firetrucks
I sure hope that one day you wake up
Sleepyhead
Higher higher even higher
Don't stop till my head is way up
In the clouds
I don't feel any different
But you sure seem so much smaller now
The door is always open wide
If you ever want to climb inside.
",Sleepyhead
Leonardo's Bride,"He got a tattoo of her name
He only met her yesterday
Always in a rush that boy
He always reads the last page first
He's always cutting to the chase
Always in a rush that boy
Like a bee
Like a bear in honey
Here he comes 
There he goes again
Don't play hide and seek with him
He never counts to ten
Always in a rush that boy
",That Boy

Puedes actriz de la película del mundo

Levantar el vuelo solo ver el suelo 
Libre para reponerte
Para ser mas fuerte o morder el anzuelo

Libre para darte un baño en el mar

Libre para empezar eso, eso que hay que empezar
Libre para lograrlo o solo dejarlo en un lindo plan

Que quiero estar a tu lado",Confieso
Leonel García,"Mejor, me ausentare por un tiempo
Hasta que sienta que el viento
Dejo de hablarme de ti
Mejor no recordare tu cara
Porque el dolor nunca para
Cuando me acuerdo de ti

Mejor no pregunto a nadie con quién estas
No creo poder soportar una herida mas
Ni una herida mas

Mejor ya no digo tu nombre
Para que nunca pueda alcanzarme el pasado
Y me deje encerrado en la oscuridad
Mejor ya no digo tu nombre
Porque guarda palabras, miradas
Momentos, que viven
Muy dentro de mi soledad
Y no puedo aguantar
Sin ponerme a temblar cuando digo tu nombre

Mejor, ya no recorro la casa
Porque al final siempre pasa
Que me dan ganas de huir
Mejor, ya no me pruebo a mi mismo
Que hago mas grande el abismo
De donde quiero salir

Mejor no pregunto a nadie con quien estas
No creo poder soportar una herida mas ni una herida mas

Mejor ya no digo tu nombre
Para que nunca pueda alcanzarme el pasado
Y me deje encerrado en la oscuridad

Leonel García,"Por qué no te bese en el alma 
Cuando aun podía 
Por qué no te abracé la vida 
Cuando la tenía 
Y yo que no me daba cuenta 
Cuanto te dolía 
Y yo que no sabía 
El daño que me hacia 

Cómo es que nunca me fije 
Que ya no sonreías 
Y que antes de apagar la luz 
Ya nada me decías 
Que aquel amor se te escapo 
Que había llegado el día 
Que ya no me sentías 
Que ya ni te dolía 

Me dedique a perderte 
Y me ausente en momentos 
Que se han ido para siempre 
Me dedique a no verte 
Y me encerré en mi mundo y 
No pudiste detenerme 
Y me aleje mil veces 
Y cuando regrese 
Te había perdido para siempre 
Y quise detenerte 
Entonces descubrí 
Que ya mirabas diferente 
Me dedique a perderte 
Me dedique a perderte 

Por qué no te llene de mí 
Cuando aún había tiempo 
Por qué no pude comprender 
Lo que hasta ahora entiendo 
Que fuiste todo para mí 
Y que yo estaba ciego 
Te deje para luego 
Este maldito ego 

Me dedique a perderte 
Y me ausente en momentos

Leonel García,"Sé que te sorprende verme aquí parado 
Sé que fue muy claro que no iba a volver 
Pero estoy cansado de estar asustado 
Solo con pensar en no volverte a ver 
Mírame un momento tienes que entender 

Tengo que decir que estoy muy lastimada 
Que no será fácil volver a empezar 
Pero siempre he estado muy enamorada 
Que si aún me amas quiero regresar... 
Este tiempo solo me ayudo a pensar 

Que no importa lo que hiciste ayer 
Si te has equivocado 
He estado tan ciego que no te he escuchado 
Pero creo que ahora puedo continuar 
Que no entiendo mi vida sin ti 
Que perdono y olvido 
Que quiero intentarlo si aún no te he perdido 
Hay tantos momentos que quiero salvar 

Sé que dije cosas porque estaba herido 
Y que haberme ido no fue lo mejor 
Puedes ser muy cruel cuando estas confundido 
Cuando te ha cegado un golpe de dolor 
Yo sé que vivir contigo es lo mejor 

Que no importa lo que hiciste ayer 
Si te has equivocado 
He estado tan ciego que no te he escuchado 
Pero creo que ahora puedo continuar 
Que no entiendo mi vida sin ti

No te quiero recordar llorando 
No después de amarnos tanto, mírame

Leonel García,"Quédate un momento así
No mires hacia mi
Que no podré aguantar
Si clavas tu mirada
Que me hiela el cuerpo
Me a pasado antes
Que no puedo hablar

Tal vez pienses que estoy loco
Y es verdad un poco
Tengo que aceptar
Pero si no te explico
Lo que siento dentro
No vas a entender
Cuando me veas llorar

Nunca me sentí tan solo
Como cuando ayer
De pronto lo entendí
Mientras callaba
La vida me dijo a gritos
Que nunca te tuve y nunca te perdí
Y me explicaba que
El amor es una cosa
Que se da de pronto
En forma natural
Lleno de fuego
Si lo fuerzas se marchita
Sin tener principio
Llega a su final.

Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Que si me tocas se quema mi piel
Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Y no te vuelvas si no quieres ver

Que lloro por ti
Que lloro sin ti
Que ya lo entendí
Que no eres para mí
Y lloro

Solo una vez he podido enredarme entre tus brazos
Solo una vez y te llevo en el medio de un millón de sueños
Solo una vez he tocado el paraíso con mis dedos
Y te besé, te besé, te besé

Solo una vez y ya no puedo respirar

Solo una vez y el miedo me quiere matar
No se si volverá a pasar

Y te besé, te besé, te besé
Con toda el alma y la piel yo te besé

Solo una vez y cambiaste lo que significa el tiempo
Ahora un segundo es igual a la medida de extrañarte tanto
Solo una vez y no hallar mas que ese mágico momento

Qué dentro todo este dolor

Es poco lo que te conozco

Perderte sí me da pavor

No me queda más refugio, que la fantasía 
No me queda más que hacer
Que hacerte una poesía

Porque te vi venir y no dudé 
Te vi llegar, y te abracé 
Y puse toda mi pasión para que te quedaras 
Y luego te besé y me arriesgué con la verdad 
Te acaricié y al fin abrí mi corazón 
Para que tú pasaras

Mi amor te di sin condición 
Para que te quedaras

Ahora esperaré algunos días 
Para ver si lo que te di fue suficiente 
No sabes qué terror se siente 
La espera cada madrugada 
Si tú ya no quisieras volver 
Se perdería el sentido del amor por siempre 
No entendería ya este mundo 
Me alejaría de la gente

No me queda más refugio, que la fantasía 
No me queda más que hacer

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Oui nous, on disait les autres on s'en fout c'était bien, c'est si loin

c'est ma mémoire qui revient, 
Des images à réinventer,

Trouverait-on nos corps?
Et dès lors le remords
viendraient nous figer encore

Et plus une seconde
Et tout l'or du monde
Ne retarderaient pas ce départ 
Et ce hall de gare
Me laisse entrevoir 
que la seule issue est d'dire trop tard !

Et alors? Et alors? Et alors?",Et Alors ?

Comme oublié un peu le goût des anciennes victoires

Comme la flamme et le feu ce qui nous réchauffait un peu.

Ton sourire, c’est le mien
Ce matin, c’est le tien.

J’l’ai retrouvé hier à la fontaine où tu passais
Comme esquissé au mieux c’est ton sourire que j’ai croisé
En passante égarée je te croyais désespérée
A Saint-Germain tu sais c’est un cadeau que tu m’as fait.

J’ai oublié, J’ai oublié.
Ton sourire, c’est le mien
Ce matin, c’est le tien.

J'vis sur mars seul sur un fil

Mais j't'épargn'rai les quatres saisons.
Je joue le rôle du martien
Rôle que je  me suis fait mien
Toi tu n'aimes que les terriens
Terre à terre ceux qui t'aiment bien
Terre à terre c'est c'que t'aimes bien. 

Mais si j'te l'demandais
est-ce que tu accepterais ?
De rester sur Mars, oui, pour un mois ou deux
La saison est si belle
Une saison sans querelle
Ma venus viens sur mars 

J'vis pour Mars comme une nature 
J'vis sur Mars j me sens nature
Tout marche bien en cette saison
sans même une confrontation
Je joue le rôle que j'aime bien
Rôle que je me suis fais mien
Toi tu m'aimes si je suis bien 
Terre à terre si tout va bien
Terre la terre que tu sens bien 

Mais si j'te l'demandais
est-ce que tu accepterais ?
De rester sur Mars, oui, pour un mois ou deux
La saison est si belle
Une saison sans querelle
Ma Venus viens sur mars

Bientôt ton anniversaire
Suis-je un cadeau sois sincère
des retards des coups de fil
des coups de fil sans coup de fil
Annulations sans prescription
Et d'illusions en illusions...

Leopold,"Choisir une route
En oubliant ses doutes
Coûte que coûte, c'est cette voie qui vaincra
Choisir une cible
Et se croire invincible
Difficile de tomber dans le mille.

Je n'viendrai pas ce matin, ni demain
Je n'viendrai pas ce matin, ni demain, 
Ne m'attendez pas, ne m'attendez pas, 

Je prends mon manteau
Et je quitte ce bureau
Peu importe je casserai d'autre portes
Comme un réveil en sursaut
Je tourne le dos
A ces années de trop bonne conduite

Je n'viendrai pas ce matin, ni demain

That you be sayin' all along,
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
Till I'm gone.

Leos Mares,"Ah yeah..(ah yeah)..it's real.
Gonna put it down.	all these little crime thangs,
Homeless, the world is crazy bwoy
It's like this

It's the way it is
Heavy out there.. it's heavy.

Was i really such a bad child that i deserved to get hit with boards
And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that i was your creation,
And all i wanted from you all was love, hope, and motivation?

Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back,
Get out my face, kicked me out the house
And wouldn't even let me plead my case.
Now i'm homeless and i'm freezing like the morgue,

The only thing keepin me alive is the lord
Needless to say it's times like this i'd rather be locked up then
Drinkin water out my hands and eatin out of garbage cans
Can i come back home, huh could i?
Son, you're on your own, why should i?

[Chorus]
Things will never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things will never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?

Huh. three years from now, i think i'm gon be straight, (straight)
I put my name on the list for section 8
Tried out for the army but i was flat footed,
Didn't do no harm to me, 'cause i was used to it

If i apply for some work, let's make a bet,
I'll get the nine
'Cause i don't know about the internet
What do you think we need to do to change about this nation?

Need to provide more jobs and better education
Nuclear weapons (puh) should be stopping crimes,
Already got enough to blow the world up
A thousand times

The birds and the bees, deadly disease,
Teenage pregnancies, std's

[Chorus]

A-wuh a wait a minute, i hear sirens
Oh that's the couple down the street
Domestic violence
Either them or the little girl in 306

She's always telling everyone that she gon slice her wrists
I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll probably end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next

My auntie brenda turned her own sister in
For writing bad checks
And save folks try to hit you where it hurts
Knowin' they the biggest hypocrites in the church

We need to give our minds a bath and
Do some scrubbin'
Stop the hate and start the lovin'

The last time that I can remember
You smiling down on me.
And the photographs that I have taken of
You in our kitchen making love,
Inside and I, you in pinned
Smell of your love smoking fingers
Bruise and bleeding all still lingers on
Inside this head of mine
And when I hear your music playing
Again I hear your sad voice saying
You were never satisfied
Oh no, you were never satisfied

Come by if you're downtown
We'll drink and celebrate the moon
And all the things you left behind, oho
I've forgiven you for all that you did
Still all I can do is write these letters that will never get to you, oho

A photo smelling ??? burning
As I rinsed my hair this morning
When I called out, you weren't there
And the diesel truck the neighbor drives
Fools me into thinking you're alive
And coming home to stay
But you were running like a chalkboard scratch
All night long, no turning back up
Get what it's your heart a lie
And so you've left me here in pain and wonder
??? never pushing you like thunder coming from the gods
Oh, it might have saved you from the dark

Cold and hard and shiny
To match the way I feel

Black as coal and thunder
Dark as all my sins

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

You were there
To see me beg and kneel
What kind of man would ask me then
If he could make a deal?
When lovers of the future read these lines
A sound of steel and thunder
Will echo in their minds

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

I took it for a long, long time

And turn to blood

How sharp and clean

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.","Sleigh Ride, for orchestra (or string orchestra)"
Leroy Anderson,"There was a man like you and me, as simple as a man could ever be;
And he was happy as a king, except for one peculiar thing.

He had a clock that worked all right, 
It worked all right, but not exactly quite;
Instead of going ""tick, tock, tick"", 
the crazy clock went ""tock, tick, tock"".

The poor old man just raved and raved, because nobody could say
Why his silly clock behaved that hickory dickory way.
But now a famous man is he, 
He owns a public curiosity;
From far and wide the people flock 
To hear the syncopated clock.

Tick-a-tock, tick-a-tock,
There's a zing in the swing of that clock,
Tock-a-tick, tock-a-tick, 
Don't you think it's a marvelous trick?

Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling,
There's a zong in the bong of that ring,
Ling-a-ting, ling-a-ting, 
Don't you think it's a wonderful thing?

The experts came to hear and see,
But none of them could solve the mystery.
They called Professor Einstein too,
He said ""There's nothing I can do"".

But soon the fickle human race will find another freak to take its place,
And one fine day the man will hock the poor old syncopated clock.","The Syncopated Clock, for orchestra"
Leroy Anderson,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon A Midnight Clear
Leroy Barbour,"I have never been so much
In love before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice, so right

Lovin' you gave me something new
That I've never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed though it's not the
Feeling I had before, oh, it's much much more

Love, I never knew that a touch
Would mean, so much
What a difference and we walk hand in hand
I feel so real

Leroy Glazier,"The day that we wed
You blessed us and said
May heaven bestow you grace
There in that holy place
We shared our first embrace

Our cottage was small but richer than all
The palaces of the king
All day the birds would sing
Our hearts were filled with spring

Padre, padre
What happened to our love's so cruel
Padre, oh padre
In my grief I turn to you

Then he came along
And sang her his song
And won her with honey lies
He of the fiery eyes
Now it's not her that cries

So I will pray
The hours away
And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone

Please tell me how such things can be
Padre, oh padre
Pray for my love and me",Padre

Leroy Glazier,"The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He laid to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich Uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil
Listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like that
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owes me forty bucks",Ballad of Forty Dollars
Leroy Jones,"Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

I'm so lonely I could cry.

She's smiling in her sleep
Watch her dance in the night
There's no worries by her side
She just knows she wants to be a little dancer

Perfect was within your reach
But your mind ran and your heart couldn't keep up
Bottle all of your passion inside

You could rearrange it only
If letting go of fears is what you decide
Can't help but they dream

Leroy Van Dyke,"There was a boy in Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his ma
When she told him that he should go to school
He'd sneak away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn

Well he'd stand and listen carefully then pretty soon he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly
He said, ""Oh my it's do or die I've got to learn that auction cry
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer""

25 dollar 30 now 30 dollar 30 dollar 
30 dollar 30 dollar give me a hollar 30 dollar
who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?
35 dollar 35 35 make it 35 and a 35 make it 35 and a 35 
Who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?

As time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
He practied on and then some night and day
His pappy'd find him behind the barn just a workin up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer

Said his pappy, ""Son we just can't stand a havin' a mediocre man, 
You gotta take that auction usin' our good name.
I'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
You can take your place among the best""

35 dollar 40 now 40 dollar 40 dollar 
40 dollar 40 dollar give me a hollar 40 dollar
Who will bid it at at a 40 dollar bid?
40 dollar 45 45 will you make it 45 give me 45 and a 45
Who will bid it at a 45 dollar bid?

So from that morning he went to school there grew a man who played it cool
He came back home a full fledged auctioneer
And people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer

His fame reached out from shore to shore he had all he could do and more
He had to buy a plane to get around
Now he's the tops in all the land so let's all give that man a hand
He's the best of all the auctioneers

45 dollar 50 now 50 dollar 50 dollar
50 dollar 50 dollar give me a hollar 50 dollar
Who will bid it at a 50 dollar bill?

Water is covering the land
So I throw my cares away

Les,"My baby was born in a bed
With white sheets, machines and heat
Travelled home in a car
To a three room nest, eats and sleeps
Laminate floor to crawl on, t.v.
Talks, starts to walk amongst love and security

Goes to school, learns to read an write
Probably follows a team with his friends
And gets to ride the train
Probably fall in love
Probably get to fly on a plane
Get to work all week and spend what he earns
On the high street

He's got doctors, nurses, fireman, churches
Kindergartens, wedding bells and jet black hurses
Passport, bank card, maybe his own yard
Locks and alarms, trinkets and charms
Maybe a baby in his arms.


My baby was born on his knee, one of poverty's offspring
Can into the world coughing, already full of mama's disease
Went back to a flat with no gas, no cash
Wrapped in a duvet full of cigarette ash
Mama can't get no sleep
Baby never quiet enough to eat

Goes to school, learns to steal and fight
Probably form a team with hs friends
Go steam those trains
Fall in love an never trust nobody again
Gets to work all week
standing in the high street for joe

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

And madly I said: ""I love you.""

Too soon I heard you say:
""This dream is for a day""
That's Porugal and love in April!
And when the showers fell,
Those tears I know so well,
They told me it was spring fooling me.

Then morning brought the rain,
And now my dream is through

But it was just the spring fooling me.

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

I concentrate on you.

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Les Brown,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Les Brown,"The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Happy with my someone new
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

My darling, can't we make up?
Ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love

Les Brown,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Les Brown,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Les Brown,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard
Les Brown,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Les Brown,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Les Brown,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Les Brown,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Les Brown,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

Les Brown,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Les Brown,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Les Brown,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win

Les Brown,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Les Brown,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were

Good night sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow
Tears and parting may make us forlorn

Good night sweetheart, still my love will guide you
Dreams enfold you, in each one I'll hold you

Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

'Till now we have never been told
The old question's answered by one that is new
What is so rare, dear, as you?
 
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care
",So Rare
Les Brown,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",The Song from Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart?)

Les Brown,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Les Brown,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart

Am I with you",Younger Than Springtime

Don't make a sound, it's so dark

What a perfect chance to park
And there's no moon at all

Should we want atmosphere for inspiration, dear

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be

Les Brown,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met

Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends

I have a lovely disposition
That's very strange in me
And life's as sweet as it can be
I've lots of courage and ambition
From every care my mind is free
So I repeat, with your permission
There's been a change in me!
 
Have you heard I married an angel
I'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me

Les Brown,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love
Les Brown,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends

And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love

Les Brown,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Les Brown,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Les Brown,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Les Brown,"While dancin with someone
And longin' for you

Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Youth, he set forth as a leader of sorts.  
Just what
Sorts it is impossible to say at this time.  
But he had
The imaginary support he needed to venture beyond
The small environment he'd come to know as his
Home town.

Friends thought him foolish and felt free to fre-
Quently tell him so.  
Deep down they all felt envy.
Envious that he could muster, where they could not,
The courage that was necessary to embark beyond
The notion that survival was based upon the ability
To rise at seven a.m. five days a week.

He felt joy.  
And well he should.  
He was a ""babe in
The woods"" and a ""kid in a candy store"" all at the same time.  
The world was his oyster and he planned
To shuck it, cover it with Tabasco, and slurp it down
His cake hole all within an ""El Sobrante fortnight"".

Definition of an ""El Sobrante fortnight"" is yet to be determined.  
But reliable sources say the time span is
Somewhere between two weeks and a decade.",El Sobrante Fortnight

Les Crane,"Desiderata.  Desiderata.  Desiderata.
Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender,
Be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others - 
Even the dull and ignorant, they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons - they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter,
For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.


Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career - 
However humble, it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, 
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is.
Many persons strive for high ideals, 
and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself.
Especially do not feign affection, neither be cynical about love.
For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,
It is as perenial as the grass.
Take kindly the council of the years,
Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune,
But do not distress yourself with imaginings - 
Many fears are borne of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.


You are a child of the universe.
No less than the trees and the stars, you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.


Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be.
And whatever your labors and aspirations, 
in the noisy confusion of life,
Keep peace with your soul.
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, 
it is still a beautiful world.
Be careful.  Strive to be happy.",Desiderata

How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Les DeMerle,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Les DeMerle,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Les DeMerle,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

Les Double Six,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

And what's more you got arms.

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And that one is you, no other will do

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Les Elgart,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Les Elgart,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Les Elgart,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night

You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse

Les Elgart,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

At the armory

Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep

Les Enfoirés,"A quoi ça sert l'amour ?
On raconte toujours
Des histoires insensées.
A quoi ça sert d'aimer ?

L'amour ne s'explique pas !
C'est une chose comme ça,
Qui vient on ne sait d'où
Et vous prend tout à coup.

Moi, j'ai entendu dire
Que l'amour fait souffrir,
Que l'amour fait pleurer.
A quoi ça sert d'aimer ?

L'amour ça sert à quoi ?
A nous donner d' la joie
Avec des larmes aux yeux
C'est triste et merveilleux !

Pourtant on dit souvent
Que l'amour est décevant,
Qu'il y en a un sur deux
Qui n'est jamais heureux

Même quand on l'a perdu,
L'amour qu'on a connu
Vous laisse un goût de miel.
L'amour c'est éternel !

Tout ça, c'est très joli,
Mais quand tout est fini,
Il ne vous reste rien
Qu'un immense chagrin

Tout ce qui maintenant
Te semble déchirant,
Demain, sera pour toi
Un souvenir de joie !

En somme, si j'ai compris,
Sans amour dans la vie,
Sans ses joies, ses chagrins,
On a vécu pour rien ?

Mais oui ! Regarde-moi !
A chaque fois j'y crois
Et j'y croirai toujours
Ça sert à ça, l'amour !
Mais toi, t'es le dernier,
Mais toi, t'es le premier !
Avant toi, 'y avait rien,
Avec toi je suis bien !
C'est toi que je voulais,
C'est toi qu'il me fallait !

Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé

Elle était si belle la poupée
Elle que les anges avaient dû oublier
Et si on l'avait un peu regardé
Peut-être que l'hiver ne l'aurait pas brisé

Un pied dans le vide, elle a déménagé
Elle perd son équilibre entre deux larmes salées
Y'a comme un goût acide qui hante ses baisers
Elle dit qu'elle est lucide, non, plus jamais se caser
Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé
Et je lui tends la main à travers la fumée

Elle était si belle la poupée
Elle que les anges avaient oublié
Et si on l'avait un peu regardé

En attendant le retour du soleil
Et si le mien passe l'hiver au chaud
Sache que sur toi je veille

Le genre de femme qui change le plus grand délinquant en gentleman
Une beauté sans pareille,
Tout le monde veut s'en emparer
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau
Hypnotisés, on pouvait tout donner
Elle n'avait qu'à demander, puis aussitôt on démarrait
On cherchait à l'impressionner, à devenir son préféré

Oui, c'est un phénomène qui aime hanter nos rêves
Cette femme était nommée ""Bella la peau dorée""
Les femmes la haïssaient, toutes la jalousaient
Mais les hommes ne pouvaient que l'aimer
Elle n'était pas d'ici, ni facile, ni difficile
Synonyme de ""magnifique"", à ses pieds, que des disciples
Qui devenaient vite indécis, tremblants comme des feuilles
Elle te caressait sans même te toucher
Mais quand je la vois danser le soir
J'aimerais devenir la chaise sur laquelle elle s’assoit
Ou moins que ça, un moins que rien

Le beau temps me dégoute et m'fait grincer les dents
Le bel azur me met en rage
Car le plus grand amour qui m'fut donné sur terr'
Je l'dois au mauvais temps, je l'dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d'un ciel d'orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerr' de Brest, avec des cris d'putois
Allumait ses feux d'artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices

"" Je suis seule et j'ai peur, ouvrez-moi, par pitié
Mon époux vient d'partir faire son dur métier
Pauvre malheureux mercenaire
Contraint d'coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu'il est représentant
D'un' maison de paratonnerres ""

En bénissant le nom de Benjamin Franklin
Je l'ai mise en lieu sûr entre mes bras câlins
Et puis l'amour a fait le reste
Toi qui sèmes des paratonnerr's à foison
Que n'en as-tu planté sur ta propre maison
Erreur on ne peut plus funeste

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle, ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers fair' sécher son mari
En m'donnant rendez-vous les jours d'intempérie
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour j'n'ai plus baissé les yeux
J'ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux aux moindres cumulus
Mais elle n'est pas revenue

Son bonhomm' de mari avait tant fait d'affair's
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu'il était dev'nu millionnaire
Et l'avait emmenée vers des cieux toujours bleus
Des pays imbécil's où jamais il ne pleut
Où l'on ne sait rien du tonnerre

Dieu fass' que ma complainte aille, tambour battant
Lui parler de la pluie, lui parler du gros temps
Auxquels on a t'nu tête ensemble

Les Frères Jacques,"Elle était jeune fille,
Sortait tout droit de son couvent,
Innocente et gentille,
Qui n'avait pas seize ans.
Le jeudi, jour de visite,
Ell' venait chez ma mère,
Et ell' nous chantait la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert.

Un soir de grand orage,
Ell' dût coucher à la maison ;
Or, malgré son jeune âge,
Ell' avait d' l'obstination.
Et, pendant trois heures de suite,
Au milieu des éclairs,
Ell' nous a joué la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert.

On lui donna ma chambre.
Moi, je couchai dans le salon.
Mais je crus bien comprendre
Que ça ne serait pas long.
En effet, ell' revint bien vite,
Pieds nus dans les courants d'air,
Pour me jouer la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert.

Ce fut un beau solfège,
Pizzicati coquins,
Accords, trémolos et arpèges,
Fantaisie à quatre mains.
Mais à l'instant où tout s'agite
Sous l'ardent aiguillon de la chair
Elle, elle fredonnait la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert 
Elle, elle fredonnait la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert.

Je lui dis : "" Gabrielle,
Enfin, comprenez mon émoi,
Il faut être fidèle :
Ce sera Schubert ou moi ! ""
C'est alors que je compris bien vite,
En lisant dans ses yeux pervers,
Qu'elle me réclamait la suite,
La suite du concert.

Six mois après l'orage,
Nous fûm's dans un' situation
Tell ' que le mariage 
Etait la seul' solution...
Mais avec un air insolite,
Au lieu de dire "" oui "" au Maire,
Ell' lui a chanté la Truite,
La Truite de Schubert.

C'est fou ce que nous fîmes,
Contre cette obsession,
On mit Gabrielle au régime,
En lui supprimant le poisson.
Mais, par une journée maudite,
Dans le vent, l'orage et les éclairs,
Ell' mit au monde une Truite,
Qu'ell' baptisa "" Schubert ""
Ell' mit au monde une Truite,
Qu'ell' baptisa "" Schubert ""

(parlé)
A présent je vis seul, tout seul dans ma demeure,
Gabrielle est partie et n'a plus sa raison:
Dans sa chambre au Touquet elle reste des heures
Devant un grand bocal ou frétille un poisson.

(chanté)
Et moi, j'ai dit à Marguerite,
Qui est ma vieille cuisinière:
""Ne me servez plus jamais de Truite
Ca me donne de l'urticaire"".",Le Complexe de la Truite
Les Frères Jacques,"De bon matin me suis levé c'était dimanche
A la carriole j'ai attelé la jument blanche
Pour m'en aller au marché
Dans le chef-lieu du comté
Paraît qu'y avait des généraux à vendre

Mais le soleil écrasait tant la route blanche
La jument s'arrêtait si souvent sous les branches
Que lorsque je fus rendu
On n'm'avait pas attendu
Et tous les généraux étaient vendus

Pourtant là-bas tout au fond du champ de foire
Par un coup d'chance il en restait encore un
Il n'était pas couvert de gloire
Mais avec un peu d'ripolin
Il pouvait faire encore très bien

J'l'ai échangé contre un cageot de pommes pas mûres
Quatre choux-fleurs et une tartine de confiture
Tout ça pour un général
C'était vraiment pas trop mal
Et puis je l'ai chargé dans ma voiture

A la maison on m'a fait des reproches amers
Encore une fois paraît que j'm'étais laissé faire
Un Général dans c't'état
Ça valait beaucoup moins qu'ça
Mais puisque c'était fait tant pis pour moi

Et puis les gosses ont eu peur de sa moustache
Elle était rousse et ça les faisait pleurer
On lui a coupé d'un côté
Mais l'chien s'est mis à aboyer
Alors on a laissé l'autre moitié

Il fichait rien pour pas salir son beau costume
De temps en temps il épluchait quelques légumes
Ou réparait l'escabeau
Ou débouchait l'lavabo
Mais y n'savait même pas jouer du piano

Pourtant certains soirs, certains soirs d'été
Le Général s'asseyait sur la paille
Et les yeux perdus dans l'immensité
Il nous racontait ses batailles

Il nous parlait des Dardanelles
Quand il n'était que Colonel
Et de la campagne d'Orient
Quand il n'était que Commandant
L'épopée napoléonienne
Quand il n'était que Capitaine
Et puis la Guerre de Cent Ans
Quand il n'était que Lieutenant
Les Croisades et Pépin le Bref
Quand il n'était que Sergent-Chef
Et les éléphants d'Annibal
Quand il n'était que Caporal
Les Thermopyles, Léonidas
Quand il n'était que deuxième classe
Et Ramsès II, la première guerre
Quand sa mère était cantinière

Et le Général jusqu'au p'tit matin
Déroulait le fil de son immense histoire
Puis il s'endormait sur sa botte de foin
Et nous sans parler
Nous rêvions de gloire

Il est resté comme ça chez nous
Jusqu'à l'automne
Sans travailler sans trouver la vie monotone
Ça nous a même étonnés
D'apprendre par le curé
Qu'il avait fait deux jumeaux à la bonne

Et puis voilà qu'par un beau matin
De décembre
Il est entré sans même frapper
Dans ma chambre
Il v'nait de lire dans l'journal
Qu'on le nommait Maréchal
Alors il nous quittait c'était fatal

Je l'ai r'conduit en carriole jusqu'à la ville
On m'a rendu mes choux-fleurs
Et mes cageots
Et sans émotion inutile
Sans pleurs et sans se dire un mot
On s'est quittés en vrais héros

A la maison la vie a r'pris sans aventure
Y a plus personne pour nous chiper des confitures
Le Général au bistrot
Avait planté un drapeau
Pour la patrie j'ai payé la facture

Je ne suis plus jamais retourné au marché
Mais quelques fois dans le ciel de la nuit d'été
On voit briller cinq étoiles
Et ça nous fait un peu mal
Oh n'achetez jamais un Général",General a Vendre
Les Frères Jacques,"Ca nous a pris trois mois complets
Pour dÈcouvrir quels Ètaient ces projets
Quand le pËre nous l'a dit c'Ètait trop beau

D'un bond, d'un seul et sans hÈsitations
On s'document' sur la navigation,
En moins d'huit jours
Nous f?m's persuadÈs
Qu' la mer pour nous
N'aurait plus de secrets.

Refrain:
Encore heureux qu'il  ait fait beau
Et qu' la Marie-Joseph soit un bon bateau,

Le pËre alors fit preuve d'autoritÈ
"" J'suis ingÈnieur, laissez-moi commande. ""
D'vant l'rÈsultat on lui a suggÈrÈ
"" Qu'un vrai marin vienn' nous accompagner. ""

Alors j'ai dit : "" j'avais prendre la direction
Ancien marin j'sais la navigation ""

CÙtÈs jeunes filles c'Ètaient pas mal
Ca nous a coutÈ l'Ècoute de grand' voile
En la coupant Maguy dit : "" j'me rappelle
Qu'un d'mes louv'teaux voulait de la ficelle ""

Refrain

Pour la deuxiËme fallait pas la laisser
Toucher la barre ou mÍme s'en approcher
Car en moins d'deux on Ètait vent debout
"" J'aime tant l'expression, disait-elle, pas vous ? ""

Quand finalement on a pu rÈparer
Alors on s'est dÈcidÈ ? rentrer.
Mais on n'a jamais trouvÈ l'apontement,
Car ? minuit on n'y voit pas tellement.

Elle avait le nombril en forme de cinq
Et n'en était d'ailleurs pas plus fière pour ça.
On la voyait tous les matins
Tuer le ver avec les copains
Sur le zinc,
Ainsi que vous et moi, sans faire d'embarras.
Et nul, en la voyant, simple, lever son verre,
N’aurait pu se douter que l'accorte commère
Avait le nombril en forme de cinq.

2.
Ah! qui vous chantera, fleurs mystiques, écloses
Parmi les chairs nacrées aux ivoires troublants ? 
Quel poète dira, nombrils, nénuphars roses, 
Le nonchaloir exquis qui mollement vous pose 
Sur le lac pur des ventres blancs ?

3.
Elle avait le nombril en forme de cinq.
Une autre aurait fait des manières,
Une autre aurait fait des chichis,
Aurait cherché, à s'exhiber aux Folies-Bergère
Ou bien encore au Casino de Paris.
Elle, pas du tout .Et quand, en souriant ,
Un ami lui disait: "" Fait donc voir ton nombril ? ""
Elle se dégrafait sans se faire de bile
Et montrait son nombril
Aimai que vous et moi, très simplement !
Elle était si douce et simple !

De cet oeil goguenard que Dieu nous mit au ventre, 
Comme les architectes dans les maisons 
Mettent une rosace au plafond ?

5.
Elle avait le nombril en forme de cinq.
Une autre aurait affiché la prétention
D'être le clou tant cherché d'une exposition.
Elle, pas du tout. Elle allait aux expositions sans pose,
Avec son petit chapeau de paille noire à rubans roses :
Son nombril ne lui faisait pas du tout tourner la boule,
Et si dans les flots pressés de la foule,
Quelque vieux marcheur lui pinçait les fesses 
(Elle est si débauchée au jour d'aujourd'hui la jeunesse),
Elle préférait se laisser faire sans rien dire, 
Ainsi que vous et moi, se contentant d'en rire, 
Je dois même ajouter qu'elle y prenait plaisir. 
Elle était si douce et si simple !

Une autre serait morte d'une façon tragique, 
Aurait cherché quelque suicide dramatique, 
Histoire de défrayer longuement la chronique. 
Elle, pas du tout. Elle mourut dans son lit

(Faut-il pas qu'en fidèle historien je le dise) 
Munie des sacrements de l'Eglise.

Quel poète dira vos formes tant diverses,
Nombrils ? Nombrils corrects, nombrils à la renverse
Nombrils en long des faméliques,
Nombrils en large des grosses dames apoplectiques,
Nombrils en porte cochère
Comme en ont trop souvent les accortes bouchères,
Nombrils troublants des folles filles de l'Espagne,
Nombrils gras et béats des curés de campagne,
Nombrils effarés des timides épouses,
Nombrils des gros rentiers, larges comme des bouses,
Nombrils rusés, nombrils malins
Qui avez l'oeil américain ;
Nombrils, moulés ainsi que de petites crottes,
Qui parez l'abdomen des vierges Hottentotes ;
Nombrils mi-clos, nombrils entrebâillés
(Il faut pourtant qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée),
Nombrils en ronds, nombrils en boule,
Nombrils gros comme des ampoules,
Et vous, nombrils en cul-de-poule !
En l'avril d'un babil puéril et subtil,
Ah ! qui vous chantera, nombrils ?

8.
Elle avait le nombril en forme de cinq.
Une autre aurait désiré qu'on la mit en terre
Avec le concours d'un de ces messieurs du ministère,
Qu'il y eut des discours, des musiques.
Elle, pas du tout. Ce fut simple et banal.
Il n'y eut même pas un conseiller municipal,
Mais deux ou trois amis, quelques parents et l’ecclésiastique.

We took some salty bacon and a hammock for a bed
Then we mixed it with the Spaniards in the middle of the Med

There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago
We hired some more and then we started runnin'
All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well Francis Drake said if you really want a fight
The best thing is to catch them in the middle of the night
We hoisted anchor and powdered up the gun

Well cannon balls flew and the ship began to sink
The water started risin' so we really had to think
And then by chance stood a man as black as coal
So we grabbed him by the trousers and we plugged him in the hole

Well we hired our funds saw the pretty girls a comin'

We hired some more and then we started runnin'
All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well we fired from the side port and we fired from the back
And then we fired from the galley and through every little crack
We fired so much that the cook started cooking

Les Ingénues,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And I am a fool for beauty

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

en la selva de CuruzÃº CuatiÃ¡,

Â¡Indieciiiita! cÃ¡lida why fragante como una flor (como una flor)
Â¡Indieciiiita! bella why candorosa como una estrella dame tu amor (y a nosotros tambiÃ©n)
Â¡Indieciiiita! fresca pura why joven, graciosa paloma, tierna why atractiva,
cual flor de ceigo del ParanÃ¡ (y del Uruguay)
doncella desnuda que habitas la selva,
tu cuerpo felino de peine why pantera golpea en la sabia de mi cora-zÃ³n,
cuando siento tu canto de virgen morena,
graciosa why deseable por que eres Â¡Indieciiiita! (PIO PIO, PIO)

Me acerquÃ© temblando por su hermosura,
se acercÃ³ why de pronto me sonriÃ³,
me acerque mirÃ¡ndola con ternura (uy, uy, uy)

acurriÃ³ que:

Me fui caminado con mi jangada,

- No, no la indiecita, Â¿que paso?
- Ah, la indiecita, usted quiere detalles
- Si
- Eh, bueno ella estaba allÃ­ Â¿no?, en la selva, estaba desnuda, sensual, why se me despertÃ³ el indio

Les Luthiers,"Aquella, habrÃ­a sido una tranquila maÃ±ana de otoÃ±o en el bosque, una maÃ±ana de otoÃ±o comÃºn why corriente, si no fuera que ya eran las cuatro de la tarde why estaban en verano. 
Todos los animales habÃ­an sido citados por la princesa Teresa en un claro del bosque para averiguar cual de ellos era su prometido, el duque Sigfrido el Erguido. 
El duque, habÃ­a sido hechizado por la bruja Granuja, que no sÃ³lo lo habÃ­a transformado en algÃºn animal del bosque, sino que ademÃ¡s, le habÃ­a quitado la memoria.
El pajarillo Amarillo, cantaba alegremente. El pajarillo decÃ­a: â??Solo el amor de la princesa puede devolver la forma humana al duqueâ??. 
En ese momento, se presentÃ³ el jabalÃ­ AlÃ­. El jabalÃ­ preguntÃ³: â??Â¿Por lo de la princesa es aquÃ­?â?? 
â??Siâ??, dijo el pajarilloâ?? Nos han citado a todos. A propÃ³sito, ahÃ­ viene, arrastrÃ¡ndose, el molusco Parduscoâ??. 
El molusco preguntÃ³: â??He perdido mi caparazÃ³n. Â¿No lo vieron?â?? 
En ese momento, apareciÃ³ volando la mariposa Golosa. â??Â¡Socorro!â??, se quejaba la mariposa, â??Â¡Me persigue el oso Libidinoso!â??, why apareciÃ³ corriendo tras ella, el oso Libidinoso. 
El oso, perseguÃ­a a la mariposa ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita why recitÃ¡ndole un poema que decÃ­a: â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, mariposa, que acelera mis latidos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â??. 
El molusco se interpuso. El oso bramÃ³: â??Â¿Y tÃº que quieres, despreciable molusco?â?? 
â??Â¿No vio mi caparazÃ³n?â?? 
El instante fue aprovechado por la mariposa Golosa, que se escondiÃ³ ayudada por el pajarillo Amarillo. 

HacÃ­a ya tres lunas que la bruja habÃ­a hechizado al duque. La hermosa princesa Teresa deambulaba en su bÃºsqueda, lamentÃ¡ndose de su suerte. La acompaÃ±aban en silencio sus fieles gansos Mansos.
El pajarillo anunciÃ³: â??Â¡Ya llega la princesa! Â¡Que triste estÃ¡!â??, why apareciÃ³ la princesa. 
Entonces, apareciÃ³ la bruja Granuja. La bruja se burlaba: â??Â¡Nunca sabrÃ¡s en que animal he convertido al duque! Â¡Ni siquiera Ã©l recuerda nada, ja ja ja!â?? 

La princesa clamaba: â??Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡s, Sigfrido, Sigfrido? Â¿QuÃ© clase de animal eres?â?? 
Los gansos consolaban a la princesa: â??Â¡TranquilÃ­zate!â??, dijo el gansito pequeÃ±o, â??Ten calmaâ??, agregÃ³ la gansa robusta, â??Todo irÃ¡ bienâ??, dijo el ganso viejo. 
â??Â¿No vio mi caparazÃ³n?â?? 

De pronto, la gansa robusta lanzÃ³ un grito de indignaciÃ³n, le dio una tremenda bofetada a un cuarto ganso enorme que estaba a su lado why saliÃ³ corriendo. El ganso enorme no era otro que... Â¡el oso libidinoso disfrazado!, que corrÃ­a a la gansa ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita al grito de â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, gansita, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â?? 
Los gansos fueron en ayuda de la gansa robusta, why la princesa se quedÃ³ sola. 
â??No debo flaquearâ??, dÃ­jose la princesa, â??no debo flaquear, debo encontrar al duqueâ??, pero en ese momento, se hicieron oÃ­r los bajos instintos de la princesa: â??Olvida al duque. Recuerda los abrazos de aquel fornido palafrenero de palacioâ??. â??Pero debo cumplir con mi deberâ??. â??Â¿Y si algo falla why el hechizo de rompe sÃ³lo a medias? El duque podrÃ­a quedar medio animal...â?? â??Bueno, en eso es igual el palafrenero...â?? 

Mientras esto sucedÃ­a en el bosque, veamos que pasaba en una pacÃ­fica granja cercana. 
El granjero, silbando distraÃ­damente, ordeÃ±aba a la vaca Resaca. La vaca rumiaba sus pensamientos... why otras flores que habÃ­a comido esa maÃ±ana. â??Â¡Que extraÃ±o!â??, pensaba la vaca Resaca, â??es la primera vez que me ordeÃ±a de tarde...â?? why mirÃ³ al granjero. Resaca lanzÃ³ un mugido why saliÃ³ corriendo. El granjero no era otro que... Â¡el oso Libidinoso disfrazado!, quien comenzÃ³ a perseguirla ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita al grito de â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, vaquita, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â??.

En el bosque, la princesa, ayudada por los gansos Mansos, se habÃ­a interrogado a casi todos los animales, pero no habÃ­a logrado averiguar cual de ellos era el duque. Una triste desazÃ³n invadiÃ³ a la princesa. 
De pronto, los gansos, viendo llegar al pajarillo why a la mariposa, bramaron: â??Ustedes dos, Â¿quÃ© hacÃ­an la noche en que el duque fue hechizado?â??. â??Nada, nadaâ??. â??Â¡Confiesen!â??, (marcha nupcial)â??y bien, si, pero nos vamos a casarâ??. Un fracaso mÃ¡s. Otra triste desazÃ³n invadiÃ³ a la princesa. 
Teresa, alzÃ³ sus bellos ojos, como implorando ayuda a los que la rodeaban. Hasta que su mirada se cruzÃ³ con la del jabalÃ­ AlÃ­. â??Â¡Miren!, Â¡Si, si, no hay duda!â??, dijo la princesa, â??Â¡el jabalÃ­ tiene la misma mirada que el duque!â??. El jabalÃ­, con sombrÃ­a voz declarÃ³: â??Es que yo no soy un jabalÃ­â??. â??Â¡Oh!â??. â??Â¡Yo soy... Â¡â??. â??Â¡Ã?l es... !â??. â??Un duque hechizadoâ??. â??Â¡El duque Sigfrido!â??. â??No, el duque de Mantuaâ??. â??Â¿Y que haces aquÃ­?â??, preguntÃ³ sorprendida la princesa. â??Â¡Me echaron de Rigoletto!â??. La Ãºltima posibilidad habÃ­a fracasado. Otra triste desazÃ³n mÃ¡s invadiÃ³ a la princesa.
De pronto, de la espesura surgiÃ³ el oso Libidinoso why exclamÃ³: â??Â¡Aguarde! Â¡Al ver a Teresa recuperÃ© la memoria! Â¡Ahora entiendo la causa de mi vergonzoso desenfreno! Â¡He sido vÃ­ctima de un hechizo cruel! Â¡Gracias, amor mÃ­o, por venir a salvarme! Â¡Yo soy el duque Sigfrido!â??. Dicho esto, el oso arrancÃ³ una margarita, why viendo la alegrÃ­a en el rostro de la princesa Teresa, se dirigiÃ³ a su encuentro triunfalmente. El oso le ofreciÃ³ la margarita a la princesa, pero en ese momento, la bruja Granuja se interpuso, why con aire trÃ¡gico gritÃ³: â??Â¡TÃº no eres el duque, farsante! No puedo soportar este atropello. Â¡Yo no sirvo para bruja! Lo hago para complacer a mi familia. El duque Sigfrido es el moluscoâ??, why la bruja se fue llorando, mientras el oso, conmovido, corrÃ­a tras ella, ofreciÃ©ndole la margarita. 
Todos felicitaron al molusco, quien avanzÃ³ hacia la princesa lentamente, como un duque. Mientras el molusco agradecÃ­a los aplausos, Teresa lo tomÃ³ con amor, why lo depositÃ³ suavemente sobre la palma de su mano. why ante el asombro why el esfuerzo de Teresa, el molusco se fue transformando en un joven esbelto why hermoso: El duque Sigfrido. 

AllÃ­ estÃ¡n Sigfrido why Teresa, con los corazones entrelazados, mirÃ¡ndose a las manos why con los ojos latiendo al unÃ­sono. why ya inician su triunfal regreso al palacio. Los animales los escoltan en eufÃ³rico cortejo. 
Todos bailan alegremente. why allÃ¡ van, encabezando el cortejo, el duque, la princesa, why su flamante dama de compaÃ±Ã­a que no es otra que... disfrazado, el oso Libidinoso.",Teresa y el Oso

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Les McCann,"When somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you - all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you - all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
Thats how deep it goes - if its real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless he needs you - all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years - come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if youll let me love you
Its for sure Im gonna love you - all the way, all the way

Dans le vieux port de Nazare

Avalée par les flots,

Les deux pieds dans une botte,

Dit touche pas, il mijote
C'est le fruit de la marée.

Qui toutes vêtues de noir
Se nourrissent de crustacés

Malgre moi, elle se glisse entre nous

Mais mon tabou me rend trop egoiste

Elle envahit mon corps, mon etre
C'est un mystere, qui rend fous

Contre ma paire d'yeux
Regarde-moi de loin
Comme si mon garde do corps était dieu
J't'avais pas vu dans la mire
Un pavé dans l'amour
Endure tes vers pour entendre les gens dire
Qu'tu m'rendras légendaire

See'est qu'sans amour, on crève

Tu veux partager see'que je suis
See'que j'vaux, see'que j'vis
See'que j'vois, see'que j'ai vu
Et après on verra
Si l'amour meurt, alors dis moi see'qu'il reste
Des cases vides, des causes injustes
Juste des gestes

Tu dis qu'tu tuerais pour moi
Trouve une cible émouvante
Prouve-moi que tu m'aimes à mort
Au moins autant qu'tu t'en vantes

La balle au bout do fusil
Le fusil à bout de bras
Do braconnier à bout de souffle
La balle siffle
Un corps s'affale sa vie défile
Le bourreau s'tire dans la foule
Et moi, émue, je reste couchée

Il a fait des offrandes aux Dieux
Et des dons funéraires aux morts bienheureux

Cheikh Anta Diop est un homme qui ala bouche pure

Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last.

To be a rock and not to roll.

That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes

Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours

Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still, I'm hoping all the while
You'll give me
Just one more word
I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out

I paid for it with hours of loneliness

Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.

Les Paul,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Les Paul,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

But quickly drove away.

In a one-horse open sleigh.

Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Les Paul,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

When you taught me how to say

Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled

The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me 
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii 
With all this loveliness there should be love 
Come with me while the moon is on the sea 
The night is young and so are we, so are we 
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii 
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

Les Paul,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses

Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing

Stumbling all around so funny

then you will surely adore Argentina
You'll be as gay as can be

For mister soon as you learn  
then you will never return to Manhattan

you'll still a kiss and then

But nigga's in school is scared of the Good fellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fucking move until I say so

So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span

Je marchais sur la plage
Quand les dunes, le vent dans les pins
Montraient plus d'un seul visage
Les étoiles, au firmament, prenaient leur temps

Je l'ai vu dans le lointain
Allongé vers ces deux vagues
Allangui comme un noyé
Mais plein d'une vie formidable
Vers lui j'ai marché, comme illuminée, j'allais

Paressant au bord de l'eau
Il rêvait les yeux ouverts
De grands yeux verts, un menton triangulaire
Et une queue de poisson, un triton de Poséïdon

Une question, permets moi
Dis Triton comme je te vois
Qu'il me brûle de savoir comment
Vous foutez pour qu'il y ait des enfants

Triton embrasse-moi
Connaissez-vous l'ivresse, des profondeurs du bonheur d'amour
Une caresse me fît taire
Et il parla

Cette queue que tu touches là
Est un noeud comme tu n'en as pas
Un engin fort comme une un dauphin
La femelle, elle, c'est son vagin

Nous faisons tourbillons
Quand sa nageoire caudale s'ouvre comme une fleur des mers
La tempête hurle et bastonne
Et les hommes ont peur, bonheur

Dans un élan
Il file déjà au loin
Et l'écume scintillait
Si joliment

to pay the rent at the holy land
a trailer park in a shantytown
hook up and water, no money down. . .

she crossed her legs and held her pinkie straight up
bourbon, bitters, a sugarcube
it ain't a mint julep, but it'll do. . .

i know'd jimmy since we were kids
whatever he wanted is whatever we did
lying by the river where the rushes grew high
growing up fast 'neath the midnight sky. . .

we used to race that northbound train
motorcycle pumping like a junkie's vein
our headlight was the moon above
and the road curled 'round us like a tunnel of love
when the days dragged by like a wounded dog
in the delta dirt of broken dolls
hey, hi, we would fly
to the cool muddy waters of the riverside
in the holy land

momma died drunk and daddy died straight
jimmy left town on that northbound train
folks all swore the boy'd go far
'cuz he played like a demon on a slide guitar
he said he'd sing for me and the holy land

and me, i don't do much but count my cares
on this sagging front porch in momma's old chair

feeling safe was worth the fight

survive a knife in the back

You'd lose too much blood, my Van Gogh, to lend an ear
But it'd be perfect, if after I hurt you, you say

For at least today"" and you don't run, you don't go away

And freedom is a coin with two sides
Head tells you love beats tail
but darling, I know you're walking the same fine line

when we were walking the same fine line

or a Coltrane chord held high with a 7th flat

A thin blue line is the smoke from a cigarette
or lips drawn cold and lifeless from lack of breath
But the sky round the earth?
I won't forget a thin blue line

Lying in the cool green grass, the sky is an endless blue
Sitting on Jupiter presents a different point of view
Both up and down I see these blues collide inside of me
One fucked-up frame of mind leaves seven generations on the line

A thin blue line is the core of a flame
burning oil fields in God's name
But the sky round the earth does that explain
A thin blue line

A thin blue line, oh just sign the check
A hole in the ozone? Well, what the heck
but the sky around the earth
I wouldn't place your bet on a thin blue line

to disappear, the earth would be a moon)

Blackouts on Thursday!
Total blackouts are where it's at.
I'm going back to high school
Where I can make out like a cat.

It's a shake down.
A mental breakdown,
Is this a take down?
We're gonna make out.

The band sort of sucks,
But the audience sucks too much.
I'm going back to high school,
Where the audience plays rough.

It's a shake down.

I'll stuff you full of snuff.
Meet me on the bearskin rug,

For the storm to break. 
Someone is lost outside, 
Through the rain we hear them cry. 
Deafened by the sound 
Of the apples falling down. 
They were rotting on the ground

And when the ax-blade bit his neck,
""Set me free"" is all he said.

I've heard the Titan stirring,

Before pitchforks and torches
Ferdinand made his last stand.

The farmer dropped his sword

The children it had frightened
Were even more scared now.
The minister and mayor told the people to be proud.

My family said,

Deep inside my castle walls
Spend my nights with concubine
Wasted, unchaste, drunk on blood red wine

And I'd be in throne still
Had I not one day fallen ill

My vision went soft too
And my chest got tight

They gagged and bounded me
And threw me out into the night

Out in the mud I sadly sighed

Everyone inside is getting high tonight
Waiting for the plague to move on
No one's getting sober till the liquors all gone""

Les Tambours du Bronx,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Refuse/Resist
Les Thugs,"All the rain came down
On a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand
That always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Les Voix Humaines,"Can she excuse my wrongs with Virtue's cloak? 
 Shall I call her good when she proves unkind? 
 Are those clear fires which vanish into smoke? 
 Must I praise the leaves where no fruit I find? 
 No no: where shadows do for bodies stand, 
 Thou may'st be abus'd if thy sight be dim. 
 Cold love is like to words written on sand, 
 Or to bubbles which on the water swim. 
 Wilt thou be thus abused still, 
 Seeing that she will right thee never? 
 If thou canst not o'ercome her will 
 The love will be thus fruitless ever. 
 Was I so base, that I might not aspire 
 Unto those high joys which she holds from me? 
 As they are high , so high is my desire: 
 If she this deny, what can granted be? 
 If she will yeld to that which reason is, 
 It is Reason's will that Love should be just. 
 Dear make me happy still be granting this, 
 Or cut off delays if that die I must. 
 Better a thousand times to die, 
 Than for to live thus still tormented: 
 Dear, but remember it was I 
 Who for thy sake did die contended","Can she excuse my wrongs, for 4 voices & lute (First Book of Songs)"

My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

May well be simple but they're true

Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen

To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn

Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!

You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories,
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye.",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again

But now the clouds have passed

All who love are blind,
When you heart's on fire, you must realize, 
Smoke gets in your eyes.

So I chaffed them, and I gaily laughed, 
To think they would doubt our love,
And yet today, my love has gone away,
I am without my love.

Now laughing friends deride,
Tears I cannot hide,
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes,

Smoke gets in your eyes.

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace

Lesley Garrett,"There was a time when men were kind 
When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather

I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Leslie Clio,"Darkness is a filler
And there happened to be space
If I was someone else, I'd be perfect
If she is what you want
I'm getting tired to be me
Could use to be less alone
And I never stay away from danger
But I could be careful
Got nowhere to go with you, no
Hollow morals marching on
And I'm a lonesome woman alone

And the more I get, the more I lose
The only way up is down
And doves won't fly when I return
The only way up is down

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

Darkness is a filler
And there happened to be space
And being someone else would be perfect
Where's my mind gone, where's my mind?
Why did I get so tired?
If she really willing to do what I didn't
And why'd you stop believing in me?
Don't let me paint another picture
Paint another picture
Of the lonesome woman they see

And the more I get, the more I lose
The only way up is down
And doves won't fly when I return
The only way up is down

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

A little restlessness stresses less
I walk alone
Maybe someday you'll find me
I hope you still come
Left with my restlessness, restiveness (if I could, I'd believe him)
I walk alone
Maybe someday you you'll find me (I still walk alone)
Someone to call my own

(I still walk alone!)

And the more I get
The more I lose

You send out warnings
I refused to see them

Now I'm just cynical

You think you're cleaver but, mmm

Just look at me now, ooh

Promises broken 
The heart has spoken 
Just look at me now, fragile 

Never like anybody
I took so long to cry
Feeling so dumb now (You just seem really evil)

I'm trying hard but your cryptical talking 
Won't tell me nothing
Except that I should run and run out 

'Cause I don't need no one
That I can overcome 
Could be so simple but, mmm

Can't work it out, work it out

Looks good from afar 
But hope runs out, hope runs out

And how bad to you want it?
How many highs and lows?
How many yes and no's?

Loved how you are so unlike him
Maybe I'm magnified
Your love is no place to hide 
You're changing my mind again 
 
Stop turning the house to black
If you're so sure then don't come back
Already know about what happens once you're out 
You're changing your mind again
 
How many times did we get over this
How much more ways to laugh at this
How many cons and pros 
Maybe God only knows
You do it again
 
You kidding me, you can't be serious

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Leslie Hutchinson,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

Ring-ting-tingling too,

For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling

For a sleigh ride together with you.

Let's go, let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up,

We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.

And comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be,
Let's take that road before us,
And sing a chorus or two,

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray,
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day,
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop,
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in this world can buy,
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie,
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives,
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

Like the earth holds on to the moon

When I know that I just don't belong to you
I'm preparing to meet my doom
It's gonna come one day soon
If I don't stop loving you

I saw the warning signs
Long before our hearts aligned
But I couldn't stop myself
I loved every inch of the ride
And somehow you crept up inside
Where I could forget myself

But why am I still thinking of you
When I can't have you although I want you
Pretty soon I'll be lost in the rain
My world quietly slipping away
And I'll only have myself left to blame
If I don't stop loving you

If I don't stop loving you
There'll be hell to pay

The talk of the town
And nobody would ever know

Where we couldn't be found

At the end of the street
Tangled and twisted our bodies
Caught up in the heat

Everything perfect but somehow
We missed the beat
We crossed the line

And now there's no easy way out
And now there's no easy way out
And now there's no easy way out
For us tonight, no easy way out
But somehow it will be alright

Love has a habit of setting you up for a fall
One minute high as a kite
Then you're feeling so small
Free as a bird and then feeling
Chained to the wall, we lost our minds

Waiting, for somebody to rescue me

It was always here inside my heart
No more fairy tale pretending

I wouldn't reach up to the sky, every night in my dreams

And there's a star that's shining down on me
Reflecting everything that I can be
Every journey starts inside my heart
And there's no mountain that's too far

Whatever it is I can do it

That`s running out of sand
I`m looking through the hourglass

Leslie Phillips,"I met you once backstage
At a very tender age
You took me under your wing
And I remember
Those seas of screaming hands
Were at your own command
So hypnotized when you sing

And there seemed to be a price to pay
Getting bigger every day

And you were larger than life
You were graded up to 'hero'
Larger than life
And it must be hard to keep living
The things that you say
When they're making you larger than life

I'm learning what it means
To be somebody's dream
When I'm looking for the dream myself
But that's not really me
They're twisting what they see
Its only one hero to Hell

And there seems to be a price to pay
Getting higher every day

Larger than life
We're graded up to 'hero'
Larger than life
And you know its hard to keep living
The things that we say
When they're making us larger
Larger than life

And the higher you're above it all
The easier it is to fall

Larger than life
Larger than life",Larger Than Life
Leslie Phillips,"Have you seen my girl? 
She's the one with the curly hair. 
She was sitting just right over there, now she's nowhere to be found. 

I think she's mad at me. 
I don't know why. 
Maybe because I made her cry when I told her I was down. 

She only likes me when I'm high
She's always trying to get me stoned
She wants to see me in her sky
And has to have me there alone
She's got me on my knees, begging baby, baby please! 
Don't hurt me, no, don't hurt me so 

As a gentleman 
I do everything I can to be 
A law-abiding kind of energy, 
Yet stimulating all the while

Then she comes around. 
I don't know why. 
I always go too fucking far 
And end up puking on the bathroom tile, oh my! 

She's tracking, 
She tracks me down, 
She's bound to drag me down",Smoke Screen
Leslie Phillips,"Ever since I became one of yours
I`m a target for the kill
The enemy is on my trail
Wants to own my will

Shots of guilt with every surge
Of enticing attack
Part of me wants to surrender now
But my heart fights back

(Chorus)
Tug of War
Pulling my mind
Back and forth
All the time

In the stillness of my lonely room
I felt the passion of God`s heart
Oh, You know I want to do what`s right
But I`m so torn apart

Leslie Sanazaro,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Leslie Uggams,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine

You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Yeah, Mississippi Queen",Mississippi Queen
Leslie West,"Never in my life
Could i find a girl like you
Never in my life 
Could i find a girl like you
When i wake up in the morning
You make me feel so good
Bringing me the cider whisky
Feel a bit lonely too

For the first time in my life
I finally found someone like you
For the first time in my life
I finally found someone like you
I feel like a bolt of lightning
But it feels so good
Knowin´ my baby´s waitin´
And of course i do
Hey hey hey

Never in my life
Could i find a girl like you
Never in my life
Could i find a girl like you
When i turned around to wake her
About the way she moves
I don´t want to leave her
But i wanta love you too 
",Never in My Life
Leslie West,"When the wagons leave the city
For the forest and further on
Painted wagon of the morning
Dusty roads where they've gone
Sometimes travelin´ through the darkness
At the summer comin´ home
Forcing faces by the wayside
Look as if they hadn't known
All the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that´s dry
In a country town 
Where the map was found
Oh the dancing and the singing
Oh the music when they play
Oh the fire that they saw there
On the grave of no return
Sometimes they found it
Sometimes they kept it
Often lost in on the way
Pawnee shadow to possess him
Sometimes ride inside of day
Oh the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that´s dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
Oh the sad was in their eye
And the desert that´s dry
In a country town 
Where the wagons bound",Theme for an Imaginary Western
Leslie West,"Don't you send for the doctor 'cause I'm dyin' the blues
I got nothin' to live for and nothin' to lose

And I know in my mind, in my heart
That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

And I know in my heart it's all up to you
To give me the chance that I gave to you
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

And I know in my mind, in my heart
That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

And I know in my mind it's all up to you
You gotta know in your heart, it's all up to you
Would you please give me the chance that I gave to you",The Doctor
