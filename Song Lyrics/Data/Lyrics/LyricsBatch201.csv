Joe Walsh,"Sometimes I can't make my mind up
Don't know which way to go
If I should do this or if I should do that
I don't know
In certain situations

Sometimes a man can get in trouble
Through no fault of his own
Like when your girlfriend answers with a simple, ""Hello""
And you're in the shower, and it's your wife on the phone! Oh!
In certain situations

And sometimes luck don't seem to matter at all
When you're hot, you're hot
And sometimes you have to play the cards as they fall
That's the only chance you got
In certain situations, situations

Oh, oh, oh
In certain situations
Oh, in certain situations

And sometimes luck don't seem to matter at all
When you're caught, you're caught, oh, woah
And sometimes you have to play the cards as they fall
That's the only chance you've got
In certain situations, situations, situations",Certain Situations
Joe Walsh,"Was it like it happened while you're nappin'? coyote love
Wake up in a messy, unfamiliar place
Look over at an unfamiliar face
Coyo-coyote love
Coyote love

Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, coyote love
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, coyote love

Howlin' at the moon, 'cause you, you've had your fill
Coyote love
All you lose is one arm and a hunk out of your hair
Coyote love

Well, this can't really happen, this can't be real!
Somethin' lyin' next to me, looks like I feel! oh no!
Aaah!!!

Joe Walsh,"Minutes turn to hours, counting seconds tick away. 
Another day tomorrow, tomorrow's just another day. 
Days turn into years, and time goes by, over and over, 
Again and again, and then, years turn into decades. 
Decades. Start another decade, times ten. 
Ten decades, one hundred years. 
Ten decades. And the first ten started going so much faster, 
Than the whole one hundred years before. 

And the second ten we started fighting. 
We fought the war to end all wars. 
So somebody named the twenties roaring, 
And in the thirties we fought some more. 
And the fighting went on and on (and on); 
Nobody could stop it (stop it, stop it) 
So somebody built a bomb (bomb); 
All you had to do was drop it (drop it), right or wrong. 
They dropped it; they dropped it. 
And toward the end of the forties, after the storm, I was born. 

I am calling, across a field, from far away, far away. 
This is my calling song; I am worried, I am concerned. 
There are reasons, can't be explained. 
And there are questions, that have no answers. 
That's the reason I want to know: how long, how long, can this go on? 
I want to know how long, how long, 
When so many things happen, nothing gets done. 
So many wars, no one ever won one, and no one
Ever will, 
No one ever will. 
I am calling, this is my calling song. 

And the fifties were the best I guess, except for the fighting 
And the sixties were unrest, oh yes, we went to the moon. 
We had hopes, we had dreams, 
And sometimes late at night it still seems like,
Camelot. 
And the seventies lasted 'til May. 
And on the hill, that day, I gave up and started writing Decades. 
And the eighties were a waste of time, and here we are, in the nineties! 
Nine in a row, one more to go, oh! Over and over, again and again. 
One hundred years; ten years times ten. 
So many things happened, nothing got done. 
So many wars, no one ever won one. 
Decades, decades",Decades
Joe Walsh,"Have you ever seen yourself on TV?
Well, I have
Have you ever been more famous than me?
Well, I have
Have you been stung by a bee?
Well, I have
Have you ever met Mohamed Ali?
I have, I have!

Have you ever had a case of the flu?
Well, I have
Have you ever had to escape from a zoo?
I have
Have you ever met the guys in the Who?
Well, I have
I'm in Who's Who, are you?
I am!

Have you ever stood in line at the bank?
Had an uncle named Frank?
Have you ever rode around in a tank?
I have!

But I've never been to Fairbanks, Alaska
That's the only place I've never been
Have you ever been everywhere else?
I have, I have!

Have you ever locked your keys in your car?
Well, I have
Have you ever been thrown out of a bar?
I have
But I've never shot eighteen-under-par
And I still don't know where all those balls are
Except the one that went through somebody's car
One time in Lincoln, Nebraska

And some day I'm goin' to Fairbanks, Alaska
If it's the last thing I ever do
Have you ever done everything else?
I have, too
I have!",Fairbanks Alaska
Joe Walsh,"I have a friend
    He's like my brother
    And every now and then we sit down
    And we talk to each other

    One time we talked
    All about the future
    And we shared each others' dreams and plans
    For later on, when we both had time at hand
    And weren't so damn busy
    Me and my friend

    And the thing I don't understand
    Dear God, where is he?
    Where is he?

    And so my friend, I must say
    So long, for now
    Your time is over
    I must go on

    You are my brother
    This is your song
    It will last forever, forever, forever
    We'll be friends that long",The Friend Song
Joe Walsh,"I know things aren't the same as they were before
Oh baby, I know, and all I can say is I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

And I don't know if you think of me anymore
But I still love you
I still love you, too",I Know
Joe Walsh,"I'm not a gambling man, that's one thing you can bet
    But that's all right, (yes, it's all right), all right with me
    I may get lucky, but it hasn't happened yet
    But that's all right (yes, it's all right), all right with me

    I'm on the ceilin' if I'm anywhere at all
    But that's all right (yes, it's all right), all right with me
    Fallin' up the stairs or bouncin' down the hall
    It's all right

    (Well, it's all right)
    Well, it's all right
    (Well, it's all right, yes, it's allright)
    Well, it's all right! Well, it's all right!
    (It's all right!)
    (Well, it's all right)

    I do my best and that's the best that I can do
    But that's all right (yes, it's all right), all right with me
    Sometimes it seems a workin' man is never through
    But that's all right, all right with me
    Well, it's all right",It's All Right
Joe Walsh,"Some friends of mine I never met called me the other day 
They was gonna have a party and they called me to say 
Hey Joe, how ya doin', how's your album, how's your tour 
How's Don Henley, how's Glenn Frey, 
And who, what where and when and why 
They could not shut up (can't shut up) 
They couldn't shut up (can't shut up) 
So I hung up (can't shut up) 

Well I followed their directions and arrived a little late 
I had a couple Chardonnays and started feelin' great 
I said I hate to interrupt, I'll be right back I gotta pee 
30 people in the bathroom started talkin' to me 
They could not shut up (can't shut up) 
(can't shut up) 
I said hey, shut up (can't shut up) 
They could not shut up 

Well, just to get out of the bathroom took the rest of the year, 
And then a polyester pantsuit named Mandingo grabbed my ear 
Said I heard you're rich and famous but I don't know who you are 
You gotta sign this for my nephew or he won't believe I met you 
She just could not shut up (can't shut up) 
No, no she could not shut up (can't shut up) 
She couldn't shut up (can't shut up) 
I said: ""Shut up"" (can't shut up) 
She could not shut up (can't shut up) 
She, she, she, she could not shut up (can't shut up) 
No, no, no she could not shut up (can't shut up) 
She said: ""blah, blah, blah"" (can't shut up) 
I said: ""hahahaha, Shut up"" 
Shut up (can't shut up)",Shut Up
Joe Walsh,"Is anyone out there? 
Does anybody listen or care anymore? 
We are living on a dying planet, 
We're killing everything that's alive, 
And anyone who tries to deny it 
Wears a tie 
And gets paid to lie 
So I wrote these songs for a dying planet, 
I'm sorry but I'm telling the truth, 
And for everybody trying to save it 
These songs are for you, too. 
Is anyone out there?",Song for a Dying Planet

Joe Walsh,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

And I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Will you still love me
Will you still love me
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
Joe Walsh,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You

Joe Walsh,"Uh, sleep all day, out all night,
I know where you're going.
I don't that's a-acting right,
You don't think it's showing.
A-jumpin' up, fallin' down,
Don't misunderstand me.
You don't think that I know your plan,
What you try'n to hand me?

Out all night, sleep all day,
I know what you're doing.
If you're gonna a-act that way,
Think there's trouble brewing.",Funk No 49
Joe Walsh,"Somewhere along the way I found the meaning
Woke up dreaming along the way
Never quite seems the same when you awaken
And makin' up for the time is such a price to pay
Then they take your dream away and it just ain't fair

Help me through the night, mama
Help me ease the pain
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

That's the danger in pretending
Trying to defend yourself from someone else's war
Don't know what they're fighting for
And they just don't care

So help me to see the light, mama
Open my eyes again
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

Would you help me?
Could you help me?
",Help Me Through the Night
Joe Walsh,"When I became of age my mama sat me down 
Said ""Son, you're growin' up, it's time you look around"" 
So I began to notice some things I hadn't seen before 
That's what brought me here knockin' on your back door 
Oh, yeah 

A closet queen, the busstop's dream, she wants to shake my hand 
I don't want to be there, she decides she can 
It's Apple Dan, he's just the man to pick fruit off your branches 
I can't sleep, and we can't keep this cattle on my ranches 
Oh, yeah 

It's too strong, something's wrong and I guess I lost the feelin' 
I don't mind the games you play, but I don't like your dealin'

Will I be back tomorrow for the punchline of the joke?",The Bomber
Joe Walsh,"I see the sun rise
Here comes the day
Where sunrise comes from
I am not knowing

I see with stained eyes
Help find my way
It all surrounds me
It is all snowing, flowing
Here we go

I hear a calling
Each one by name
And so many don't hear
They think it's the same old thing

I feel us falling
Back where we came
It all astounds me
Is it a sad thing, bad thing

I don't know
Oh no",Here We Go
Joe Walsh,"A woman was by to see you
She didn't leave a name
She told me that she loved you
And she said, ""It's all the same""

She said, she'd just been raining
In meadows where you've been
She said, she was a mirror for you
And she wishes, you'd look in

Though she didn't stay too long
Well, I didn't catch her name
She told me that she loved you
She said, ""It's all the same""

Joe Walsh,"We were visited last evening 
By a servant of the day 
He had traveled miles on horseback 
To scout his master's way 

And he only had a moment 
To warm his frozen hands 
And though he needed food and rest 
He told us of his land 

And all too soon 
He had to leave 
Else sleep might block his way 
And so he thanked us both, and saddled up 
And softly rode away 

And I thought I caught a glimpse of sun in his eye 
And wheat field in his smile 
And I couldn't help but a-thinking 
They would follow in a while",Midnight Visitor
Joe Walsh,"You will never see me 
Walking around feeling low 
You will never hear there 
Goes a man who doesn t know 
Too many roads to walk 
Too many things to do 
Too many words to talk 
Moments too few 

I don't think you know 
Though you've been told a million times 
Its not clear to see 
Unless you read in between the lines 
Look out your window 
When did it start? 
Nothing's for certain 
It's just a part 

If you're feeling low, no 
And your world comes tumbling down 
If you see how time stops 
Better take a look around 
Good things must end 
They never last 
Look to tomorrow 
Forget the past",Take a Look Around
Joe Walsh,"Would you like to come home with me? 
I can think of things to show ya 
Thinkin' that I'd like to know ya, uh

Evenin' brings the sun in 
Still I find my way 

Change of plans, makin' a landin' to see ya 
And I do want to be your man, oh, yeah 
Sunday, highway drivin' 
It all looks about the same 
Nowhere, just arrivin' 
Still I play the game 

I'm home grown, growin' my own and I need ya

Joe Walsh,"Welcome to cyberspace, I'm lost in the fog
Everything's digital I'm still analog
When something goes wrong
I don't have a clue
Some ten year old smart a** has to show me what to do

Sit there for days and vegetate
I access my email, read all my spam, I'm an analog man.

The whole world's living in a digital dream
It's not really there
It's all on the screen
Makes me forget who I am

Yeah I'm an analog man in a digital world

Who loves me for what I am

What's wrong with vinyl, I think it sounds great
L-Ps, forty-fives, seventy-eights but that's just the way I am
I'm an analog man

Turn on the tube, watch until dawn
One hundred channels, nothing is on
Endless commercials, endless commercials, endless commercials

The whole world's glued to the cable TV
It looks so real on the big L-C-D
Murder and violence are rated P-G, too bad for the children
They are what they see

The whole world's living in a digital dream
It's not really there
It's all on the screen
Makes me forget who I am

Joe Walsh,"Look out my window see a world that's on fire
Some people think that we should just let it burn
With all this ignorance the flames just get higher (higher)

All of these people with their misinformation
Must be the truth if it's a blog on the screen
We've got to buy it if it's the latest creation

Too many icebergs out on the ocean
Too many chances to sink like a stone
The great Titanic about to go under
And the band played on

I've never known what it was like
To end up somewhere and not have to pack
To be among friends I know have my back

But now I'm here where I belong
I've finally found a wife and a home
And a family that matters, means more to me
Than anything I have ever believed

And when we are gathered together
Tell me how blessed can somebody be

Give thanks, break bread, say grace, bow heads
For all of this love that surrounds me
We laugh, we cry, stand together that's why
It's all being part of a family

Tried it before, never felt right
I never dreamed that someday I might
Be part of something bigger than me
It makes me feel humble, finally I see

All that we have is each other
And that's all that I'll ever need

I got a hunch just what I need
I'm gonna get me some

I was always the first to arrive at the party, ooh
And the last to leave the scene of the crime

And it went I don't know how many years,
Like a runaway train headed for the end of the line

Well I finally got around to admit that I might have a problem
But I thought it was just too damn big of a mountain to climb
Well I got down on my knees and said hey
I just cant go on livin' this way

Oh yeah, one day at a time
Oh yeah, one day at a time

Oh yeah, one day at a time

Lord, I hadn't planned on livin' this long

The eyes of a Spanish Dancer
They dart and they glance
Is it my imagination
Or just part of the dance

Oh how she moves in the moonlight
Everyone under her spell
Wondering just what her smile might imply
Only the shadows can tell

The eyes of a Spanish Dancer
They flirt and they tease
Even the best laid plans
Bring a man to his knees

Heads follow her every move
Seems like time standing still
Measuring chances of taking her home
Shame that no one ever will

The eyes of a Spanish Dancer
Sparkle and glance
Is it my imagination
Or just part of the dance

The eyes of a Spanish Dancer
Candlelight's glow of romance
Is it an invitation
Or just part of the dance

And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left

The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land

You have one just like it, too

And you love me because you are
As fearless as a twisting vine

Like a vagabond with a fishing pole
He whistles but he cannot sing
It's an awful tune

But very soon
I find that i am whistling, too
And your window is like a star
That I sit beneath like a vagabond
Who wears his fear
Just like a scar

The blade of our outrageous fortune
Like a parade, it cuts a path
Light shows on our foolish way
And darkness on
Our aftermath

If I love you, to save myself
And you love me because we are
So fool to think that our parade
Could leave a path
But not a scar

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I watch your sea birds flying

Joe Wick,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through with Love
Joe Williams,"We were more than lovers
We were more than sweethearts
It's so hard to understand

Don't know why it happened
Don't know how it started
Why should we be strangers
After all we planned?

I can't show my face
Can't go anyplace
People stop and stare
It's so hard to bear
Everybody knows you left me
It's the talk of the town
 
Every time we meet
My heart skips a beat
We don't stop to speak
Though it's just a week
Everybody knows you left me
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations
To friends and relations
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations
Gave congratulations
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart
We can't stay apart
Don't let foolish pride
Keep you from my side
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
 
How can you face them?
What can you say?

Joe Williams,"Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so painful to tell me that you're dissatisfied

I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen; you see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way, that bites it even more

Say it
Tell me what you want, yeah
I'll do it, baby
I promise right now
Say it

Who propped you up when you were stopped?
Low motivation had you on the ground

You slide away, hide away, goodbye

Joe Williams,"I'm trying to explain to friends, dear
The reasons we two are apart

That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear

How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

And all that my lady means to me
Like a hearth in the winter, a breeze in the summer

It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady
I pray may she always love me

The smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met

I hear you whisper
""I'll always love you""
I know it's over, and yet
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget

So I must dream
To have your hand caress me
Fingers press me tight

Brings joy I never knew
But to be so near you

Joe Williams,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Ah yes, I was wrong
Again
I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough-ful of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush

Was my heart's domain

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",A Hundred Years from Today/Tomorrow Night

Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying 
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

When Sunny gets blue, pretty dreams will rise up 
Where her other dreams fell through

And leave you with the memories you memorize
To keep your winters warm
How love can turn from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories you've memorized
To keep your winters warm

There's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away?
As long as I'm still in the game, I want to play
For laughs, for life, for love
So here's to life and all the joy it brings
Yes, here's to life
And dreamers and their dreams
May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good gets better

Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you
May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good gets better
Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good gets better
Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you",Here's to Life

Joe Williams,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour
I hung around for three or four
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place
For example, take my case

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china

Maybe a rainbow 
Will catch me then

Will find his way once more

When love was born 
A face on the pillow 
When early morn 
I still see that golden world

A bluer morning sky above

I will set these wonders

When I give my heart, it will be completely

As they strip off their armour in their apartment bedrooms
They wish that somewhere they can find a spark

That someday him and Justice and Nation would get together again
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack
And she wouldn't let nobody in

His tears fall down like missiles from the skies
Justice look into Independence's eyes
Can you make everything alright
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight

Well Nation grew up and got himself a reputation
Couldn't keep the boy at home no no
He just kept running 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame
Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again
Oh Nation don't cry

Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town

Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town

I cannot forget the people who love me

Tears her little world all apart

Good as dead, Sally said
I fear what she knows

Money spent, for reconnaissance
And blood's upon her clothes
Child's toy, soldier boy
Playing with his gun
Uptown, missile clown
Living on the run

He just want to be a big boy
Growing up too soon
Show you his gun
Flash his knife in the sun
And dance to a rock and roll tune

Once tried, twice denied
Sally said she knew
Full sized polarized
Is what she's looking through
Switch blade, promenade
Leather jacket war
Cliche, don't runaway
Slipping out the back door

All night parasite
Wake me up at noon

Down at the Red Dog Saloon
Quick laid, masquerade
Gets the young boy up tight

Says he's gonna be all right",Dream Killin' Town

Rolling here, a one, a two, a one, two, three, die

I ran my fingers through my hair
I watched my life go around in a circle
And I realized that no body but me cares

And I saw the hurt of my system
And I felt the madness of our faults conforming
And I walked around your house for hours
And I could feel that you had me in some kinda of stranglehold

And I don't know why you said those bad things about me

Yeah, now as I recall, hey it wasn't funny at all
But you kept on laughing, huh, like it was some kind of party, yea
Your always looking to belittle someone to make you feel tall

Yea well, it's the same reaction in every situation
Do you really think it's so necessary to be so mean
Yeah, and it's hard for me to justify my position
Yeah, when everything that I'm saying can be said bad about Mr.

Hey now don't you feel sorry, yeah

Where their parents can decide
Hand and hand they walk together
With their broken pride
Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers
And the whole world to decide

I worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary
And my father before me I helped build this land
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands
My family and friends are the best thing I've known
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home

And minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams
That we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out
And be the best you can

By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home

He fell asleep with his head against the window
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind

Life sweeps away the dreams
That we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out
And be the best you can

The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow
I do things my way and I pay a high price
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride
Now that I'm older I can see he was right

Another hot one out on highway eleven
This is my life It's what I've chosen to do
There are no free rides, no one said it'd be easy
The old man told me this my son I'm telling it to you
 
Days turn to minutes
And minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams
That we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out
And be the best you can",Minutes to Memories

John Mellencamp,"She had a dream
And boy it was a good one
So she chased after her dream
With much desire
But when she get too close
To her expectations
Well the dream burned up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinking up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smoking up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

He wanted love
With no involvement
So he chased the wind
That's all his silly life required
And the days of vanity
Went on forever
And he saw his days burn up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinking up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smoking up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

There's a good life
Right across the green fields
And each generation
Stares at it from afar
But we keep no check
On our appetites
So the green fields turn to brown
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinking up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smoking up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder

Couldn't buy the seed to plant this spring and the farmers bank foreclosed 
Called my old friend schepman up to auction off the land 
He said john its just my job and I hope you understand 
Hey calling it your job ol hoss sure dont make it right 
But if you want me to Ill say a prayer for your soul tonight 
And grandmas on the front porch swing with a 
Bible in her hand Sometimes I hear her singing take me to the promised land 
When you take away a mans dignity he cant work his fields and cows

There'll be blood on the scarecrow blood on the plow

Ninety-seven families who lost ninety-seven farms

She got the keys and the car and the home

She didn´t know nobody out there no 
More
And the whole experience just made her
Feel so old

And a bachelor´s degree
Started workin, when he was 21
Got fed up and quit
When he was forty three
He said, ""My whole life
I´ve done, what I supposed to do
Now I´d like to maybe do something
For myself
And just as soon, I figure out what
That is
You can bet your live
I´m gonna give it hell""

Or how old one lives to be

With cake on her fingers
And her wedding ring holding
In her hand was a note

That he was sad and mixed up
And he didn't know what he was doing
That he'd always loved Alice
And he begged for forgiveness
So he threw himself
On the mercy of the jury
And he told how his father
Had beat and abused him
Back in grade school
In the basement den
And that maybe prison
Was the best thing for him

John Mellencamp,"Why do I think there's nobody out there
No one who wants me and no one who knows
I wait in this place and no one can see me
After all this time could I be so alone
I walk through this old town and still feel so lonely
The winds play sad songs high in the trees
The sun never shines this deep in the forest
And I in the darkness or is the darkness in me
I wanna break
I wanna break out
I wanna break
I wanna break out
I want to taste the tears of a lover
Warm as my blood as wet as a kiss
But it's only dark rain that falls in this old town
Old as my memory and as cold as my lips
I wanna break
I wanna break out
I don't wanna fake it
I want to break out
And when I feel lonely
And when I feel lonely
You fly me to the sun
Above this old town
From the top of a tower
I forget about living I forget about pain
At the edge of the platform
At the edge of a heartbeat
Above this old town I flew away

Troubled waters stain the paper cup
From other venues, other voices carry
Spilled dreams soaking into thirsty dust
Maybe then and there you'll find another

Filled with breath and old cells to discover
Strength to push the seas apart

On the day we met I began to lose you too 
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
There may come a day when you feel anger
China cracked and glued by clumsy hand
Veins of memory touching only hunger
The heart devours what it cannot understand
On the day we metI began to want you 
On the day we met I began to lose you too
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
Maybe it was then I saw my future 
Saw it as a shadow on the ground
Beneath the earth old nails 
To discover strength to hold my body down

Two American kids growing up in the heart land
Jack he's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante in the back seat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on chilli dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane sitting on Jacky's lap
Got his hands between her knees
Jack he says:
""Hey, Diane, let's run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks
Let me do what I please""
Saying oh yeah
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone
Sayin' oh yeah
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone

Jack he sits back, collects his thoughts for a moment
Scratches his head, and does his best James Dean
Well, now then, there, Diane, we ought to run off to the city
Diane says:
""Baby, you ain't missing nothing""
But Jack he says:
""Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone""

I cannot forget the people who love me

Break me off a piece of that love tonight

Yeah, it was down in New Orleans
In one of those back-street bars in the quarter
Between Desire and Honalee
You were dancin' with a friend of Michael's
I remember how we met
You were talkin' to ol' Jimmy
And you lit my cigarette

How come you can't remember?
This is me you're talkin' to
From May through September
It was all about me 'n you, baby
It was all about me 'n you

Well it looks like to me
That you have conveniently forgotten everything
This confusion that has surrounded you
Is this your morality and not your brain
You've got a birthmark below your navel
You wear a size seven and a half shoe
You got this Rolex watch that I suspect you cobbed
From that doctor who said he loved you

[Chorus:]

Well you told me that you lived in the wind
Like a bird who never touched the ground
And if you did you would surely die without making a sound
""Live, let's live"", that's all you kept sayin'
And our summer was full of life
We're gonna send them a postcard, and show 'em what it's like to be alive
But I never wanted to leave your side
No, I just couldn't believe that you'd lie
No, I never wanted to say ""good-bye"" baby

There's no reason why HIV shouldn't have missed my daughter and my life
But it did through the eyes of God, he saw fit for me to be here
I will praise the Lord at all times
As we live in the last days the Devil will always be up under my feet
And I will praise his name

And the corporals and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast
But farewell Angelina, the sky is trembling, and I must leave fast

Valentino-type tangos while the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone

When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears

Turned out to be the latest trends
And ther ain't no more progressive music

Walk tall
Yeah walk on

Walk tall

Somewhere out in the distance
Is the death of you and me
Even though we don't think of it much
It's still out there for us to see
If you treat life like a bar room fight
You'll die stinking of gin
No drunkards are allowed in heaven
No sinners will get in

Walk tall
Yeah, walk on
Walk tall
Through this world
Walk tall

So be careful in what you believe in
There's plenty to get you confused
And in this land called paradise
You must walk in many men's shoes
Bigotry and hatred are enemies to us all
Grace, mercy and forgiveness
Will help a man walk tall

So walk tall
Yeah, walk on

Blood on the hands of a arrogant nation

She blamed it on the moon and the sky
She thought she broke the back of the city
She thought, she thought, she knew she had lied

She changed directions with the gas fires burning
Racing for protection, what could she possibly find?
Children with no legs out on the highways crawling
Looking for an angel but they ran out of time

She had blood on her face so she had to get even
She hemorrhaged and bled all over the land
There's blood on the hands of those that kept silent
Who won't count the bodies dead in the sand

She changed directions with the gas fires burning
Racing for protection, what could she possibly find?
Children with no legs out on the highways crawling
Looking for an angel but they ran out of time

Rode all the rides

Put on quite a show

Hey all you suckers
I heard a fat woman say
Come on in for fifty cents
You can stay in here all day

I went inside
Wasn't much there to see
So I asked her for my money back
And she just smiled at me

Rode some rides and played some games
Saw the Wild Man from Borneo
There was a black man playing the blues
Talked to some friends I hadn't seen in a while
Through a football through a hoop

Well I saw them loading up their trucks
Taking down the rides
Folding up all the tents
There's a full moon in the sky
Some were laughing some were cussing
As they worked
Saw one of them making love
To a local girl

I was minding my own business
It was quarter after two
When a fella walked up and said
Hey man
I remember you
And then he shoved me
And pulled out his knife
Stuck me three times in the chest
And I died that night

For the like of me I can't remember

And why he'd put a knife in me

Death to me was just a mystery

And don't get better

Even in its longest days

So you pretend not to notice
That everything has changed
The way that you look
And the friends you once had
So you keep on acting the same
But deep down in your soul
You know you, you got no flame
And who knows then which way to go
Life is short even in its longest days

All I got here

Reflections of where I've been
So you tell yourself I'll be back up on top some day
But you know there's nothing waiting up there for you anyway

Nothing lasts forever
And your best efforts don't always pay
Sometimes you get sick
And you don't get better
That's when life is short
Even in its longest days

Even in its longest days",Longest Days
John Mellencamp,"[Chorus]
I'm not following your frame of mind
Complaining about this life all the time
Surely something good here as the world spins by
Could you please stop being so mean

This will never work out that's what you say
It's the end of the world again yesterday
When I see you coming at me I'm gonna walk away
You need to stop being so mean

Your outlook is haunting us all
Like the ghost of our love down at the dark end of the hall
If you can't say nothing good then don't say nothing at all
And you need to stop being so mean

Your road seems so narrow to me
You're a big boat up the river blowing off steam
My head is spinning from your company
Could you please stop being so mean

[Chorus]",Mean

You'll never desert me

Hey Jesus can you give me a ride back home

I've been out here in this world too long on my own
I won't bother you no more
If you can just get me in the door

When I started out I was so young and so strong
I just let it roll off my back when things went wrong
Now it's starting to get to me
All of this inhumanity

You wouldn't know it by looking at me now
But I was showing some promise once upon a time
But it's gone now
And it ain't coming back

Hey Jesus this world is just too troublesome for me
I try to fight off all these devils but I'm just too weak

I feel like taking my life but I won't
Too big a coward, can you give me a ride back home

But I keep traveling on
Bring peace to this troubled land
It's dark out here
I can't read those signs
Bring peace to the troubled land
Hurricane on the horizon
Judgment getting closer all the time
I can't find tomorrow
Bring peace to this troubled land

Well there's two men a walking
Down the same dirty road
Bring peace to this troubled land
They stand shoulder to shoulder
Carrying the same heavy load
Bring peace to this troubled land
One man's eyes are full of sorrow
The other man's belly full of unbearable pain
They keep getting closer
Bring peace to this troubled land

I've got many screaming children
Ten million rows to hoe
Bring peace to this troubled land
Deader than an hammer
But I can't let go
Bring peace to this troubled land
The eyes of heaven are upon you
But so is the soul from down below
They'll cut off your fingers
To bring peace to this troubled land

Well you can stand up and holler
You can lay down and die
Bring peace to this troubled land
We can turn up our collars
And never even try
To bring peace to this troubled land
Beware of those who want to harm you
And drag you down to a lower game
Just know the truth is coming
To bring peace to this troubled land

I got a pain in my side
But I keep traveling on",Troubled Land
John Mellencamp,"Put your guns out on the table
Throw your bullets on the floor
This weary old house can't take it anymore
From the ovens in the kitchen
To the chains out in the dirt
Rope hanging in the bedroom
That's some of our dirty work

The distant sleeping shadows
That lie out in the yard
The wind that distorts the meanings
Of who we really are
Saluting of ourselves
As we pass by our mirrors
This show of phony adulation
Just masquerades all our fears

So we open up our eyes at midnight
See the setting of the sun
Foundation is crumbling
The inner structure's gone
Used up by corruption
And the passage of time
We hope we've got some fight left
Cause our children
Our children are dying

So we think that forgiveness
Is a God given right
And equality for all
Is just a waste of our time
With our nickel plated Jesus
Chained around are necks
Handing out verses of scripture
Like we wrote it down ourselves

Respect that we once had
Went up the water spout
Tried to keep it secret
But the secret was found out
Got to thinking high and mighty
Like everything was a lock
Some now say this house
Can be taken without a shot

So the hole gets dug deeper
With every wedding bell
And we sell each other down the road
Until there's nothing left to sell
And slowly but surely
We disappear without a trace
We point our fingers at each other
And say what the hell happened to this place
Without a shot
Without a shot
Without a shot",Without a Shot

John Mellencamp,"Seems like once upon a time ago
I was where I was supposed to be
My vision was true and my heart was too
There was no end to what I could dream

I walked like a hero into the setting sun
Everyone called out my name
Death to me was just a mystery
I was too busy raising up Cain

But nothing lasts forever
Your best efforts don't always pay
Sometimes you get sick and you don't get better
That's when life is short even in its longest days

So you pretend not to notice
That everything has changed
Way that you look and the friends you once had
So you keep on acting the same

Deep down in your soul
You know you, you got no flame
And who knows then which way to go
Life is short even in its longest days

All I got here is a rear view mirror
Reflections of where I've been
So you tell yourself I?ll be back up on top some day

Let's suppose I lived right over there
Let's suppose we shared a kiss
On a night like this

Let's suppose we went too far
In the back seat of your car
Let's suppose we fell in love
Like two turtle doves

And let's suppose we got engaged
Underneath that ol' Milky Way
And let's suppose we were complete
Wouldn't that be sweet

And let's suppose we found happiness
And built ourselves a nest
Let's supposed we had five kids
Like our grandparents did
And let's suppose our dreams came true
Just like they're supposed to do 
And let's suppose we spent the rest of our lives together

But let's suppose sometimes we'd fight
When things weren't going right
Let's suppose you got tired of me
And our family
And let's suppose that we went broke
And we both just gave up hope
And let's suppose you left in a huff
Because you didn't love me enough
And let's supposed you found another man
And hit me in the head with a frying pan
And let's suppose I wound up dead
Underneath the bed
What would happen to the kids
After all that we did
Let's suppose we both better just think it over

And that it's time for us to go

I'll call you back real soon
I bet that's your daughter

I bet they've torn that playground down
Where I first met you

John Mellencamp,"I knew this colorful woman once
She drank and had a roving eye
In the morning she was always mournful
She’d cry and apologize
But she’d always repeat herself
Find comfort with a stranger and sing
She never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

She had pictures of Cuban artists
And paintings from Rotterdam
Promises that she made
She never could stay true to them
She said she loved me so deeply
Then she’d spit in my face and scream
And she never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

She had the face of an angel
And a smile no one could deny
But the heart of a devil
Beat deep down in her inside
She spoke of judgment and forgiveness
Her other lovers didn't mean a thing
She never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

We parted in the middle of nowhere
I haven’t seen her since then
She always kept my mind busy
She made her lies seem like a hymn
Sometimes I wonder if I’d see her
If I would still recognize
Or just remember her as a dream
And respect her for the love she used to bring
If I could show her

John Mellencamp,"Sometimes there’s God in someone else’s eyes
Sometimes there’s God when you see the sun rise
Sometimes your work, only in vain
Sometimes there’s very little heartbreak and pain

Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s not

Sometimes there’s God and sometimes there’s just not
A little redemption would help us a lot
Sometimes there’s God in the palm of your hand
Somedays hard times will cover your land

Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s God
And sometimes there’s just not

Sometimes you pray for witness you can rise above
There’s judgment and destruction in the name of God
Can we find truth in all that we feel
Sometimes there’s God when sickness is healed

Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s God
Sometimes there’s not

We all need God when people don’t care
What we do to each other when there’s nobody else there
In the dark we promise God I’ll never do this again
Let the choices we’ve made be forgiven

John Mellencamp,"Just an old country boy, wearing my Osh-Kosh boots
Walked by the trailer factory, every day on my way to school
And early on in life, the only thing I wanted to do
Was buy me a trailer and move it down to Grandview

Got out of high school, got on at Whirpool
Bought me a car, two guitars and everything
Me and Patty were falling in love before the summer was through
I started thinking about trailers and high lots in Grandview

It was a scorching summer night, we just left the dairy bar
We was sitting out on Ridgeland Road in the front seat of my car
I said ""Patty, if you marry me, babe, I'll take good care of you
I'll buy a brand new trailer and move it down to Grandview""

She said ""Ah, your wedding song, it sounds real nice
And I could sure get off on sleeping with you at night
But I tell ya what, baby, you want me, here's what to do
I want a brick home like my mother's, ain't movin' down to Grandview,"" yeah
That's what she told me

There's been a lot of years, a lot of debts, a lot of pain
Our youngest baby's movin' out when she gets married next spring
When the bash is over, I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I got my trailer picked out, gonna move it down to Grandview

I got this 28 by 70, double-wide
We could slide it on in there, honey
We can chock those wheels real good
I want it settin' nice and level

Back it on in there boys
And don't get no mud on my front porch

John Mellencamp,"Everybody's laughin' at the Early Bird Café
I've been hidden there since yesterday, and I believe I've lost my way
Charlotte's there in organdy, and Billy's there in suede
There’s money in their pockets, and all the dues are paid
There's wine on every table, and food on every plate
Well I hope I get there pretty soon, before it gets too late

Someone asked me what time it was and I, told him it was now
He asked me just what that might mean, but time would not allow
So I gave away my watch to a passing businessman
Well I hope he understands it now, 'cause I've done the best I can
It was getting early, so I rushed away from there
With that ancient earth beneath my feet
And new dust in my hair

Well I ran on down the road a while, to the other side of town
My clothes were gettin' wrinkled, and my socks were fallin' down
But I could not stop to pull them up, for fear that I'd be late
So I kept on runnin' down the road until I saw the gate 
Of the Early Bird Cafe, glowin' golden like the sun
Everybody kept on singing, saying
""Come on in, we've just begun!

So I went right in, and I set right down, and I ordered up some wine
The talk was fast and clever, and the women all were fine
Charlotte asked me where I'd been with her jade and ivory eyes
I told her I'd been hung up, with some begger in disguise
Well she laughed like temple bells
Kissed me on the cheek and said
""You know it's hard to be alive sometimes
But it's easy
To be dead!""",Early Bird Cafe

And you might have to crawl even after you walk

Seen the longshot, win the race
Been knocked down by the slamming door
Picked myself up and came back for more

I wouldn't dream of letting them down

Got a call from my ex
And she's asking for more
I'm late with the rent
And the wolf's at the door
But that's gonna be
The furthest thing from my mind
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time

Got some pretty little women waiting on me
To shake up this sleepy old town
That's one job I take seriously
I wouldn't dream of letting them down

To get back on my feet
But I know I'll be alright

John Michael Montgomery,"Pick you up on Friday
About half past 8
Just time for a movie
You can't stay out late
I take you home
A little kiss at the door
Lately I'm thinkin'
I want a little more
Tell your daddy
I'm a hard working man
And after church on Sunday
I'm gonna ask for your hand
If he don't like it
Well that's just tough
I've got to have your full time love

Your undivided lovin'
Is what I need
Twenty four hours a day
Seven days a week
This part time romance
It just ain't enough

Sunday afternoon
Finally rolls around
I get in my old truck
And I drive downtown
Your daddy's waitin'
He says I got bad news
I've got to tell you son
She's too good for you
What he don't know
Is when the sun goes down
We're gonna slip out that window
And we'll leave this town
Drive to Memphis
Tie this thing up

John Michael Montgomery,"I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
But you can be sure I know my part
'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years

You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I'll make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear

Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
'Til death do us part

I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the wall
And when there's silver in your hair

You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as time turns the page
My love won't age at all

I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there

John Michael Montgomery,"If you've got faith
And you believe in what you're living for
You can stand your ground when the devil's at your door
And a little hope can help you when the road is getting rough
But there's nothing quite like life if you've got love

If you've got love you can move a mountain
A little bit further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn an ordinary picture into a priceless work of art
It's what you can do if you've got love in your heart

Now there's nothing like a real good friend
To tell your troubles to
But there's just so much a real good friend can do
'Cause it takes another's touch to chase the darkest blues away
If you've got love you've got what it takes

If you've got love you can move a mountain

John Michael Montgomery,"Darling I have a true confession
I ran into an old flame today
You wouldn't like the way our conversation
Turned to how we let each other slip away
I was reminded of a half forgotten feeling
One I shared with her so long ago
Since honesty is one thing we believe in
Let me tell you something you should know

Oh how she shines
Shines a light on you
And in that light I see
Just how much you mean to me
Oh how she shines

There was a time when she was all that mattered
Long before I gave my heart to you
But standing there only inches from her
She touched my hand and suddenly I knew
If there was a time I ever doubted
What I'd do if she walked through my door
Could I turn around and leave without her
With all my heart now I can say for sure

Oh how she shines
Shines a light on you
And in that light I see
Just how much you mean to me

John Michael Montgomery,"I don't have a lot to show
For these years of hard work
If you look at what I own
Still she's always telling me

To hold on to my dreams
Even when my hope is gone
Some may say that dreaming's just for fools
And there are times I thought that might be true

But she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon

When I look at the sky
But can't see through the clouds
She shows me the brightest stars
If I think of coming back

'Cause I'm having my doubts
She tells me I've come so far
Nothing in this world comes easily
But I can't lose with her right next to me

'Cause she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach

And says things with fancy frills
Don't turn her on

To make our house a home
She's steady as a rock
Standing by me
Even when I don't succeed
Lord I wish I could afford
The things she swears
She don't really need

She don't need a band to dance
It don't take wings for her fly

That you can tell at just a glance
When I take the notion
She seconds that emotion

She didn't say a thing
When we had to pawn the ring
To pay the rent
What I make in overtime
Stacked against the bills
Don't make a dent

And failed to be the man I oughta be

Of everything including me

John Michael Montgomery,"I got my first guitar when I was just a boy
I was playing the blues instead of playing with toys
Listening to the Opry and dreaming of the neon lights
So it was late to bed and early to rise
I worked the field all day and the crowd all night
My finger on the trigger and Nashville in my sights
I'm the real thing and I sing songs about real life

And I never heard a fiddle called a violin
Never really worried if I fit in
Country ain't what I sing it's what I am
This hat ain't something I wear for style
These boots have been around a while
Country ain't what I sing it's what I am

I learned to drive on a dirt road
Cruised the strip on rock and roll
And drove around on ""Miles and Miles of Texas""
And as I grew Daddy showed me now
To earn a living by the sweat of my brow
But he never made me follow in his steps
He said work hard and let the good Lord do the rest

And I never heard a fiddle called a violin
Never really worried if I fit in

My next breath could be my last

Someday's I'm in the saddle
Someday's I get thrown

That's a newly sharpened blade
That's a dagger to the heart
Of the promises we made

That's a chapter full of pain
A season full of rain
A dark and stormy night

Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end

Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you

Now and then
But you want to be
Just friends

You say you love me very much
And you'll always hold me dear

A flame without a fire
Can't warm me late at night

When I pick up my old guitar

I've buried comes bubblin' up
And once in a while, you feel close enough to touch

I miss you a little since you've been gone
A few little memories keep hangin' on
I miss you a little, I guess you could say
A little too much, a little too often
A little more every day

When I go by our old house
I pretend that you're still there
Waitin' for me on the porch
But there's just an empty chair

Wish I could see you just one more time
Before I drive away
So I could stop and go inside, and say

I miss you a little since you've been gone

Sometimes I feel her by my side,
Like she's watchin' over me,

I get a chill runnin' down my spine,
And that's all the proof I need,
That she fills my heart,
She fills my soul,

She is the half that makes me whole,
Well Sometimes we laugh,
And Sometimes we cry,
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why,

But no matter what she believes in me,
She's the closest thing to Heaven,
I'll ever see,
She always be an angel in my eyes,

John Michael Montgomery,"That house on the hill is long gone
Now she's living in a trailer with an Astroturf lawn
Got three little kids and no one to help
Trying to be Momma and Daddy all by herself
It's hard to hold down the fort when you're holdin' down a job
She'd rob Peter to pay Paul but he's already been robbed
She gets the food on the table and the clothes off the lines
She'd break down and cry but she doesn't have time

She got to be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothin' like she had planned
She's gonna be o.k. gonna find a way
Living in no man's land

Every now and then late at night
She thinks of how it would feel to hold someone tight
And there's a guy down at work he keeps callin' her up
But she ain't ready for none of that stuff
She's still sifting through the ashes of a love that's been and gone
Looking for a clue, trying to find out what went wrong
It ain't always easy, but she knows she's gotta try
Every time she looks into her babies' eyes

She got to be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothin' like she had planned
She's gonna be o.k. gonna find a way

John Michael Montgomery,"Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
When I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said to go ahead and make a bid on that

And I said
Hey pretty lady why don't you give me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine o' mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I got to have her she's a one of a kind
I'm going once, I'm goin' twice, I'm sold

To the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten, I know
She's got ruby red lips, blonde hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye.

Well the Auctioneer was going about a mile a minute
He was takin' bids and callin' them out loud
And I guess I was really gettin' in it
Cause I just shouted out above the crowd

And I said
Hey pretty lady why don't you give me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine o' mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine

I'm going once, I'm goin' twice, I'm sold

To the lady in the long black dress
Cause she won my heart it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blonde hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah, well we found love on the auction block
I throw my heart  away
And we love and laugh about the way we met that day

You can blind me with your light

You were holding me down
I could chase my wildest dreams

They held my world together
They kept me safe and sound
Right through the roughest weather
I guess I just lost touch
With the man in me you found
I was strong as I could be
When your arms were around

I've done everything
I said that I would
But you know somehow the good life
Don't feel like it should
So this ladder that I've climbed
I'd gladly back down
If I could just have one night

They kept me safe and sound

Long after your kiss has faded from my lips
Your love lingers on

It's still in the air, it's everywhere
It never disappears
It's surrounding me, like a melody
Reminding me you were here

Long after the glow has faded from the moonlight
And the stars have given way to greet the dawn
Long after the night has faded to sunlight
Your love lingers on

It's still in the air, it's everywhere
It never disappears
It's surrounding me, like a melody
Reminding me you were here

Long after your whisper has faded from my ears 
And the curtains are no longer drawn
Long after the passion fades into memories
Your love lingers on

It's still in the air, it's everywhere
It never disappears
It's surrounding me, like a melody
Reminding me you were here

Your love lingers on

John Michael Montgomery,"That morning sun was burnin' in my eyes
I could see a brand new day
And all the hurt and anger weighin' on my heart
Had begun to drift away
I saw it written on a church marquee as I drove into town
Said today's a new beginning friend
And I had to laugh out loud, 'cause there's no doubt

[Chorus]

I'm a brand new me
I've been shattered by the storm but I survived
I'm a brand new me
I found a revelation in the tears I cried
I opened up my eyes
Oh, what a change I see
I'm a brand new me

There's a warrior and a victim living deep
Inside all of us
We have to choose to fight or surrender
When the world beats us up
I know where my weakness lies, 
but I know it's a fight that I can win
I may get broken trying to get up
But I can't wait to start again, I'm gonna start again

[Chorus]
Days come and go, yeah they come 
and go like a road with no end
Hope fades but never dies
Just look at me catchin' my second wind

I'm a brand new me
I'm a brand new me",Brand New Me
John Michael Montgomery,"She didn't see me see her cryin'
As she sat there by the window
A southbound Greyhound leavin' town
The hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away and let that woman go
?Cause she came close to turnin' me around
Now I know she missed her mama
?Cause that's the kind of life she comes from
Ain't no kind of life I'm ever gonna have
She said she'd call me from the station
But I'll be gone before she gets there
And I'll see her every time I'm lookin' back

Heaven knows I ain't no angel
And I don't always do the right thing
And right now I know that she don't understand
But I'll sleep better knowin'
The only thing I ever loved
Is in that bus to Birmingham

Tonight I'll slip back in the shadows
And I'll sip a glass of whiskey
And I'll try to keep from whisperin' your name
But there's some highways I ain't drivin'
And there's some towns that I ain't lived in
And there's some times that I can't get out of the rain
And lord I can't bear to break
Another promise that I made her
So i made out like I wanted her to go
And I'm better off believin'
That she's better off without me
?cause I don't want her to see me do her wrong

Heaven knows I ain't no angel
And I don't always do the right thing
And right now I know that she don't understand

John Michael Montgomery,"My love for you has spread across
My every move, my every thought
Like a fire the wind has caught
As I begin
To give you all of who I am
Your every touch is my command
When once again it seems
I've loved you all I can

Even then my heart will pound
So loud the world will hear the sound
Of how I couldn't love you more
And even then
Each night will bring another day
Another chance for me to say
Your arms are all I'm living for and loving in
And even then the farthest star
Will find us anywhere we are
I will love you till the end
And even then

I won't know how to tell you this
But I will say with every kiss
No man has ever loved like this
Or will again
And when your auburn hair turns gray
And there are lines across your face
That map, each moment and each place
Our love has been

Even then my heart will pound
So loud the world will hear the sound
Of how I couldn't love you more
And even then

John Michael Montgomery,"Another night on this interstate
Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
Does it ever end
On my way to another show
Where I'll end up, I don't even know where I'm going
Or where I've been

Chorus
Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on that stage, and the curtain falls
I love it all

It's getting late, I think I'll lay it down
Then I'll wake up in some other town and I'll wander
To my hotel room
I'll walk around just a-wastin' time
Lookin' for a little peace of mind I bet I'll find it
On an ole barstool

Chorus

Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on that stage and the curtain falls
And the crowd wants to stay for one more song
I love it all

Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
I hope it never ends

John Michael Montgomery,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of his name never read her his word
Two non believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them what a sad little girl
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watched the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs every day!

Her first day at Sunday school
The teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of him
She said I know that man
There on that cross I don't know his name
But I know he got off
'Cause he was there in my old house
Held me close to his side
As I hid there behind our couch the night my parents died",The Little Girl

Well Dad, I've come to realize
I haven't said enough

You gave me back then
You know I've still got it now

Sometimes when the crowd is quiet
I'll bring it out again
And play the first song you taught me
Back when I was ten

Rollin' down the Rocky Mountains?
Movin' like the wind that sweeps the Kansas plains

A thousand miles of highway between your heart and mine

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for
I'll take you in my arms again
Feel your skin against my skin

As I cross the Mississippi
You're the river flowin' in me

Flat rock skippin', catfish hittin'.

Fun in the sun on the bass boat dockin'.

I was haulin' hay for your Daddy, an' you brought me a glass of tea.
To a farm boy from Oklahoma, you were small town Texas prize,
An' every young man's dream in cut-off jeans, with that Homecoming Queen smile.
You were makin' fun of my farmer's tan an' I was lettin' you.
An' fightin' bull in the July heat, tryin' to keep my cool.

An' the prairie wind sang while the dust devils danced.
It just got hotter as the summer passed.
An' that first kiss stole our breath away.
An' the breeze died down as our hearts surrendered.
The moonlight shattered as it crashed on the river.
We both knew we'd never be the same:
'Cause love changes everything.

I think your Daddy wondered but I know your Momma knew,
'Cause she pulled me aside one Friday night and said take good care of you.
We'd steal away after supper to our favorite place in the sand,
By the red water's edge where we'd hold hands while the sun melted into the land.
We lost more than sleep on one hot August night.
By mornin' we were seein' some things for the very first time.

An' the prairie wind sang while the dust devils danced.

As that weekend out in Joshua Tree,
When I got down on my knees.

An' I like lookin' back at all the things we've done.
But I love dreamin' of the years yet to come. 

Pictures of a life we've made together,
Memories of a love that just gets better with time.
So many good times,
There's no way I will forget.
Not now I'm thinkin' 'bout pictures,
We haven't taken yet.

Someday I'll walk our daughter down the aisle,
And every tear and every smile,
Will be captured in color.....

Pictures of a life we've made together,
Memories of a love that just gets better with time.
So many good times,
There's no way I will forget.
They got us thinkin' 'bout pictures,
We haven't taken yet.

John Michael Montgomery,"The ending of December 1943
Somewhere in the forest
The snow was three feet deep
Two allied soldiers walking
Trying not to freeze
Far from home on Christmas Eve

A cabin with the light on
Brought them to its door
A woman said, ""In my home
You can't bring in your war
So leave your rifles outside
Up against a tree
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve""

And they sat by the fire and they talked all night long
Sang Christmas hymns and showed pictures of home
In the middle of a great war it's so hard to believe
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve

Later in the evening, footsteps in the night
Two German soldiers freezing
The woman went outside
""You're welcome here in my home
But your guns will never be
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve""

The soldiers all were frightened
When they stood face to face
The woman said, ""You're brothers
Part of the human race
Tonight we're all just family
And we'll get down on our knees
And praise His name on Christmas Eve""

And they sat by the fire and the talked all night long
Sang Christmas hymns and showed pictures of home
In the middle of a great war, bitter enemies
Found peace on Earth on Christmas Eve

Early that next morning
They went their separate ways
Shook hands and hugged that woman
There on Christmas Day",December 1943

John Michael Montgomery,"O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
Oh, the night when Christ was born

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by the light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

[Chorus]

O night divine
O holy night
O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

[Chorus]

O night divine
O holy night
O night divine",O Holy Night
John Michael Montgomery,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

John Michael Montgomery,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and the children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

In the lane, snow is glistenin'
It's a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"", we'll say, ""No man
But you can do the job while you're in town""

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the older kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

John Michael Montgomery,"He really liked flannel with big bore arms
If you looked in his closet, it was all that you saw
He'd dress up on Sunday; a body looked neat
In a green leisure suit with wing tips on his feet

An' I hated the music he played in the car
It was hard to believe he called those people stars
They'd sing through their noses like they all had colds
I guess it's hard to be cool when you're forty years old

An' I was fifteen and real hip with long hair
An' I'd ask my Momma, ""Why's Daddy so square?""
An' I couldn't believe all that he didn't know
I guess it's hard to be cool when you're forty years old

The night I turned twenty, she came with the news
Scared half to death, an' didn't know what to do
I told her, ""I'm sorry, but it's not too late
There's a doctor I've heard of who fixes mistakes""

An' I thought he was workin', an' I was alone
But he was standin' behind me when I hung up the phone
He said, ""Son, there's a few things you don't know about
If you listen real close, we can figure this out""

""Cause I was eighteen and as wild as they came
When one night, a young girl told me the same thing
An' you wouldn't be here if she hadn't said no
You see, it's hard to be cool when you're twenty years old"" 

These days I like flannel an' old Levi jeans
An' I look at my young boy, who just turned fifteen
An' I know what he's thinkin', but it's OK, you know
You see it's hard to be cool when you're fifteen years old",Cool
John Michael Montgomery,"Happy Anniversary, baby
The years are rushing by us
You are more beautiful today
Than when we walked down the aisle

And I'm no good at this
But what I'm trying to say is
Having you stand beside me
Has made my life worthwhile

One true friend
Is what you've always been to me
One true friend
Is what I always wanna be

To have someone to love you
That's true happiness
May you live to be a 100
May I live one day less

There were times when we scraped by
A year or two and it was rough
But I love you more for what we went through
You never stopped believing in us

And I know I'm one of the lucky ones
I couldn't ask for anything more
'Cause you can have all the money you'll ever need
And spend your life looking for

Is what you've always been to me
One true friend
Is what I always wanna be

To have someone to love you
Now that's true happiness
May you live to be a 100
May I live one day less

I couldn't live without you
If I had to be alone
But I'll be waiting on the other side
When you find your way home

Is what you've always been to me

From my grandpa to my dad, on to me
All my life I've been shackled to a bottom
I never knew what it was like to be free

Leave it laying on the ground
It's time to make a change, I've caused enough pain
Lord, won't You help me break this chain

I give You thanks for giving me a reason
And a wife with forgiveness in her smile
Oh, I want this two hands to be rock steady
As she's handing me our new born baby child

John Michael Montgomery,"After drivin' all night Daddy stopped the car
Said, ""Wake up kids
Here we are
This is our new home""
Yeah
From that Oldsmobile all I could see
Was an ocean of fields out in front of me
It just rolled on, on and on
Daddy crossed the fence and he knelt down
Filled his hands with rich farmland and said
""This is good ground""

I had it all underneath my feet
There was room to grow
There was time to breathe
And dreams stretched high under summer skies
This is where I'm from
This is who I am
Down these roads I became a man
And they're callin' me
Where my roots run deep
Deep down
This is good ground

There it was an arrowhead
All I wanted to be, was Cherokee

I laid down my homemade bow for a brown-eyed girl

I learned to drive so we could ride around
We made the sweetest memories in it

John Michael Montgomery,"

Well I was just a kid maybe 2 or 3,

had a bad nightmare scared the life outa me,

momma came in to calm my fears,

when nothing she could do to would stop those tears,

she carried me down the stairs

to that living room and sat down in that chair,


[CHORUS]

and it rocked,

it made me feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed my soul,

and that's a feeling that I never forgot,

and it rocked

[CHORUS]


I was 17 and I fell for this girl,

as far as I could tell she was my only world,

I was confused about life,

in the dark about love,

I heard a lot of stories but I didn't know much,

we took a drive down to the river one night,

she told me when to stop then she kissed me just right,


[CHORUS]

and it rocked,

it made me feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed my soul,

that old chevy had brand new shocks,

but it rocked

[CHORUS]


After graduation I was workin odd jobs, changed a lot of oil in my uncles garage,

some friend of mine they were startin up a band,

I would sing for free so I was their man,

we were'nt that good and we seldom got paid,

but everbody knew when we took the stage,


[CHORUS]

it rocked,

it made us feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed our soul,

and that's a feeling that we never forgot,

and it rocked

[CHORUS]

John Michael Montgomery,"My Dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you
And finds you well
It's been dry
But they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same old same
In Johnsonville
Your stubborn old daddy
Ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know
He sends his love

And she goes on
In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh
Like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk
When I say, ""Mamma sends her best, y'all""

I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on
Waitin' on letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been lyin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mamma
And I showed her the ring
Man on the television
Said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright,
I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh
'Cause she calls me honey,
But they take it hard
'Cause I don't read the good parts

I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on
Waitin' on letters from home

Dear son, I know I ain't written
I'm Sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me
I might not have said it
So I'll say it now
""Son, You make me proud""

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause there's ain't nothin' funny
When a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes

I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on

To talk in riddles 'round the end
It took me a lot more livin'
To understand what he meant, when he said

I was born at daylight walkin' tall by seven
Graduated ten a.m. got saved by eleven
I took her hand it was straight up noon
Had three kids before two
They all grew and left in the afternoon

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night
I've lived a million moments in the time
It takes the sun to fade
And it feels like it all happened in a day

His eyes glistened as he talked
About his autumn afternoon
How they held each other in the chill of a silver moon
He got all chocked up when midnight fell
She squeezed his hand the clock struck twelve
She let go and he was all by himself

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night
I've lived a million moments in the time
It takes the sun to fade
And it feels like it all happened in a day

But oh, what a great day it was
We lived, we loved
And it all just sped up around the end

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night
I've lived a million moments in the time
It takes the sun to fade
And it feels like it all happened in a day

Time lies
And I feel like I lived my life in a day
In a day

John Michael Montgomery,"Mamma was the drummer in the band
But those sticks would turn
To switches if you made her mad
Daddy's amplifier doubled as his chair

They handed down the genes we were born to wear
That's how me and brother Edrow learned to sing
We caught that fever to go off and chase that dream
Barely old enough to sneak into the bars
We were the local weekend country music stars

We were rocked in the same old rocker
Fought over nothin' but it was somethin' back then
Don't always see eye to eye
But let's face it, we'll take it for each other on the chin
We were brothers when we started
We'll be brothers 'til the end

When we hit the road we went our separate ways
Singin' songs about the way that we were raised
Chasin' each other up and down those charts
We're still the local weekend country music stars

We were rocked in the same old rocker
Fought over nothin' but it was somethin' back then
Don't always see eye to eye
But let's face it, we'll take it for each other on the chin
We were brothers when we started
We'll be brothers 'til the end

We were rocked in the same old rocker
Fought over nothin' but it was somethin' back then

John Michael Montgomery,"When I get drunk and talk to God
I say, I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God, I tell Him why we're through
I tell Him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say I can't be alone, He'll say son you're on your own
'Cause when I talk to God, I tell Him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope He'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank Him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine all mine
I know He's a busy man, He'll help me if He can
So when I talk to God, I thank Him for the time

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope He'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God
Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God

Then you flew away from me
Winds whisper your name
Cause through the skies of my memory

Fly on and I will set you free
Fly on, fly on, sweet angel
Oh, and then you may fly back to me, fly on

It wasn't me that held you down
Just the voices in your soul
Now that you are freedom bound
I have no choice but to let you go

So fly on, fly on, sweet angel
Fly on and I will set you free
Fly on, fly on, sweet angel
Oh, and then you may fly back to me, fly on

Fly on, fly on, sweet angel

I guess I'm not as strong as I thought
When I see you lying there I worry about losing you
I used to think of only me but that was long ago
Now I find it hard to conceive life without you

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life
All alone at the end of the day
When the sun goes down I want you right here in my arms forever

Every little smile, every move you make
It's like a dagger to my heart, took my breath away
Now all I ask is that you be mine forever, forever

So think about what you're doing here
If you're anything less than sincere tell me now
And let yourself out the door
No harm, no foul, kill me now, save me all the pain
But if you feel the way I do stay, let me make love to you

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life
All alone at the end of the day
When the sun goes down I want you right here in my arms forever

A few more than I ought to, a few more than I used to

I'd lay my head down and try not to think
But I would'nt sleep a wink
Yeah, that's what I'd do

But if you stay I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna keep that promise that I made
'Cause deep inside I know that I'd be lost
If you ever went away

I'd probably spend a few more days out on the lake fishin'
Maybe even catch that big one, oh that'd be somethin'
Sit up on a big ol' stump watch the day fall down

Or probably just walk around, head on back to the house
Go through a door into a place I don't wanna be
Spend all night hangin' out with old memories

This little lady down in Texas, tight tank top and a tan
Rockin' three religion bridges, drinkin' beer in a can
She was too hot to two-step, I was too dumb just to leave her alone
But I made up my mind and I felt a fever comin' on
Kinda gettin' hotter

Yeah, my knuckles turned white, my neck turned red
My one good eye rode straight back in my head
Makes a Texas tornado seem like a cool breeze
I can feel it comin' over me mad cowboy disease, oh yeah

Well, I was one line away from scoring a win
But I was two shots shy of three sheets to the wind
Must've drank a hundred dollars
Sittin' there just tryin' to work up the nerve
Well one more here for my jitters then I'll stagger reaching over to her

I really couldn't walk that good
Oh, excuse me there kinda drippin' all over myself
Oh, Lordy, oh boy, here we go again

Talking like Mel Tillis I said what's your name
She said you ain't no player boy and I ain't no good for the game
You're kind of cute but when you're feelin' better give me a call
And with her black eye liner she wrote her number on my tremblin' palm

Yeah, my knees started shakin', I was breakin' out a sweat
Tryin' to memorize her number 'cause my hand was gettin' wet
I was showing the symptoms looking for a remedy
I can feel it coming over me, mad cowboy disease

Oh, I got the mad cowboy disease, little hoof in the mouth
Makes your tongue hand out all the way to the floor
Down on my hands and knees, beggin' like a hungry dog

I kinda like it down here, does anybody got a leash?

So tonight, can I make love with my shirt on?

You say our love has grown beyond the physical
And you tell me that you think I'm irresistible
The truth is I've been workin' out but I've still got a little ways to go
So tonight, can I make love with my shirt on?

Call it ego, insecurity
But you remember the man I used to be
Fearless, young and chiseled like a stone

The kids are sleepin', the blinds are open
Ooh, that moonlight sure is strong
So tonight, can I make love with my shirt on?

Now you say our love has grown beyond the physical
And you tell me that you think I'm irresistible

Till the last sand of time blows away,

In crowds there is no-one to turn to.
Down when you're high is a long way to fall,
And all the mistakes you won't learn through.

You wanted everyone to know your name.
Makin' sure you had the best
Just to stand out from the rest
And nothing any less could be the same.
People all around you could always be replaced,
So those you didn't need were pushed aside.
You would use them for a while
'Till their face went out of style.
Then say: ""Goodbye, and thank you for the ride!""
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, building castles in the sky,
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, make the end before you die.
Not for you a poor man's son,
Your dreams of fortune have begun
And once you're off the ground, you have to fly.
Now the girl with everything is feeling insecure,
Your smile is never all that it appears.
And the lady debonair
Who would never have a care
Fights harder every day to hide the tears. 
Time goes by, the spotlight fades,
You're standing in the dark.
A mystic left with no more spells to weave.
Like a lazy afternoon
That has passed you by too soon,
And all the things you had were make believe.
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, building castles in the sky,
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, make the end before you die.
Not for you a poor man's son,
Your dreams of fortune have begun,
And once you're off the ground, you have to fly.
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, building castles in the sky.
Plain Jane, chasing rainbows, make the end before you die.
Not for you a poor man's son,
Your dreams of fortune have begun,
And once you're off the ground,
Once you're off the ground,
Once you're off the ground, you have to fly.
And once you're off the ground, you have to fly.",Plain Jane
John Miles,"Down for the first time 
Back on your heel
Livin' on chances all the way
Fly like an angel 
Nothing is real
Let you down easy day by day

Running for cover
Nowhere to hide
Tell me you care at all
With your head burnt up inside

[Chorus]
Don't be a boy in a big man's world
Don't be a toy for a rich man's girl
You can work it out somehow
Don't see the end as a poor man's fool
Don't lose a friend for a broken rule
And when it's time to take your bow
Don't stop now

Lucky for someone takin' your turn
Leavin' you one more step behind
Laugh at the teacher 
You'll never learn
He'll never get into your mind

I've been spending too much time on my own
You're expecting me to change overnight 
Or you will hang up the phone
But on that day I needed, you found me
Now your walls are closin' in around me
Oh, I'd really love to stay 
But I know I'd feel much better alone
Won't you hold on, darlin', hold on?
Nights are so long
Now I know
Won't you hold on?
Can't you hold on?
I was so wrong
Don't let go
Now if things are not the same as before 
It isn't something I planned
You will never see the changes around you 
With your head in the sand
But you can't say it's only pretending
We're all dreaming of the happiest ending
And I'm losing everything that I need 
Because you don't understand
Won't you hold on, darlin', hold on?

It's a dream I know so well,
Always tried so hard to please me,
Only thing I know for sure,
I couldn't love you any more,

Could you belong to someone

You know how I feel inside,
You say my sad old days are over.

I had to go my way,
Show them I was older now,
And not some toy that they could play with,
Tell me how, everything I need today is
Lost only traces on faces,
That won't remember me now,
Yes I'm going back there somehow
Lost where my memory waits for me,
Home is where I belong,
But it's not the same when you're gone
With a lifetime passing by,
Every question asking why
Home, if I ever feel you're mine,
We will meet again in time,
Just realise that I'm old enough to know by now
That foolish dreams don't last forever,
Funny how, looking back I thought I'd never

Here in my heart,

John Miles,"I remember things about it, hoping every day you'll call.
This can't be, I expected to see, I am human after all.
Can't believe that you were fooling, always sounded so sincere,
I can't look back, as a matter of fact, I'm still sad that you're not here.
Someone scream, it's a terrible dream, it's all a big mistake.
Now I lost that thread deep inside of my head, it's so hard to never break,
Hard to never break.

I was blinded, yes I was blinded
And the tender touch that said so much doesn't need me now.
I was blinded, how I was blinded,
When I think about how far I've got to fall
It won't help that I was blinded by it all.

Walked in with my eyes wide open, seeing what I want to see,
And I'm not so strong so I did it all wrong, now the one that hurts is me.
Can I learn to live without you, someone better tell me how.
It's understood, we were always so good, but it doesn't help me now.
Every one's there all pretending to care with a different point of view,
If a love's that real, then they'll know how it feels, and there's nothing I can do,
Nothing I can do.

And the tender touch that said so much doesn't need me now.

They said you cheated on me last night
You know I didn't believe it till I saw it in your eyes
I could tell, I could see
That you were trying to make a fool out of me
You know I never ever thought that you would ever tell me lies

I don't believe you and the things that you say
A little bit of truth goes a long long way
I really need some honesty tonight
I love you, honey, but it just ain't right

Don't you lie to me
Don't tell me stories that my heart just won't believe

Now look here, and beware
'Cause you can't believe that you don't care
I'm just looking for a lover who'll return some love to me
Look at me, and be straight
You see I haven't got the time to wait
Till you get yourself together and decide just what you mean

Why don't you tell me how you really feel?
A little bit of time and the wounds will heal
I really need some honesty tonight
I love you, honey, but this just ain't right

I just live to see her again
Sad, but I can't let it show

If only I could turn away

So maybe I'll never be right

Reason goes over my head
Try, but there's nowhere to run
I cannot believe what she said
Hide from the things that she's done
I don't know how long I can stay
Too many bridges to mend
I know I must face it one day
How long I'm gonna pretend? 
Hard as I try, all those things I'm hearing
Please don't let me hear them now
Understand why I could dry my tears
And try to work it out somehow

But when it's gone and she's saying so long
It's just a short conversation.

Bye bye I'll really miss you honey,
Bye bye I'll see your next sunny day"".

What can you say when it's slipping away
And there is no explanation?
You say ""My my where is all the money,
My my can I see you honey
My my I've had my last sunny day"".

John Miller,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

John Minton,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",Birdie

John Modlin,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her

Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

And that is why the poets always write
If there's a new moon bright above

John Newman,"Living in a broken home alone
16 weeks since you've been gone
As time goes by there's no pieces left
No memories of you & me

To shut out feeling lonely; I get out of my head
Lost everything around me
Not dealing with it well
To shut out feeling lonely; I get out of my head
Why would you want to love somebody when love hurts in the end?

Free to see the world now as my own
Sleep with any woman that I want
But anytime anyone gets close
Breaks through my mind, what I have lost

To shut out feeling lonely; I get out of my head
Lost everything around me
Not dealing with it well
To shut out feeling lonely; I get out of my head
Why would you want to love somebody when love hurts in the end?

You called to say you're missing me, but never ask how I feel
I'm beaten, I'm broke
I'm out of my mind, but learning to get on by fine

To shut out being lonely; I get out of my head
Lost everything around me
Not dealing with it well
To shut out being lonely; I get out of my head
Why would you want to love somebody when love hurts in the end?",Out of My Head

John Nicol,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

John Nicol,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

I would be, caught in the undertow

John O'Dreams,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",The Birds (Of Beslan)

Amazed by the number of times we've all sinned
And the countless enemies that should've been friends, oh

The people stare but I don't care,
My flesh is cold against my bones,
And Cheryl's going home.

Can you hear me shouting in the rain?
Is there a way to stop the train?
I've got some reasons to explain,
About the way I was today,
The whistle moans and I'm alone,

She's going home tonight ok,
I'm running down the train tracks,
Lost because she's gone away oh yeah,
Cheryl baby I love you,
And all the things you've ever done for me that's true.
Then I see that look in your eyes,

You're going away,

You have been for me a strength,
in times of weakness. 

Thank You for Your peace, 
that means all the world to me,
You have brought me out so many times,
I thank You. 

Verse 3:
How you brought me off the street,
gave Samuel Street back to me ,
I want to take the time to say thank You. 

Now my faith is on fire,
haters are calling me a liar,
I want to take the time to say thank You. 

Verse 4:
For the joy that You have given me,
for the love I thought I'd never see,
I just want to say thank You, Jesus. 

For the strenthg to fight my enemies
I thought I couldn't now I know I can,
I just want to say thank You, Jesus.

John P. Kee,"Verse 1:
Your ways are higher than ours,
not by strength, nor by power,
but by Your spirit and predestined plan.
You preserve Your people with Your mighty hand,
higher than the mountain peak;
oh Lord, You mean more than anything. 

Verse 2:
From Your image we were made,
by Your blood we all are saved,
and not by anything that we have done,
but by the blood that was shed from Your only Son.
Reconciled and I shall ever cling,
oh Lord, You mean more than anything. 

Chorus:
I shall lift my hands to Thee,
You've spoken with clarity,
You've removed the mystery, 
and in the Word of God,
I'm satisfied with Thee;

John P. Kee,"I've been through so many valleys
I've felt the strain of strife
Trying to overtake my life

But you were there to comfort me
And give me life renewed
He's able to see me through

Lord, Your abilities strengthens my faith and comforts me
Most of all, The Lord won't leave me
Most of all, He's able to keep me
Most of all, He's able to see me through

This year has been a very trying one
In August I lost my dad
One of the very best friends I had

But during that time You were there
To exemplify Your love and care
He's able to see me through

Whatever your trials may be
You've conquered adversity
Jesus died that we might
Share abundant life

He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able

He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able to see you through

He's able to see, yes he is
He's able to see, yes
He's able to see me through

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

John Patitucci,"Now
All my life I've waited
And I've been afraid and
I wondered If I'd find
Someone to share my life

Every day I prayed and
Every night I searched in
Every stranger's eyes
For some kind of sign

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you 
A million empty days, too much time and space
Every tear I cried, every lonely night 
I was waiting for you

Now here you are
And my world is, my world is so beautiful
Now here you are
And my life is, and my life is so wonderful
Now

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has, like no one ever has

John Patitucci,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray

Yea thanks for the lighter
Anybody smoke here?
Aight, that's more for me you punk
Motherfuckers
Look, check it out, look

[verse 1]
Everybody, he was born to hustle
It's a very thin line between the boss
And the muscle
We foot soldiers
Face first in the trenches
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these
Hoes and weight bitches
Hell's kitchen, raw kitchen
Never crying and bitching and settling
For less
Metal in your chest, take a final breath
Revolutionary
It's x-man the mercenary
Carry a .44 desert eagle
Feeding the people even if it ain't legal
Low-riding in the regal or the cadillac
Money stacked probably give yo ass a
Heart attack
Purchased your last cd I want my money
Back
You see the battle ima see you in the
Street
Survival of the first to draw the heaters
And the cannons
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing

[chorus 2x]
Crack a bottle for your hard time
It's dedicated to my soldiers on the
Front line
This one's for all of us
Thinking bout your casualties
Learn from mistakes, protect your family
Cause it's the year 2000

[verse 2]
Everybody wannabe king
Fuck everything
All this shit is bout to me mine
I hear it all the time
Live your life for the day
Easier to burn than papier-mache
Started with dre
Graduate to radioplay
I still ain't satisfied
Bout to blast off worldwide
Get in line check the politics
Ever wonder why only certain
Motherfuckers get rich
Ain't this a bitch
Barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Having violent stand-offs with the police
North hollywood beef
Grinding my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes
Bleed
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here
Besides us
Catch a flatline

[chorus 2x]

[verse 3]
I was one that never begged for nothing
Me and my homies build penitentiary
Huff-it
Running your mouth like a bitch cause you
All on my dick
What is he dogg pound now? is he still
With tha liks?
Is he rich? is xzibit a crip? this is
Business stay the fuck out of my family shit
A grown man, the back of my hand is what
You will see
If the x-fives make you believe
You check the sound scan I do the math
Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath
A bloodbath, make xzibit have a good laugh
It's going down, hit the ground like a
Plane crash
You lil fags ain't prepared for the x-man
Scared and desperate
Young and restless
There is no guest list
Move to the back of the line
Yo it's my time, prime time only where the
Beats and the rhyme shine

All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

But I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself
""Where is she?""
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says
Just forget about her

Strangely enough
I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by - oh well

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Oh so many times I tried to say those things I felt inside.
But words would hide from me,
But there will come a time, when these words I say in rhyme,
Will hold you in a whisper and that whisper will be mine,
So if you listen you will hear a laughing smile, a silent tear,
And when you hear these words you'll know it is true,

Though by tomorrow you're gone

I'll still possess

The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

But today, yes sir, they're shining and new
Oh, what a change has come to me
I've been dusted off the shelf
I am not myself
What a different world I view

I see a new sun up in a new sky
And my whole horizon has reached a new high
Yesterday my heart sang a blue song
But today hear it hum a cheery new song

I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

But should the bough break you can take my hand

Can hurt worse than any ache you feel
Forcing words into that tune you're humming
Which did I make up and which were real

I know that really letting go
In spite of falling to and fro
It's not no simple thing
Not an ordinary stunt to try
But I can see it's on your mind
And whatever you will find
Whatever hope will bring
I can see it in your eye
Will bring release

",How About Now?
John Popper,"What if I could tell the world I see you
What if I could make them understand
And if I could show those fools they need you
It wouldn't change the fact that you need them

And if you find yourself in great transition
And you think perhaps you've lost your way
On the edge and fragile your position
Then there's only one thing I can say

Welcome home
Yeah, cause its your home

If a tree falls and nobody's listening
If a party's thrown and no one shows
And you dream about what you are missing
When the wind in February blows

Welcome home
Cause its your home

If you hide amongst the darkness
Let me offer you a light
And if you stay, by the light of day
Fearful when the sun goes down
Come out with me tonight

What if I could make the world beseech you
What if I could make you understand
That from the highest branch no one could reach you
But should the bough break you can take my hand

Looking for the signs that April's coming
Can hurt worse than any ache you feel
Forcing words into that tune you're humming
Which did I make up and which were real

I know that really letting go
In spite of falling to and fro
It's not no simple thing
Not an ordinary stunt to try
But I can see it's on your mind
And whatever you will find
Whatever hope will bring
I can see it in your eye
Will bring release
Perhaps a modicum of peace
Perchance to dream
Perchance to bust out at the seam
And the mere chance
Sustains as bravely I advance
But it don't matter what I do
Without some one to bring it to

Welcome home
Come home
Make it home
Go home
Leave home
And find a home
Build a home
And feel at home
Cause it's your home
",Love for Free
John Popper,"Move on
And shuffle off
Winter's gift is a burning cough

Once a stranger
Always a friend
To the cold and the odd stare
And the danger
Should he ever open his mouth

And so he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time

Some day he thinks he may fool everyone
And they'll give and let him live in the bright hot sun

And so he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time

Doorways and hope keep him warm
Strangely calm before the storm
Quite sure that he will be free
To speak of voices he can't quite see
They tell him more than he'd ever wished to know

And so he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time

And when the bugle sound
Knocks the mountains down
His work will be done
Whispers in his ear he keeps him clear
For the angels when they come

So he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time

Till he assumes his place
Then he'll see the face of God, of God
The ruthless King of Kings
Who keeps telling him things
That still seem odd

So he bides his time
Yes, he bides his time
Move on

John Popper,"I use love like fuel
The pain it drives my engine
It's a source without renewal
Without environmental protection

I said I'll strip mine into your heart
I drill deep and sap you dry
Break you down and sell the parts
For what money just can't buy

Because I use love like fuel
The pain it drives my engine
I use love like fuel
I use love like fuel

I need to feel rejection
To feel anything at all
It grants me worldwide connection
With all things great and small

The anguish gives me vision
I can't say how long it lasts
But the more I have collisions
The more I want to drive fast

Because I use love like fuel
The pain it drives my engine
I use love like fuel
I use love like fuel

Send me up for murder
And I'd feel like I was free
Because I never wanted to hurt her
But it came so easily

Unaware of what I'm taking
I can effortlessly crush
It's only when our hearts are breaking
That I'm nourished by the rush

'Cause I use love like fuel
The pain it drives my engine
I use love like fuel
I use love like fuel
Ooh love like fuel
I use love like fuel",Miserable Bastard
John Popper,"And what about the times
Now I'm grabbing out at breaking glass
An attempt to find a memory
That makes it seem glorious or at least okay

But all I have is me
In a razor caught off guard as you brush by
The alarm wakes me out of bed
And the dream I was just having simply fades away

And blindly do I see
At the sunlight I am freezing
And as I start to come around, I want to fall back to the ground
Roll over and make sense again

But it's too late I am awake
And it's sensation, I can't fake as I try my best to pretend
But once you wake up
You just can't fall back asleep anymore

I know it isn't fair
But once you're aware
You can back track all you want
You can mourn for what's gone
But you're up either way
You better deal with your day

I remember I was tired
In fact I still have some sleep in my eyes
So I got all warm and safe and numb
Figured I'd lie down and rest a while

Next thing came the morning
And you're shaking me and telling me to rise
And I would tell you anything
To stall and make you think or smile or cry

You see all I need is you
And then I start to understand what love does
Now there's so much that I can give
And I finally want to live

You know before I just didn't really ever care
And I'll do more than hold on
I want to celebrate the dawn
I don't ever want to go back to sleep I swear
But once you wake up
You can't just fall back to sleep anymore

I know it isn't fair
But once you're aware
You can backtrack all you want
You can mourn for what's gone
But you're up either way
You better deal with your day",Once You Wake Up
John Popper,"Tell me your will
And it shall be done
Because you need a disciple
And I am one

And I believe
Because I do
Before I learned a thing
I knew you

A disciple's role is hard because
Though he may never know for sure
He gives his faith and risks the danger
But then he's not alone anymore

But tell me please
I am down upon my knees
When they assign you rules
Is this wisdom made for fools

You're with me when I start to play
I will gladly pray if you preferred
If given the sacred word
Till then I'll keep loving you in the way
I do when I see your face in her
Then I know for sure

For every miracle that you have made me
She's the one that makes them real
I have to love what is beyond me
I'll never learn as much as I feel
But for a time I can understand
When she and I
I am at your command

You're with me when I start to play
I will gladly pray if you preferred
If given the sacred word
Till then I'll keep loving you in the way
I do when I see your face in her
Then I know for sure

By every faith that I've invested
By every lightning bolt and scar
By every name that you've been contested
You are the sum of what we are

When she's with me
We both can see
And the world is love
I can't drink in enough

You're with me when I start to play
I will gladly pray if you preferred
You give me the sacred word
Till then I'll keep loving you in the way
I do when I see your face in her
Then I know for sure

You're with me when I start to play
I will gladly ahhhh
You give me the sacred word
Till then I'll keep loving you in the way
I do when I see your face in her
Then I know for sure

Tell me you have again
She's a miracle
Amen

John Popper,"Brown eyes that know you
Furious long black hair
In on some joke you won't admit
But she's keeping you aware

Tender smile, she's nervous
She sees you looking too
But only as she starts to want to
Show it all to you

And there's fire in her kiss
And it all comes down to this
With an aching
That insists on bliss

Passionate embrace
That look upon her face
And there's fire in her kiss
There's fire in her kiss

Subtle, sweet and swirling
The dance of giving eyes
That tell you to come closer
Though everybody tries

To drink her lips like nectar
On the mind of all that see
And I'm only here to tell you
Couldn't believe she was kissing me

Fire in her kiss
And it all comes down to this
With an aching
That insists on bliss

Passionate embrace
That look up on her face
And the fire in her kiss
There's fire in her kiss

Slow and wet and always moving
Lazy circling caress
Breathe each other in and out
'Til we are each other's breath

Tasting in that feeling
Connection in the yearn
That sends both of us reeling
As her lips begin to burn

And there's fire in her kiss
And it all comes down to this
With an aching
That insists on bliss

Passionate embrace
That look upon her face
There's fire in her kiss
There's fire in her kiss

John Popper,"The thick and smoky night
Abounds around us
Up to the same old game
To tame the aching beast without

There's nothing we can't do or take
Our appetite astounds us
Dawn, the only clock I rock
Until I tremble and pass out

And through the morning reverie
We slip away and go to sleep
But I lay restless and awake
Fearful only of the chance I didn't take

The comedy, I don't regret
But instead forget to mention
A thousand times of taste and touch
Slightly slated not to be

Mean to make a mockery
I imply my apt intention
The devil in the details wails
For one day want of breaking free

And through the morning reverie
We slip away and go to sleep
But I lay restless and awake
Fearful only of the chance I didn't take

All fires rage with the sun going down
The ashes fall by morning
Landing safely on the ground

All fires rage with the sun going down
The ashes fall by morning
Landing safely on the ground

Make no mistake, I mean to take
Every chance that comes my way
By every turn, I've left to burn
Still another will be sought

By that thing that rings the tuning fork
For the force of night and day
The sun shines as I slumber
To earn the evening I have wrought

And through the morning reverie
We slip away and go to sleep
But I lay restless and awake
Fearful only of the chance I didn't take
And through the morning reverie
We slip away, slip away

John Popper,"Show me how a prison gets made
Slick walls enclosing hope
Show me the gates to paradise
Could be the same building
Depending which way you walk
Show me which way to go

Show me that picture
Of that time in that place
Show me when I was really happy
And everything was perfect

Show me that memory, always
Paints a rosy picture
You only show me how you show me
And it shows

Show me what I'm dying to see
Show it to me eagerly
I ain't from Missouri, I'm from misery
So show me how to set me free

Show the writing on the wall
Show the calm before the squall
Show me when I move in close
How your eyes begin to close

Show me the door, show me the street
Show me the endings incomplete
Show to me the sun and sea
There's so much that you show to me

""Mm-hm"" 
""Gee, it must be great riding with him""
""Is he picking you up after school today?""
""Mm-mm""
""By the way, where did you meet him?""
 
""I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me 
You get the picture
""Yes, we see""
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack
 
My folks were always putting him down
They said he came from the wrong side of town
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack
 
One day my dad said find someone new
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack
 
Do do
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night,
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,
I'll never know  Look out! Look out! Look out!
 
I felt so helpless, what could I do
Remembering all the things we'd been through?
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

On a warm summer night
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons

Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me that she was trying to blame

On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring

Well, I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A June bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second to long

Well, I started the engine
And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse

I ran across a looking glass
Reflecting moments remaining in a burned out light
Tragic magic prayers of passion
Stay the same through changing fashions
They freeze my mind like water on a winter's night

Out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof
Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
Photographs show the laughs
Recorded in between the bad times
Happy sailors dancing on a sinking ship
Cloudy skies and dead fruit flies
Waving goodbye with tears in my eyes
Well, sure I made it but ya know it was as hell of a trip
Spent most of my youth
Out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof
Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes

John Prine,"I got a friend in Fremont
He sells used cars, ya know
Well, he calls me up twice a year
Just ask me how'd it go
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
Actually everything is just about the same

I met a girl from Venus, and her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did said ""How was it, kid?""
She was politely told
""Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same.""

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
Cause actually all them dogs is just about the same

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast
And up the sky and Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
Cause actually all them gods is just about the same
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
Cause actually everything is just about the same

I don't talk much I'm a quiet man

Don't pin your blues on me

John Prine,"While digesting Reader's Digest in the back of a dirty book store
A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me
""If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free""
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said

""But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war""
""Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore""

John Prine,"While walking out, one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we held our show

I heard a little mission band
Playing with all their might
I gave my soul to Jesus
And left the show that night

The day will soon be over
And evening will begone
No more gems to be gathered
So let us all press on

When Jesus comes to claim us
And says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining
No longer in the rough

John Prine,"While out sailing on the ocean
While out sailing on the sea
I bumped into the Saviour
And He said pardon me
I said Jesus you look tired
He said Jesus so do you
Sit down son
Cause I got some fat to chew

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to

Well he spoke to me of morality
Starvation, pain and sin
Matter of fact the whole dang time
I only got a few words in
But I won't squack
Let 'em talk
Hell it's been a long long time
And any friend that's been turned down
Is bound to be a friend of mine

[Chorus]

Now we sat there for an hour or two
Just eatin' that Gospel pie
When around the bend come a terrible wind
And lightning lit the sky
He said so long son I gotta run
Appreciate you listening to me
And I believe I heard him sing these words
As he skipped out across the sea

There was a note in the frying pan
It said fix your own supper babe

The way she used to cuss and moan
And if I ever go out and get married again
I'll never leave my wife at home

And I commenced a carryin' on

John Prine,"I knew a girl who was almost a lady
She had a way with all the men in her life
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty
And she was born on the fourth of July

Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer
And she worked in a juke box saloon
And she spent all the money that I give her
Just to see the old man in the moon

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings
To the drive-in on Route 41
And it was there that I first suspected
That she was doin' what she'd already done

She said, ""Johnny won't you get me some popcorn""
And she knew I had to walk pretty far
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight
She hopped into a foreign sports car

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Well you know I could have beat up that fellow
But it was her that had hopped into his car
Many times I'd fought to protect her
But this time she was goin' too far

Now some folks they call me a coward
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night
But I'd rather have names thrown at me
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Now she writes all the fellows love letters
Saying ""Greetings, come and see me real soon""
And they go and line up in the barroom
And spend the night in that sick woman's room

But sometimes I get awful lonesome
And I wish she was my girl instead
But she won't let me live with her
And she makes me live in my head

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise",The Great Compromise

They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years
To get those souvenirs

Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'

John Prine,"Robert was a sailor
For the best years of his life
His captain was his mother
And the ocean was his wife
Only fresh out of the cradle
Life's one and only spring
He was sworn to do his duty
And got blood on his high school ring

And it's hello California
Hello Dad and Mom
Ship ahoy
Your baby boy
Is home from Vietnam
Don't you ask me any questions
'Bout the medals on my chest
Take the star out of the window
And let my conscience take a rest
Now he sailed across the ocean
To the old far eastern war
And it was foreign to his body
It was foreign to his shore
So he traded in the present
For the better times he'd seen
And made an oriental waitress
His own home comin' queen

From the torch singer's song
And the sweat was floodin' her eyes
The catwalk squeaked
'Neath the bartender's feet
And the smoke was too heavy to rise

She sang of the love that I left her
And of the woman that she'll never be
Made me feel like the buck and a quarter
That I paid 'em to listen and see
I paid 'em to listen and see
I was born down in Kansas
'Neath the October sky
Work the day shift from seven to three
And the only relief that I receive
Is nearer my God to Thee
She constantly throws me off timing
Leaves me standing both naked and bare
Makes me feel like the Sunday funnies
After everything's gone off the air
Everything's gone off the air
I picked through the ashes
Of the torch singer's song
And I ordered my money a round
For whiskey and pain
Both taste the same
During the time they go down

The more I drink, the less I feel blue
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool

[Incomprehensible]

If this date were to be our last, I'd never sit down this glass
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you
You've left my heart a vacant lot, I'll fill it with another shot

John Prine,"Last night I saw an accident
On the corner of Third and Green
Two cars collided and I got excited
Just being part of that scene
It was Mrs. Tom Walker and her beautiful daughter
Pamela, was driving the car
They got hit by a man in a lite blue sedan
Who had obviously been to a bar

[Chorus:]
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority

It was a four way stop dilemma
We all arrived the same time
I yielded to the man to the right of me
And he yielded it right back to mine
Well, the yield went around and around and around
Till Pamela finally tried
Just then the man in the light blue sedan
Hit Pamela's passenger side

[Chorus:]

Pamela hit her head on the mirror
Mrs Walker got a bump on the knee
The man hit himself in the face and said
""Why does this happen to me?""
The neighbors came out
And they gathered about
Saying ""Hey! who hit who anyway?""
And the police arrived at a quarter to five
And pronounced all the victims ""Okay""

John Prine,"Feelings are strange
Especially when they come true
And I had a feeling
You'd be leaving soon

Blue umbrella
Rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain
While the rain
Makes up my mind

Well, my feet are wet
From thinking this thing over
And it's been so long
Since I felt the warm sunshine

Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you any more
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other four.

Day time
Makes me wonder why you left me
Night time
Makes me wonder what I said

Next time
Are the words I'd like to plan on
But, last time
Was the only thing you said.

John Prine,"It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good
We has turkey and pistols carved out of wood

Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
I'm rollin' my sweetheart
I'm flowin' by God

Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
And she's sweeter than saccharine at a drug store sale

And hammered nails in planks

John Prine,"I wish, I hope, I wonder
Where you're at sometimes
Is your back against the wall?
Or just across the line
Have you been standing in the rain
Reciting nursery rhymes?
Trying to recall
Some long lost kind of peace of mind
Peace of mind
Try spending the night sometime
All alone in a frozen room
Afterneath you've lain
Your Saddle in the rain

I dreamed they locked God up
Down in my basement
And he waited there for me
To have this accident
So he could drink my wine
And eat me like a sacrament
And I just stood there like I do
Then I came and went
I came and went
Like a bird in a foreign sky
Couldn't even say good bye
Or come and share the pain
My Saddle's in the rain

I saw a friend who doesn't know
If I'm his friend just yet
His eyes and mouth were widely open
And his jaw was set
Like he'd fell off a cliff
And hadn't hit the bottom yet
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me
Without a net
Without a net
I had him up to the house one time
And we was having a real good time
Then he went and lain
His Saddle in the rain

In a laundromat not too far
From the Alamo
Sits a girl who stole my records
Very long ago
And she wishes, wants and washes
Out those dirty clothes
As she shuts her eyes and dreams
About her one eyed Joe
One eyed Joe
Car parked on a dirty road
Heaven knows the load she pulled
Couldn't take the strain

John Prine,"It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished 'em well
You could see that pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle.
And the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell,
""see'est la vie,""
-say the old folks
It goes to show that you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment
With a two room roebuck sale
The coolerator was filled
With t.v. dinners and ginger ale
But when pierre found work,
The little money comin' worked out well
""see'est la vie,""
-say the old folks
It goes to show that you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
""see'est la vie,""
-say the old folks
It goes to show that you never can tell

They bought a souped up jitney
'twas a cherry in fifty-three
They drove it down to new orleans
To celebrate their anniversary.
It was there where pierre was wedded
To the lovely mademoiselle,

John Prine,"There was a time
When lonely men would wander
Through this land
Rolling aimlessly along
So many times
I've heard of their sad story
Written in the words
Of dead men's songs.

Down through the years
Many men have yearned
For freedom
Some found it
Only on the open road
So many tears of blood
Have fell around us
'cause you can't always do what you are told.

Please tell me where
Have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down
By the rusty railroad track
Could it be that time
Has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.

Last Sunday night
I wrote a letter
To my loved one
I signed my name
And knew I'd stayed away
Too long
There was a time
When my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing
This hobo song.

It's a ukulele Honolulu sunset
Listen to the grass skirts sway
Drinking rum from a pineapple
Out on Honolulu Bay
The steel guitars all playing
While she's talking with her hands
Gimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polka
Words I understand Hey!

[Chorus]

Well, I boughta lota junka with my moolah
And sent it to the folks back home
I never had the chance to dance the hula
Well, I guess I should have known
When you start talking to the sweet wahini
Walking in the pale moonlight
Ohka noka whatta setta knocka-rocka-sis-boom-boccas
Hope I said it right Oh!

John Prine,"He stumbled through the alley with his long coat on
Nothing but a bottle in his hand
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone
Wondering what had happened to her man

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Nobody ever understands
All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.

When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine
With the kind of love no human heart can fake
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake

[Chorus]

If I should live to a ripe old age
The only lesson I may ever learn
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love
Unless you are willing to get burned

[Chorus]

All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.","Love, Love, Love"
John Prine,"Barley malts and does eat oats and little girls are lively
And your liveliness has left me in a brew
So I'm sitting here just drinking beer
'Cause there's nothing else to do
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

We were so happy, honey when we were together
Why we should have won a ribbon colored blue
But those Rocky Mountain waters came between us
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

[Chorus:]
So I'm living in the land of sky blue waters
And I'm grabbing all the gusto up, it's true
Well, you only go around once in life, they say
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you

These teardrops that I'm crying are the champagne of bottled tears,
And I must admit that I've shed one or two,
But when good friends get together well they always tip a few
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

[Chorus]

So put me in a cool place, for I'm the King of Beers
Forty to forty-five degrees will do
And if you must play that jukebox, let it be low and now
'Cause when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

So if you got the time, we got the tears
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.",Out of Love
John Prine,"If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me

What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And watch her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the use to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
But they'll never, never take her love from me

Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'll never, never take her love from me

No, they'll never, never take her love from me",They'll Never Take Her Love from Me

Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray

Lydia
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.

Chorus:
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby,
Like sunshine feeding daisies,
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.

Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:

There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.

Hot love, cold love, no love at all.
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.
Donald and lydia made love that night.

(spoken:)

The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,

John Prine,"We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown

And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean war
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

Chorus:
Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, ""Hello in there, hello""

Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the back door screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if asks ""What's new?""
""Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do""

And spot some hollow ancient eyes

Seem like total silence was the only friend I had
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won

That I was havin' no fun

But fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun

Last time I checked my bankroll,
It was gettin' thin
Sometimes it seems like the bottom
Is the only place I've been
I Chased a rainbow down a one-way street dead end
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen

[Chorus]

Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
Tryin' to get away
From all the ears inside my walls
I dreamed the police heard
Everything I thought... what then?
Well I went to court
And the judge's name was Hoffman

Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while

Changing all them diapers polish all that chrome.

Running, laughing back and forth the kid with two first names
Stranger in the closet, lock the diary
The past is running faster singing harmony
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me
""God bless this kitchen"" said the knick-knack shelf
""The dinner's almost ready Go and wash yourself""

Everything's okay
Why just before last Christmas
My baby went away

Across the sea to an island
While the bridges brightly burn
So far away from my land
The valley of the unconcerned

I was walking down the road, man
Just looking at my shoes
When God sent me an angel
Just to chase away my blues

I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds
Just flying through the sky
And they seemed to form a teardrop
From a black haired angel's eye

That tear fell all around me
And it washed my sins away
Now everything is cool
Everything's okay

Now she tells her problems to therapy groups

I'm sitting on the front steps drinking orange crush
Wondering if it's possible if I could still blush

Sleeps in the river by the railroad tracks
He waits for the whistle on the train to scream
So he can close his eyes and begin to dream

With his mind on a bus that goes all over town
Looking at the babies and the factories
And listening to the music of Mister Squeeze

He finds a piece of a puzzle
That he missed in his soul

Just to see where these feelings led
If I was the heart and you were the head?

My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including tax.

So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?

One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".

Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas presents
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential customers.
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital Washington, D.C.,
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune 
Then my little brother will be happy.
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.

Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing. 
It was a like aqua blue. 
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards. 
The model was called Kentucky Blue 
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.
First year so I didn't know how to play it,
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string 
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.
It's funny how things work out.

So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.
If you see somebody looks like 
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,
That when you wind it up it plays,
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.

Away in a manger no crib for a bed.
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.

Merry Christmas Everybody.",A John Prine Christmas
John Prine,"City Sidewalks, busy sidewalks

Heard Little Richard singing ""Tutti Frutti""
From the top of a telephone pole

I wasn't hurtin' no one

There's roosters laying chickens and chickens layin' eggs
Farm machinery eating people's arms and legs

John Prine,"Jesus, the missing years

It was raining. It was cold
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old
So he packed his bags and he headed out
To find out what the world's about
He went to France. He went to Spain
He found love. He found pain.
He found stores so he started to shop
But he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop
Kids in trouble with the cops
From Israel didn't have no home
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome
It was there he met his Irish bride
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome...
Italy that is
Music publishers, book binders, Bible belters, Money Changers,
Spoon Benders and lots of pretty Italian chicks.

[Chorus]
Charley bought some popcorn
Billy bought a car
Someone almost bought the farm
But they didn't go that far
Things shut down at midnight
At least around here they do
Cause we all reside down the block
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.

Wine was flowing so were beers
So Jesus found his missing years
So He went to a dance and said ""This don't move me""
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie
On his thirteenth birthday he saw ""Rebel without a Cause""
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind
You see him and the wife wasn't getting along
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song
Called ""The Dove of Love Fell Off the Perch""
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church
At least not back then anyhow
Jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit
So he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and
A Coca-Cola and he swallowed it.
He discovered the Beatles
And he recorded with the Stones
Once He even opened up a three-way package
In Southern California for old George Jones

[Chorus]

The years went by like sweet little days
With babies crying pork chops and beaujolais
When he woke up he was seventeen
The world was angry. The world was mean.
Why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop
All agreed that life stank. All the world smelled like poop
Baby poop that is ..the worst kind
So he grew his hair long and thew away his comb
And headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom, Dad and home
But when he got there the cupboard was bare
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod
He said ""Whatcha gonna be when you grow up?""
Jesus said ""God""
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood
They're gonna kill me Mama. They don't like me Bud.
So Jesus went to Heaven and he went there awful quick
All them people killed him and he wasn't even sick
So come and gather around me my contemporary peers
And I'll tell you all the story of
Jesus, the missing years

Standing by peaceful waters 
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh

Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin Border
There was this Indian tribe
They found two babies in the woods
White babies
One of them was named Elizabeth
She was the fairer of the two
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie
Having never seen white girls before
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway
Became known forever as Lake Marie

Repeat Chorus:

Many years later I found myself talking to this girl
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie
The wind was blowing especially through her hair
There was four italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill
And Man, they was ssssssssizzlin'
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish
Whatever seemed easier
That night she fell asleep in my arms
Humming the tune to ""Louie Louie'
Aah baby, We gotta go now.

Repeat Chorus:

The dogs were barking as the cars were parking
The loan sharks were sharking the narcs were narcing
Practically everyone was there
In the parking lot by the forest preserve
The police had found two bodies
Nay, naked bodies
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object
Saw it on the news On the TV news in a black and white video
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?
Shadows, Shadows that's exactly what it looks like
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed
Slammed up against the banks of Old Lake Marie, Marie

What you doing out there?
Why it's dark as a dungeon way up in the air

Come gather round me you little monkeys and a story I'll tell
About a brave young primate, outer space knew him well
He was born at the top of a big old tree
Way back in 1953.

He could swing through the jungle and hang by his toes
Till they took him to russia cause they could I suppose
They dressed him up in a spacesuit and it started to snow
Shot him off in a rocket where no man would go

Space monkey space monkey
What you doing out there?
Why it's dark as a dungeon way up in the air
There'll be no one to greet you when you get back home
No hammer or sickle you'll be on your own.

He had plenty of cuban bananas and loads of spam
But he found great difficulty trying to open the can
One day he slipped on a banana peel and the ship lost control
It spun out of orbit and shot o]ut the black hole

It's been four decades now, that's nine monkey years
That's a long time for a space monkey to confront all his fears

Space monkey space monkey
What you doing out there?
Why it's dark as a dungeon way up in the air
There'll be no one to greet you when you get back home
No hammer or sickle you'll be all on your own.

Space monkey, space monkey
It's time to get real
The space race is over, how does it feel
Cold war's had a heatwave, iron curtain's torn down
They've rolled up the carpet in space monkey town

Now leningrad is petersburg and petersburg's hell
For a card-carrying monkey with a story to tell
The space monkey was reportedly last sighted about
A half a block off of red square
In a karaoke bar having a few drinks with some of his friends
There was the dog that flew sputnik
And a blind red-headed, one legged parrot
Who had done some minor research for dow chemical
They were drinking american vodka
Imported all the way from paducah, kentucky
And reportedly had their arms around each other's
Shoulders singing.
""those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end""

Space monkey, space monkey
There's nothing to do
But it's better than living in a communist zoo
There'll be no one to greet you when you get back home
No hammer or sickle you'll be all on you own

Just moving along through the drifting snow
It's times like these when the temperatures freeze

And a country band that plays for keeps
They play it so slow

Just beating his hand against a storm window

A candle burns a witch's dreams
Silence is golden 'til it screams
Right through your bones

And stare at the sky so blue?

But it gives me the blues when I've got some good news
And you're not there to bring it to.

Of all the little favors you do.
All wrapped up together no matter the weather,

Well I'm leaving a lot for the little I got
But you know a lot a little will do
And if you give me your love
I'll let it shine up above
And light my way back home to you.

John Prine,"Well, I once knew a man who was going insane
He let love chase him right up a tree
It took the police and a fire truck just to bring him back down
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me

It made the front page of the paper, the gossip tongues wagged
Why they even showed it all on TV
Now if he should live forever, he won't live it down
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me

Dog bites man, man loses girl
Oh, what did he ever do wrong in this world?
Dog bites man, man loses girl
Oh, what have I every done wrong in this world?

There once was a big buzz all over town
About a movie where the killer goes free
Now, he's got everyone's sympathy
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me
Yes, I hate it when that happens to me
",I Hate It When That Happens to Me
John Prine,"You and me, sittin' in the back of my memory
Like a honey bee buzzin' 'round a glass of sweet Chablis
Radio's on, windows rolled up and my mind's rolled down
Headlights shining like silver moon's rollin' on the ground

We made love in every way love can be made
And we made time, look like time could never fade
Friday Night, we both made the guitar hum
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come

Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end
Gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again

Soul to soul, heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Now, come on, baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down
The promise of your sweet love brings me around

Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end
It's gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again and again

John Prine,"The moon is down
All over town
The forecast is gray
Now that she's gone away

The stars in the skies
Fell out of her eyes
They shattered when they hit the ground
And now the moon is down

The sun will be fine
It'll still shine all the time
The sky will be blue
And do what it's supposed to do

You see gravity pulls
But it can't keep you around
It'll be one long day
And now the moon is down

Singing a song in your pickup truck

John Prine,"Far away over the sea
There's a river that's calling to me
That river she runs all around
The place that I call my hometown

There's a valley on the side of the hill
And flowers on an old windowsill
A familiar old picture it seems
And I'll go there tonight in my dreams

Where it's green in the summer
And gold in the fall
Her eyes are as blue
As the sky I recall

Far away over the sea
There's a place at the table for me
Where laughter and music abound
Just waiting there in my hometown

The river she freezes
When there's snow on the ground
And the children can slide
To the far side of town

Far away far away me
Hung up on a sweet memory
I'm lost and I wish I were found
In the arms of my darlin' hometown

With the evening sun sittin'
On the top of the hill
And the mockingbird answering
The old chapel bell

Far away over the sea
My heart is longing to be
And I wish I could lay myself down
In the arms of my darlin' hometown
",My Darlin' Hometown
John Prine,"Why must you always seem to criticize me?
I seems like everything I do just turns out wrong
Why don't you come on out and despise me
So I could pack my bag and baby I'd be gone?

Remember when you used to call me honey
Well, I'd turn around and call you honey too
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny
To hurt someone who's so in love with you

A clown puts his make-up on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town

My body's in this room with you just catching hell
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list
But I'm leaning on the jukebox and I'm about half way there

A clown puts his make-up on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town

I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer
When you get done talking I'll come back downstairs
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares

A clown puts his make-up on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
I'm across the river on the other side of town
In my mind I'm going to the dog racing side of town

John Prine,"Well, he never got too lonely
And he never got too sad
But he never got too happy
And that's what's just too bad

He never reached much further
Than his lonely arms would go
He wore a seatbelt around his heart
And they called him Safety Joe

Safety Joe, Safety Joe
(Safety Joe, Safety Joe)
What do you say? What do you know?
If you don't loosen up the buckle
On your heart and start to chuckle
You're gonna die of boredom, Safety Joe

Now, Joe he lived in Baltimore
'Cause New York was too darn fast
He sometimes went down to Washington
Just to view our nation's past

He never ate his vegetables
'Cause they were just too darn chewy
And he never climbed much higher
Than the arch in old St. Louis

Safety Joe, Safety Joe
(Safety Joe, Safety Joe)
What do you say? What do you know?
If you don't loosen up the buckle
On your heart and start to chuckle
Well, you're gonna die of boredom, Safety Joe

Where's that mandolin?
It's the chorus

Joe gradually grew meaner
By not changin' his demeanor
But he never did nothin'
Too much for too long

Therefore his life never got much richer
Than the day they took that picture
In his birthday suit
On the day that he was born

Safety Joe, Safety Joe
(Safety Joe, Safety Joe)
What do you say? What do you know?
If you don't loosen up the buckle
On your heart and start to chuckle
Well, you're gonna die of boredom, Safety Joe

John Prine,"She is my everything
From her sun tanned shoulders
Down to the freckles on her wedding ring

Her feet is so warm
They can melt the snow in the early spring
She is my everything

She goes everywhere
From Copenhagen to makin' eggs and bacon
Down in Jackson Square

I?d like to drive a Cadillac
The color of her long black hair
She goes everywhere

Kisses that come all the way from China
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain
If I get lost, you can always find her
Standing right beside me in the rain

She uses the Eveready
Batteries to keep her electrical
Appliances going steady

She can do 14 things at once
And then her phone?ll ring
She is my everything

She knows everybody
From Muhammad Ali to teaching Bruce Lee
How to do Karate

She could lead a parade
While puttin' on her shades in her Masaratti
She knows everybody

Kisses that come all the way from China
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain
If I get lost, you can always find her
Standing right beside me in the rain

That's when the birdies start to sing

When I hear her voice

I believe it was yesterday
I would have invited him in

Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before

Speaks volumes of shame

And never takes the blame
Upsets my constitution
Beyond its motor frame

With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel

Or a feller that sells you glue,

Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you gotta be a father to a girl
She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
In a fair hand dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money,
But, I'll try, I'll try! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!",Soliloquy
John Raitt,"Soft breeze, whispering trees
The summer winds are sighing
The leaves are lullabying
Violins are all around you
I can hear the chords resound
Of sounding brass
That seems to say I've found
I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

John Raitt,"There's many a man that rode a horse across the western plain
There's never been one like the Irishman
O'Sullivan was his name.

He never packed a shooting iron
The need he never felt
With two shillelaghs always hanging there
A'hanging on his belt.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Har the shillelagh. 
You know we call it the Tipperary rifle. 
You never have to reload it.

This bronco-busting Irishman
From the heart of Erin's Isle
It was after living peaceful, like
He always wore a smile.
But when the smile was leaving him
In a fight he'd
Come unwound
Bad cess for any crossing him
They'd wind up on the ground.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Why he was so strong was Sullivan, 
He could put his right hand in his own left pocket, 
And hold himself out at arm's length. 
No man could do that. 
It's O'Sullivan I'm talking about.
Oh, well he could.

At throwing the rope for branding calf
He was a mighty man
At throwing his two shillelaghs now
The fastest in the land.

T'would be a sad mistake me boys
To reach for a 44
Before you could get the hammer cocked
He'd have you on the floor.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Did you know O'Sullivan played the Irish Harp? 
No. Oh, sure, and he did. 
He put 75 strings on his two shillelaghs,
He'd stretch them out 24 feet, and he had four leprechauns
Dancing on them to make the music. 
Oh, the wonder of it. 
Sure and he would charm the coyotes out of the hills

Across the range from morn 'til night
He rode for days and days
A'fixin' fences here and there
And a picking up the strays.

A cattle spread he really built
As big as Ireland
Where he could range a million head
And a shamrock be his brand.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

A bit of his lip, he back of his hand, 
And the toe of his shoe to boot. 
Oh, Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan.

Now if you're ever riding through the sagebrush wilderness,
And you suddenly come upon acres and acres of shamrock sprinkled with stardust, 
Well, you'll be after knowing,that you've just arrived 
at the O Sullivan spread, 
Known has the Lazy Leprachauns. 
Stop in, won't you? 
Sure, and they'll give you a belt of Bushmill's.",Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan

Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-

Of the girl who taught me there was so much in this world worth living.
The part that you've been playing has me dazed and missing you.

The promise never harvested in fallow fields shall lie.
In a shallow grave of stubble field and half-remembered lies.

How can a bed of roses hurt so much to lie upon?

Could fill it back up right now as the tears fall from my eyes.

John Ralston,"Baby there will come a day when our lives are over.
I know those movies make you sad, but you've got my shoulder.
You don't believe in heaven, babe.
Well then, I don't either.
But maybe there will come a world where we'll find each other.

If I leave before you do, I swear I'll find my way to you.
I'll hold you tightly when you sleep; I'll kiss you.

Baby just the other day I got these strange sensations.
Like somebody stepped on my grave; such a bad vibration.
I wondered if our memories would stay when we go.
I wondered would we recognize each other's soul.
But maybe there will come a world where we'll find each other.

If I leave before you do, I swear I'll find my way to you.
I'll hold you tightly when you sleep; I'll kiss you.

We were so sure that it was our fate

By a forest of pine

I called it mine

There was mist every morning
It hung suspended in air
Diffusing rays of the sunlight
Making a glow of the glare

Is it a funeral for heart and soul?
Is it a funeral for heart and soul?

One day some strangers stopped over
And so I wasn't alone
They started to like it out here
They started calling it home

Retreated into my bedroom
I was locked, barred and bored
And now the bird at my window
She doesn't sing anymore

Just a singing boy whose songs were worn
Like zippered scars waiting to be born
Waiting to be born, waiting to be

Insurance men keep you alive
All the times I should have been there
Keeping hope above your bed at night

So when I tell you I'm not alone

Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With one hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To say on earth that my Franklin do live",Lord Franklin

I find better things in which to place my energy
Diverse family, we up and at ?em full fashion
Been locked up in the lab mixin' up this contraption

Smackin' the mic with verbs and nouns of life
I utilize my time right
To hold it down and keep it tight
And then decipher that I step through

Yeshua equals life so I don't separate the two
True peace 'n joy
More love to the connector
Illuminate your town as we hit your sector

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

Well, let me come into the track, yes, y'all
Bring it on back, yes, y'all
One time for the mental piece release
Mos def John Reuben will decrease

Christ increased inspired lyrics hit your soul direct blow
How we communicate, graf DJ and break
Take a minute, now listen and dissect the intuition
More than ear candy but yo, I dwell in submission

To Heavenly powers, hours on end I spend
Lookin' for creative combinations to blend
Now that's a good combination
That's a good combination

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

In the place to be bringin' it out like
Like dots, I connect my rhymes to the spot
Warp speed like I'm trekky, to bang heads of block
To rock, to petrify, combust with mad rush
More cool than that J to bring that cold crush

Transcend, runnin' through this whole scheme
Seen with raps, stay fresh, more ultra to the V
I'm clutching microphones and roamin' through them zones
And melodies I release serk ambassadors and vocal tones

Shooting missiles from the lab, I contract, bust verbal raps
Ripping, torn through, and spilling into laps
Douse lyricals with divine divinity
To rise above the normal mediocre plain MC

Let me introduce 'cause I feel' I'm rev'd and heated
In a state of mass destruct MCs like they never existed
Seein' stars, like I'm spangle in your banner
Christian manner, be-boy for Christ, roaring like I'm Judah

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

John Reuben,"Spoken
What, what? what's the fuss?
You know what, man?
Yeah?

You pay five bucks to come in here to just stand in the back and act like you're to hard to enjoy yourself
Well actually, I didn't have to pay
To each his own correct then don't select my flavor
While I see them in the back critiquin' my behavior

Trying to take create n' shape me to fit this mold
He yelled out sellout but maybe he wasn't told
So let me tell a shallow mind why we do what we do
I create for the Creator not to impress you

Challenge your thinking but not to test you
You might not like me, I'll still say God bless you
And address the issue it's all love and respect
And honestly bro, I don't think that's too much to expect

But too many times, the shallow mind will keep you caught
You can't escape from thinkin' all you ever been taught
Is that you walk this way
You talk this way

You front this way
You pose this way
You act this way
Na na, that ain't me, I got to be who God created me to be

Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Why is it as humans we cling on to only what we know
Never expandin', steppin' out that comfort zone
We rock alone and the roam in ignorance

Turn back around and use it as a defense
For shallowness this seems to be a concern
'Cause not knowin' is an excuse for those unwillin' to learn
Alright I need all the people to the front to the back

To back to front, lets get down, we gonna do it like this
Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Original material, my crew non-stop
We keepin' it fly, we turnin' out

Y'all feel us on that? No doubt!
Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Original material, my crew non-stop
We keepin' it fly, we turnin' out

Y'all feel us on that? No doubt!
Do not stereotype the individual
'Cause what you hear in your stereo is not the typical
Stereotypes get broken down, we're non-provokin'

New levels of thought to leave the shallow mind open
Cats aproachin' me without no lack or no clue
I understand though bro, see someone's been trainin you
To think like you think and act like you do

Its getting old, not like it should have ever been new
But as long as shallowness exists, I shal persist
To rip apart the whole structure and expose the nucleus
Shallowness exists, I shall persist to rip apart the whole structure and expose it for what it is

Lack of understanding, Lack of communication
Lack of a desire for expanding education
Lack of inspiration, Lack of innovation
The fact you can't respect another man's creation
Lack of motivation, Lack of restoration
The fact we lack unity and enjoy separation
Lack of destination 'cause you know what I feel
I feel that humans lack the ability to be real",Do Not
John Reuben,"Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

God of creation here I stand
I've left Babylon to find out who I am
I've traveled I've struggled I've failed in vain
My own ability will never see eternal gain
God of creation it's you whom I seek
Lord I feel strapped and tied down and my strength is weak
Oh Lord when I cry out please hear what I speak
Bring life to my body awaken this sleep

Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

When all vanishes and I stand in this place to face the truth for what it is
With no human escape to hide behind just my soul and God and I find it mind blowing
Knowin' that humanity and a mere mortal man like me
Can have my slate cleaned of mistakes and the chance to put on immortality
Even though darkness has hardened us in deception and spoken otherwise
Man I refuse to take in that nonsense, and I refuse to buy into these lies
These lies of pain, these lies of shame, these lies of complete dysfunction
This lie of hopelessness that will make a person feel like they're nothing
This lie that will make me feel like my struggle is one too much to fix'n
Isn't that what darkness wants for me to play the role of a victim
But I'm a child of light and no longer am I bound by slavery
I say oh death were is your sting
And oh Hades where's your victory?

Hear my cry oh God
Attend to my prayer
From the end of the earth I will cry to you
When my heart's overwhelmed I will cry to you
Leave it to the rock that is higher than I
For you have been a shelter for me
I will abide in your time forever
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

John Reuben,"Love is God and God is love no one's below no one's above
Sing it like
Love is God and God is love no one's below no one's above

Thinkin' of my past motivates my future
Will I make or break love or hate
Now tell me who's the fake n who's the snake man
Who can I trust so many promises I seen bust
Justice never accomplished right so I gotta let that go
And keep movin yeshua illuminate my path
And keep me tuned in so much negative around for me
To still get consumed in, but I still have peace
In the misdst of confusion I still have peace in the midst of confusion

Even though I know my life has purpose
I find myself down n' out feelin' worthless
And defenseless against them that rise against me
But I still call no man my enemy
'Cause competition is none no competitors
Matthew 5 44 has got me prayin' for predators
Turnin' cheeks on the regular so throw your dart
And chances are you'll hit the heart
But never take me apart because I'm found in yeshua
So who can be agaist me that's what I thought
Nobody

But I got love for them all so much love for them all

John Reuben,"Hello there ego why it's a displeasure to meet ya
To be honest bro I really don't know how to treat ya
Greet ya with a pound but you want more than dat
And to be honest I really don't know how to act
I hear the blah blah blahblah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah
Man I watch your ego spoil for thinkin you're
Fresher than all else

Face full of perspiration from sweatin' yourself
Lettin' yourself act like a fool man look
I don't care about your personalized hip-hop rule book
Took another man's thoughts on rules for the microphone
How can I respect your opinion when it's not your own
Known fact you have an ego you need to lose it
'cause if you're so real why you tryin' so hard to prove it
It should just be and if it is then we don't need
A constant reminder that you're the dopest mc

[Chorus]
So you're the illest so you're the dopest
So you're the slickest man why you tellin' me this
In one ear and out the next all I keep on hearing is
Blah blah blah

Hello there ego can I call you out for what you are
John doe status but you're fronting superstar
More like super far from reality
But I guess it's trendy to make it look like actuality
Now let me see too many claim where they want to be
And not where they're at
I'll call your front and all those who got your back
Let it be known clone mimicks nah you won't last
You don't have a future 'cause you didn't have a past
So in the present please don't get perturbed

If I pay no attention to you and your pointless idle words
'Cause time is precious and I have better things to do
Than waste my energy on hearing you brag about you
Recyclin' hip-hop the same old same old
How you're so fresh and all else is stale n' old
It's getting old plus man I've heard it all before
Pointless verses covered up in metaphors
Now catchin' rec is one thing that's cool to express
But there's only so many ways that you can tell me
You're the best",Hello Ego
John Reuben,"Well I'm a John Reuben from the land or corn
Columbus, Ohio that's where I was born in
By mom Kathleen on January 14
1979 I entered the scene lookin' like

Hello mother girl what's goin' on
One moment I'll be here and then the next I'll be gone
But while I'm chillin' out there's somethings I'd like to see
Like some sanity, some family and some diversity

Well look at me in a flash my time's passed and I've aged
Adrenaline within me has got me up on the stage
Lookin' for ways to amaze and light up the place
It was me and nine other MC's called the showcase

Ten immature young bucks run amuck
Throwin' out whatever's clever and just hopin' it stuck
What what what's goin' on there moving to the beat
I guess that's why we have no choice but to keep

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

I'm sayin' him, her, he or she
A John Reuben gotta lotta somethin' for everybody
Step into the party tardy in fashion
Up in here this year quite clear with a passion

To make it happen and I'm loving life fact
See God is good and I won't backtrack
But move forward bendin' words in ways not thought possible
See any beat is rockable this feelin' is unstoppable

Because the mind is full of creative energy
I'm not leavin' tonight until my brain is empty
Thoughts pour out as I skillfully explore out
Routes n' patterns in which to flex raps

I'm gatherin' kids from all directions, multicomplexions
You feelin' this then add a pound to the collection
Another session yes I'm there move back
Bring in the boom sti cat to boom ta boom cat
Like that we keep it simple n' fresh like yes y'all yes

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

I got eight bars to fill in
So it's time for me to start skillin'

N' it's time for me to start illin'
Party people in the back cold chillin'
All people get live n' all people get live n' energize with me
All people get live n' energize with me

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We go with him, her, he or she

John Reuben,"Trained to fail before I could walk
Now I'm undoing 20 years of lies I've been taught
Not always easy let the past be forgot,
When memories keep you caught
Let's travel back, now hold up stop, why
'Cause if I dwell on the past I get focused to who I'm not
I strive to stay away but that ain't easy
When who I was wants to control my destiny testing me
Man, it's got me tripping
Its in these moments of despair I feel my foundation's slipping 
Its starts ripping leaving me broken
Now I'm completely confused and I'm vulnerable and open
I try to run, but who am I running from?
See, what within myself this battle has come 
So basically, You say it's up to me
'Cause I'm my greatest ally or my worst enemy

I stepped out of my body to let God slide in
Although I'm still dressed in flesh I spiritually died in
Alive in Christ, a new creation started breathing
Life exists and through this came completion
Life exists and through this came completion

Get your mind body and soul under control 
Who am I? Identify
Who are You? All is new

I feel like my soul keeps challenging my spirit
And my spirit keeps challenging my soul
Which ever one I choose to exercise the most
Will be the one to obtain control
Man, I feel like I got multi-personalities
I dabble in multi-mentalities
My own thoughts hold me captive in a world of confusion
As the monipulation increases gradually
Now If a lies placed before me and I buy into it
Then am I responsible for the deception?
If I have no acceptance
Who's to blame for these feelings of rejection?
Man I bring these feelings of confusion
I challenge all that my heart believes
I'm the one that drags my past up from the grave
Telling myself I",Identify
John Reuben,"Man it's hard lookin' back an now able to see in
Wishin' to God sometimes that I could do it all again
Strugglin' can start to take it's toll
16 years old tryin' to change what you can't control
And it's not your fault but tell me what can you do
When things fall apart and everybody's lookin' at you
With two fingers pointed screamin' get it together
But who's in the mix to show me any better
So whatever I'm runnin' on my own solo
Tryin' to make things happen off the little bit I know
And I guess I'll get what I get but yet
I don't want to live my life full of regrets

To the future in the palm of God's hand 
To the past as of now
That I can't understand
To the future uncertain unclear
To the past I left to bring me here I stay I pray

The earth rotates and my world keeps spinnin'
Feelin' like I never started but it's all endin'
And I stand here lonely a million familiar faces
But yet no one truly knows me
So I'll try to move on and I'll try to know how
But the truth is I'm really just runnin' from the now
I can't handle it I feel like the future's all I got
Don't want to deal with my past
I choose memory block to stop how I feel don't want to be
Real with it, run from reality in attempts to deal with it
But it's not workin' and I'm still hurtin'
Nah it's not workin' and I'm still searchin'

[Chorus]
No regrets no regrets but it's hard
No regrets no regrets I say
No regrets no regrets I stay in him in him

I'm tryin' to live right and pass on what I believe
But it's hard to give when you can't receive
Yet I'm learnin' slowly n surely
And I'm secure enough to admit my insecurity
See I know something in me has got to change
God of creation I hear you callin' my name
Offerin' peace n joy and freedom from shame
Offerin' nothin' to lose but a life to gain",No Regrets
John Reuben,"Age ten I began to understand
That throughout life there would be no end to strugglin'
But then again what can you comprehend
With no one to trust or on whom I could depend
But here I am now stand and adult
I gotta be responsible and it is my fault
For my present situation 
Even though I wasn't taught on how to handle what I'm facin'
I'm gonna make it happen
Bump procrastination today is now so nows become my destination
Waitin' on the voice of God for where to go and
I'll put my hope in you I'll say to no man

Rest easy easy I say I say whom shall I fear",Rest Easy
John Reuben,"Broken reality there's no means of escape 
Broken reality lookin' to leave this mind-state 
But the more that I leaave the harder it is to come 
Back 
Now I'm livin' out these lies that I call my trap 
And I call it that 'cause I didn't do this intentionally 
What I now call my trap I used to call my fantasy 
And why do I fantasize in order to leave the reality 
Of not being able to relate personally or socially 
Sometimes I wonder what it would feel like to be 
Respected 
But until then I'll dream about bein' accepted 
I wonder what it would feel like to be respected 

[Chorus] 
All wrong no right no one no sun no light this life 
This fight I'll hide inside no matter where you go you 
Can't escape what's inside 

man somebody get me out of this place 
Of lonliness hopelessness depression and disgrace 
At this pace I'm on the verge of self-destruction 
With nothin' to go on but my self instruction 
So what then does that leave me 
I try to communicate with the world, but none of you 
Out there could perceive me 
So instead of words I began to express through action 
So anger n' rage became my mere satisfaction hate 
Fills my being I'm seeing no means of release 
So I escape into my fantasy where I live in peace 
Here I can be anybody I want to here I can be anybody 
I choose to 
Here in this place I feel good there's no restriction 
This place is so good that it's become my addiction 

I say I'm not lost but why am I searchin 
I say pain don't fade me but then again why am I 
Hurtin' 
I say I won't show emotion but yet 
I can't hide these eyes that have been stained by 
Tears 
I say I can't be held back but yet I've been in the 
Same place for years 
I say I wanna feel free but somethin' keeps me bound 
I say I wanna go higher but my feet haven't even left 
The ground 
Man I told y'all I didn't care but then again why is 
My heart heavy 
I told the world to bring it on but deep down I knew I 
Wasn't ready 
I said I couldn't be deceived meanwhile I'm walking 
Into the same old traps 
I said I couldn't be broke as I watched my world 
Collapse 
As I watch my world collapse 
Watch my world collapse 

[Chorus] 

No matter where you go you can't escape what's inside 
No matter where you go you can't escape what's inside 
No matter where you go you can't escape what's inside 
No matter where I go",X-Ray
John Reuben,"[Chorus]
breathe in breathe out i'm tired of holding my breath
it's been a while since i've seen this side surface feeling far from home 
and distant from purpose worthless this earth is 
i wished to vanish from it is it pointless or am i too stupid to take advantage of it 

isn't life more valuable than just existing 
and aren't dreams more valid than just simple wishing 
force myself to listen sit in the silent golden as it may be at times 
it feels violent but i'll be patient and wait for your calm to come 

even though i get anxious and feel the urge to run for 
i know where my strength comes from even though 
i get anxious and feel the urge to run 

[Chorus]

sometimes you feel like no one can stop you 
and other times you feel like you have nothing to offer like right now 
i might be scared to death of death and tomorrow 
i won't even care about my next breath left in the dark 

mad i can't see somewhere between pride and apathy 
and i continue on and press past the chaos i feel i just wish for one moment 
it would all stand still for real i wish the world would just stop 
and let me catch my breath return to that place of child 

like rest in attempts to gain more sometimes you come up less 
it's got me wanting to get away i guess were all looking for a place of simplicity 
but it's a complex world and you can't hide from it's activity but it sure would be nice 
to leave the world around so i run towards the sun to shed the earth that surrounds

John Reuben,"[Chorus]
Reuben, what is he Dipidy doin'

This ego was quick to say he was better than me better be correct
Before you step and try to sever my integrity please
You MC's need to quit it
I mean do you really think that you're the only ones that get it
And what is it we don't get huh?
Maybe that empty book bag that you sport as a gimmick
To the Timberland boots that have never been scuffed
All the while you're still hollering rugged and rough
I call your bluff you're just like the rest of them
The only difference is you follow a less popular trend friend
Tell me how are you going to dog the mainstream
Then turn around the underground and do the exact same thing that you're dissing
You get what I'm putting down
I say a gimmick can be found above as well as underground
And since what's real can't be defined by culture or man
I'm curious as to what makes you think that you can
(Sing along!)

[Chorus]

Ideas start occurring and words start stirring
Never would I suggest this to be the best
It's just I like putting words on mics
It's something I like to do something I find nice
Don't need to dominate or inflate my confidence
Got no problem giving MC's complements
But some get mad at me like they want to battle me
Upset because I made their hip hop happy
Actually I think you tough guys are corny
And my LP comes with a foolproof warranty
If you buy it and don't like it feel free not to listen
I'm not sure about a refund but you're welcome to diss it
Because I don't will not and won't ask you to
React to the beat if you ain't feeling it
But perhaps maybe you are in that case
It goes one for the treble two for the bass
Arrogance mixed with ignorance will and can bring forth a man
That don't really understand but claims he does
And you know what, that?s not good
[No that's not good]

[Chorus]

You know what? Y'all got to be kidding
Man, some of y'all treat art like it was some sort of religion
Following the rules one two and on through
To the point you don?t create art, art created you
Y,all got to be kidding man
Some of y,all treat hip hop like it was some sort of religion
Following the rules one two and on through
To the point you don?t create hip hop, hip hop created you",Doin'
John Reuben,"I screamed to God out of frustration
After another day of waking and hating the fact
That I'm still where I'm at, what's the point of all of this
'Cause I'm not seeming to find it

Is it meaningless? I search the reason behind it
Because these moments seem to drag on forever
And these years on end seem to have never been this
Desperation has formed repetition within to insecure, to pretend
And I'm too weak to defend

Here it comes again all in my world
Again left with no direction, no beginning, no end
The days blend together and the weather never changes
Numb to the outcome but yet not quite painless

Aimless to whether or not I made a mistake
And if so, how far is too far? Before it's too late
Should I wait but then what would be too long
To reverse the effects if I was wrong

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Is it a must that I'm here?
Is it a must that I stay in order to look forward?
Must I look away? We're moving towards a new day
Unsure of what tomorrow will bring our way

I'm not even quite sure of what this day holds
I say we travel the unknown and watch it unfold
Hold today close while still reaching for tomorrow
Through the test of time, I've seen joy overcome sorrow

So with every trial I endure with hopes
To mature into what I was created
For more than life itself, I want life itself
Press past the present until forever is felt

And take hold of the hidden mystery wide-eyed and open
I now see differently, if it's to be then give me the strength
To be content and find peace in knowing
One day it will all make sense

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Learning to accept the unexpected
Because the unknown wasn't here for me to correct it
So I let it go and stopped trying to control the impossible
Simply put tossed in the shuffle
At a young age just like everyone else

So I don't feel sorry for you or for myself
Love is bigger than that
And I'm not below or above the way it moves
Even though the things it does to my train of thought
Can bring about doubt and uncertainty

Patience tends to not agree with my psyche
That's more than likely, just some pride in me
Fighting expectations of where I think my life should be
Selfishly I forget, so quickly let me never forget

Lord, break me in humility
Some sort of amazing grace on me
As I look back upon my life
And where You've taken me

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Hear the call, peace fall from trial to triumph
I want your hand in it all
Allow me to know where to stand in it all
Life giver

John Reuben,"You ever felt somethin' you couldn't explain? 
No definition, no name. 
Just a feeling. 
No definition, no name.

I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different, I said,
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different, than I, than I... 
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured...hold up.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.

And then there was me:
Analyzing life more than I was living.
Anything possible good,
I destroyed before the chance was ever given.

See, if I never have anything, 
I'll never have to lose anything; 
but then again if I never had anything worth losing 
I guess I lost everything.

Either way, you could say, 
Pain will become a result from both,
So actually I'm giving in to the very thing that I fear the most: 
Losing it all, 
Everything,
Completely unaware, 
That a fear of failure was the one thing that was taking me there.

Fear of life, 
Fear of love, 
Fear of man, 
Failure to relate
How I and God, and His voice to me
Would even begin to translate. 

So I wait 
To escape
This condition of rationalizing my own destruction. 
But I keep on listening to the voices that don't deserve my discussion. 

I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it. 
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.

John Reuben,"Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

Hot coffee keep me awake for goodness sake
It's late and now I'm feeling it, I've got so much on the mind
With the need to unwind, leave the day behind
Now are you feeling it, there's nothing wrong with that, right?

Everyone needs a break in life, so I'm going to take one tonight
Empty the stress and find rest instead double dose of comatose
Drain my head and go brain dead, I went blank
I thank God for these moments when I don't have to think

I'm up in here while the night is near
Hey DJ Manuel, put the music in my ear
Let me hear something contagious, infectious
Play the set with freshness, ah yes
I guess the guest list includes you and I
And everyone else that chose to reply

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

The sun is setting, letting the night creep on
In outside in the streets, I see the folks peeking in
One by one, they start to slowly leak in, looking lovely
My friends, what a unique blend

A collection of humanity brought to one
Spot individuals ready to unleash what they got
Yes and yes indeed bring something slick
To mix up the evening from entering to the time of leaving

We kept on and must continue, keeping your interest peeking
'Cause you came seeking for more than the ordinary
Less than extraordinary, Lord prepare me
'Cause I don't want to move on illusion, hibernation

In a fantasy of confusion I choose, so I chose the life giver
'Cause how could we create without love for the Creator?

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

Come here folks, we're about to provoke the night
Promote the night, not just soak in the night
Take advantage of the night, speak life through the night
Driven to give them some sort of peace in the night

While I'm with them, I'm spitting wisdom hoping to hit them
Get them to listen and make the room start living, come alive
We're about to tune it right, take my hand
We're about to dance under the moon light

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

",Run the Night
John Reuben,"(chorus)
Hey sound man turn me up man let it surround them 
Right here right now 

It?s up to him to mix me in with my vocal blend from start to end 
No party crashin me and my fellow mc?s we keep it smashin 
Enter the place and watch the crowd start reactin 
With the all shoot back up back up Mr. Sound Man turn my track up track up 
Even though I might be the act to open up 
Show me love dear friend please don?t jack me up 

(chorus)

Sound man I trust you 
It?s a must to hop on your toys and raise the noise up 
To a volume that makes the people want to swoon free 
Up the music to consume the room 
'cause when it comes down to it 
All that we?ve got is MC?s and DJ?s 
And whether or not the man on the boards can afford to feel friendly 
To every mc never make the sound man your enemy 

(chorus)

Big headed mc?s and uptight bands all over the land 
They?re ticking off the sound man 
Ego?s on ten but in the same trend 
You?ve got sound folk who provoke and do it to them 
Not to mention the security guard who tries hard to be hard 
And takes his job a little too far 
And I understand your need for attitude
But I don?t see why we need to spare the gratitude 
So I?ll be the first to say job well done 
Thank you sound man you?re second to none

I also speak on behalf of the DJ 
And on that note I feel we?ve earned the right to say

(chorus)
",Soundman
John Reuben,"Give the band a round of applause join the cause 
As me and Man child flap our jaws and rap raw, huh
Got to be optimistic 
We twist it different your paradigm is shifted 
And it's positively terrific audibly 
We flipped it awkwardly 
How do we did it done it dang it or do I mean do it 
Keep it fluid let's move it 
I make people music, music sweet music 
Every now and then you have to renew it 
Still the formula stays the same we just like to mix the elements 
And watch them rearrange because change is good 
It keeps perspective keen 
But trying to be different don't really mean that you're doing anything 
That hasn't been done still 
The style is identical to none 

[Chorus]
Oh yes and the band plays on 
Every where we go it's the same old song
See I know there's really nothing new under the sun 
But yet I want to do it like it's never been done 

I'm not even sure what's next 
I'll let my thoughts collect and do my best to connect 
Without begging for your respect 
Or maybe just a little what the heck 
Now, you enter in new mindset 
Yup fresh water gets the mind wet 
Are we there yet 
On point yet 
All that I am or all I can 
Until there's nothing left

My gift of gab is sort of sweet a summer night's dream
Capture the elaborate colours that life brings 
Paint a vivid picture put the pieces in their places 
Ain't many saying A through Z to make their statements 
To get your point across in 8 bars is a task 
To make them wanna hear more of your point of views advanced 
We're up until all hours of the night
Dropping the science that drives us in life
Christ and opportunities to rock the mic

[Chorus: x2]",Thank You
John Reuben,"This vulnerability is killing me internally
Not feeling much stability and I wish it could be easy
But it don't seem to be and so 
I'm going to take it to the only place that I know to go
And lay these feelings in the hand of the creator
God of creation you show me how to relate to her
Mean while, I'm thanking you for lessons being learned
See my feelings have been shallow but I've watched my heart turn
Yes, she looks good, yes she looks fly

But deep down I know there's something more inside
Just like I'm praying that there's more in me
So when I look at she I just don't see naturally
Not saying physically, that I'll deny the attraction
But all in all that's just a simple satisfaction
That can be obtained through a glance of the eye
This was five years ago, man how time flies by
Beautiful soul full of spirit
I wonder if she'd hear it if I told her that she had a
Beautiful soul full of spirit
A few year later

Her mind intrigues me
It leaves me sort of sick
Wondering what makes the mystery chic tick, history thick of pages and pages
Telling stories that can't be summed up in quick phrases
She's observant so she's seen my behavior
It's got me nervous wanting to stay away from her
I pray for her daily as well as perspective, 
Battling with pride and thoughts of being rejected and that's just not appealing
It's almost enough to make you disconnect your feelings or something
And try to move on and give them to someone else 
But yet I care for her more than I care for myself
Man who needs this

I'm not even good with commitments
Plus I value my independence, in the end it's probably 
Just a waste of time spent or maybe 
There's something more to this relationship
What's the point of caring when it hurts so much
If this is what love comes with I'd rather not touch it
In all honesty the outcome is uncertain 
And I do run the risk of walking away hurting
Searching for clarity, spare me the despair
I'd rather be alone and not even care 
Than to share my trust because you can't control 
Fate so maybe I'll be alone but at least it's safe
I know that's stupid
Probably my insecurity

Or maybe god is using this to get through to me
Because in the back of my mind 
I'm always aware of pushing me towards prayer and bettering my character
Making me thing about the man I want 
To become regardless of the situations outcome
Fast forward a few years into my life
Man this song about my wife took me five years to write",5 Years to Write
John Reuben,"Step away, keep your distance
I can't be what you want me to be
But right now there are things 
Inside I don't want you to see
So take your personal spotlight
Shine it on someone else for a while
I can't force a happy face or 
Makeshift you a smile

I can't deny what I see, what I feel or 
What's in front of me
So take your world of 
Precious moments of make believe
They never made me believe in anything
But left me with nothing to hold on to

Your quick fix and magic tricks can only 
Disguise what I was going through
And now I'm thinkin' it was when it wasn't
And now I'm tryin' to rationalize
What just doesn't come together and 
Somehow doesn't make sense
But God, how can I convince them 
When I'm not even convinced?

Everyone is thinkin' it, but nobody's sayin' it
Everyone's sayin' it, but nobody's feeling it
Everyone's feeling it, but nobody's seein' it
So how am I supposed to know what's real?

False sense of happiness
My security wrapped up in this
These control freaks seek out who they 
Can brainwash and make activists
They'd rather have me lie than bring 
My failure to the light
Keep your secrets to yourself

It's not about you but them lookin' right
No time to be ugly
Don't trouble them with your doubt and fears
Shout for joy little boys and girls
You brokenness ain't welcome here
Well excuse me while I bleed through 
And my life becomes see through
Don't ask for transparency but 
Reject what you seein' too

Everyone is thinkin' it, but nobody's sayin' it
Everyone is sayin' it, but nobody's feelin' it
Everyone is feelin' it, but nobody is seein' it
So tell me, how am I supposed to know what's real?

Everyone is thinkin' it, everyone is feelin' it
But nobody is seeing it and how
Am I supposed to feel?
How am I supposed to know what's real?

So please can somebody tell me 
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?
You tell me now
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?

Jesus, please tell me
How are they gonna know you're real
When we're told and controlled how to feel
Jesus, tell me please
How they gonna know you're real
When they're controlled and told how to feel?
You tell me
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?

You tell me please, God
How are they gonna know that you're real
When they're told and controlled how to feel?
You tell me please
How am I supposed to know what's real?
How are they supposed to know what's real?
How are they supposed to know what's real?
How are you and I supposed to know?

We whip it up and play games with subject matter
In the stage of life, this is but a chapter

We gonna keep on pushin' on and on

Burn it permanent in the mind of those who misinterpret
Those who are uncertain if what we do here is a good thing
Road blocks won't stop us we must keep on pushing
I am not opposed to losing, I just do not believe in quitting

What a wonderful world? Our God is babysitting
And I am just a visitor
But while I'm here I'll do my best to stand and deliver
Exact is it or rather I can get

And I admit, I'm not one hundred percent accurate
Split me fifty-fifty, I'd be happy with half of it

John Reuben,"I'm not alright, I haven't been myself lately
I'm not okay with the way I've let my thoughts overtake
Take me away to the place I should have gone
I hope I'm not here for long

I'll see you when I'm better

It's gotta get worse to get better
It went from no way, never to okay, whatever
Slowly but surely and sure as sure is blurry
Now things that once were me are no longer
Every so often God reminds me
But I'm always there in front to blind me
I value my pride more than peace of mind

There was a time when I had control but I let it go
I watched the world passin' slow-mo

I wish I could control myself but I can't

I guess circumstances can leave you numb
Plus, I refused accountability
It seemed like such small things you found in me
I called you secluded and alluded to the fact that your concerns were silly
Don't over-react
Now looking back in hindsight, huh
I'm able to see that you were right
Is it too late for me?
I know it's not
It's just up to me to choose to stop

John Reuben,"Taught young, the worldâ€™s wisdom
I told lifeâ€™s a game, the earth will be your stadium
Be alert, pay attention
(One day) Even your friends will become the competition
Trust no one but do remember this, never burn any potential bridges
Know whoâ€™s who, and what they can do for you
And donâ€™t feel bad causeâ€™ in the end theyâ€™re gonna do it to you too
Remember lifeâ€™s not fair
In order to maintain, your gonna have to let you sensitivity be trained
A machine more than a human being
What you say doesnâ€™t always have to be what you mean
Tell them what they want to hear if itâ€™s to your benefit
And words beyond closed doors are insignificant
Push yourself, never be satisfied
Even if you donâ€™t get it, at least you died knowing you tried

Born, live, strive, succeed
Gain it all, bye, now itâ€™s time to leaveâ€¦
Now, all we see is now

Taught young, the worldâ€™s wisdom
Begin to pay attention and make my own observations
All of the kids working hard for admiration
Trying their best not to meet their social expiration
Kind of hard in a world this finicky
Easily praised and yet destroyed just as quickly
I guess me and this world must not be compatible, cause I donâ€™t want its approval to feel valuable

So whoâ€™s next to climb the wall of success, just to see how good the top truly gets
Chasing lies disguised as going somewhere only to arrive and realize itâ€™s really no whereâ€™
Thatâ€™s even if you get there in the first place
What an incredible let down weâ€™re bound to face when we substitute purpose for cheap counterfeit
Too busy trying to succeed in life that we forget to live it
You can live in the infinite or give in to the immediate
Gain it all but someday youâ€™ll have to leave it
This world is temporary and itâ€™s heart is selfish
Think to yourself, is this what wealth is
But now, all we see is now and now is not a bad thing but now does bring tomorrow then
Now becomes then
Moments escape, new ones replace them
Donâ€™t want to face the end still searching
Asking what in this world did I ever find worth in
What could be worse than life of wasted years
Nothing lasting, nothing true, nothing dear
I fear losing beauty in pursuit of bigger things
I fear a broken home courtesy of the American dream
Maybe thatâ€™s just me with my emotions on my sleeve, but one way or another we all wear what we believe

Born, live, strive, succeed
Gain it all, bye, now itâ€™s time to leaveâ€¦
But now, weâ€™re wasting now",Time to Leave

I got treats for your audible
Yup! I know you like what you hear
Treats for your audible

Oh! How enjoyable
Put it in your headphones
Rock it portable
Mono or stereo, let's go
Travel on down to a John Reuben show
So we can build together
Link minds together
Oh, it's so much better to combine the efforts and
Double the impact, double the effect
Twice the energy, twice the sweat
Let's get this thing into full swing
And bring party rockin' a whole new meaning
Ha, smiles teeth white and gleaming
Now are you thinking what I'm thinking?

What may come

A few minutes later look how it evolved
Long as the earth revolves I'll be on call
If you need a emcee, okay, problem solved
I'm there in a heartbeat
Hear my heart speak
Even if I don't ever make the charts peak
That's okay, hey, fact is
I like the simple life and its theatrics
Its everyday madness serves as a reminder that
I'm alive but it's kind of a blur
At least the last 24 and a half years have been
Really no routine or set patt-er-en, so
Who knows what's next in line?

John Reuben,"I tried to communicate, I tried to relate
Now all I want to do is escape and vanish into fantasies
I ventured out of the galaxy into the outer regions
Where folks believe in something
Much, much bigger than their demons

And aren't controlled by their circumstances
Sounds romantic, we'll dance with it slowly
In here my failures don't control me
It's a place of solitude but I'm not lonely
And it's beautiful but let's be reasonable

It's just not real, it just plays with your imagination
And for a moment or two can make time stand still
But when it's over, all you have is a memory
I had to leave 'cause the real world was calling me
I left my youth in pursuit of the truth
And gained a world of dishonesty

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Man, it's sort of overwhelming
It didn't seem like I was storytelling
But you didn't believe me when I told you that I could see
My hopes and dreams come alive as it seems

But there's a time and place for everything
Well, I left my imagination there
Now it's only what I can touch, see, taste and hear
With my natural senses, I wish I could stretch the limits

But my defenses keep me limited from the boundaries I set
So I won't get burned again
Sure, I'd like to be optimistic but that doesn't line up well with reality
So I'll go to sleep now and dream of a younger healthier better me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Don't mistake innocence for ignorance
Don't mistake purity for inexperience
Don't mistake humility for weakness
I sincerely mean this

You understand more than you know
There's no goal like peace of mind
So what else are you trying to find
What's left except regret and heartache

And yes, your heart will break and go numb
Lots of times before this life is done
You'll look for answers but there's just one
Patience, one day it will make sense

But waiting is a pinch waking you up
From the worlds you've made up
The one where you dream
And the one where you gave up time
To create a new atmosphere where
The boy and the cynic can both play fair

",The Boy vs. The Cynic
John Reuben,"They got me pinned against the wall
It's political and predictable
Anything you say will be exaggerated and completely blown out of proportion
Ignore them if you can but I doubt you will
They're out to control how people feel
By pushing their agenda on your subconscious
While you're unaware they start the brainwashing process

Time to call out the unwilling
The ones who need to be cut deep in order to have feeling
You're not used to facing opposition
You've done all the talking now it's time to listen
I understand you wanna make a difference
Well you can start by sticking to your own business
You're an entertaining man trying to be a politician
Stop abusing your position

Follow him, follow them, follow me, follow you, follow who?
Follow your leader!
Do you even know what you're buying into before you
Follow your leader!
It's the blind leading the blind don't be so eager to
Follow your leader!
Know the truth before you try to turn me into a believer and make me
Follow your leader!

Conservative, uptight, right wing, republican
Last time I checked I was none of them
But that's the brush you wanna paint me with taint me with
Some aim to please you aim and miss
A-D-D maybe but I can't tune you out
I would change the station but your signals too loud
(And you're too proud)
To realize you're a moron
Defend what you want whether it's right or wrong
And this applies to both sides of the equation
Arrogant men in power sure are frustrating
On a pedestal you hear them ranting and raving
Proudly proclaiming what they know nothing about
I hear you talkin' loud but I will not allow
Tinseltown to show me how to run my life
Sure you can sing and dance but that don't mean 
You're qualified to give America advice

Follow him, follow them, follow me, follow you, follow who?
Follow your leader!
Do you even know what you're buying into before you
Follow your leader!
It's the blind leading the blind don't be so eager to
Follow your leader!
Know the truth before you try to turn me into a believer and make me

John Reuben,"So here we are in the same old spot
Know that something needs to happen
But our mouths are locked
Tongue tied, closed tight, sewed shut, yup
I tried hard, but it just wouldn't come up

It's on the tip of my tongue
It's in the front of my mind
But the words were still so hard to find
Finally the reality of the things to come
Pushed me to the edge
I jumped off the cliff into the abyss as I said,

I'm not trying to be a nuisance
I just think we can do better than this
That was simply my two cents
You can, you can take it or leave it

The conversation lingered on and on and
Before I knew it night had turned to dawn and
We'll be searching for the truth in all of it, ha
Are we debating just to win the argument?

'Cause none of us want to hear about when we go wrong
This song could easily be from me to you or me to John
'Cause I have to potential to be the guiltiest
My greatest strength is also my greatest weakness

I'm not trying to be a nuisance
I just think we can do better than this
That was simply my two cents
You can, you can take it or leave it

Let's think about this path that we're taking
Let's think about this future we're creating
Let's think about this life that is fading
Think about it, come on
Think about it, now

Let's think about the time that we're spending
Investing in monetary things that are ending
Let's think about it and let's think together and
Let's think about what we can do to make it better

I'm so glad that you could make it tonight
You feel that energy building the atmosphere is so appealing
I'm so glad that you could make it tonight
You can be youself if you're willing it's such a beautiful feeling
I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm so glad

Do you want a little more well alright I'm feeling you
Do you want to make the most out of life I'm feeling you
Are you bored of the same old night I'm feeling you
Each day same day so long goodbye I'm not feeling you

Are you feeling into it yes are you feeling interested of course 
Well meet me at the show seating is unlimited
Never know what's gonna happen Mr. Zappin's got big ideas
Life goes by in the blink of an eye we're gonna take it for all it is
That's just the way it is since the beginning we've been sending signals out
In hopes to contact those who are low and show signs of fear and doubt
Make believers out of skeptics you bet it gets hectic but heck if you get it like suggested
Then I guess it's worth all the work invested just to see you connected.

Do you want a little more well alright I'm feeling you
Do you want to make the most out of life I'm feeling you

John Reuben,"Now it’s in my head 'cause they’re one step ahead
It’s under my skin 'cause it’s a little too thin
And it’s in my heart just to tear me apart

Now you’re feeding off the aggression
Misery loves company and twisted forms of affection
Meet the human heart where hostility lives
Sometimes revenge feels so good that I don’t want to forgive

And oh no, thus the cycle continues
It’s an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Til' they’re all loose and you’re bitter blind and numb
You bark but can’t bite because you’re all gums

And is justice ever done? Are you ever satisfied?
Was it about justification or about pride?
Stay away from the truth, it might teach you things you don’t like
My insecurity is out to prove that I’m right

I don’t want your apologies, I don’t want restitution
I want to hear you’re wrong but I don’t want resolutions
I want justice but I don’t care for peace
I don’t want to be bound but I don’t choose to be free
I want for you what I feel inside of me
And as soon as I know what that is I’ll share willingly

It seems like it should be simpler
But the human condition runs from wisdom
And we’re not as bright as we give ourselves credit
We repeat the same mistakes before we can regret it

I tried to let it go but it held me in place
There’s something better but I don’t like the taste
Bitterness is easier to swallow than the sting of grace
Memories can be neglected but impossible to erase

They reappear in different ways
And most of the time we’re not even sure of what it is that we hate
We just follow our feelings into an unhealthy state
Of being with no plans of leaving

I don’t want your apologies, I don’t want restitution
I want to hear you’re wrong but I don’t want resolutions
I want justice but I don’t care for peace
I don’t want to be bound but I don’t choose to be free
I want for you what I feel inside of me
And as soon as I know what that is I’ll share willingly

If I let this go then it’s all in the past
And if I hold onto it I still have something to grasp
What would we do if we had nothing to fight about?
Out of the abundance, out our hearts, we run our mouths
And tear each other apart and inflict pain and grief

Humanity wouldn’t know what to do if we had world peace
So you can take the sign in your front lawn down, it’s a nice gesture
But mankind likes to go to our war, it’s in our fallen nature
Neighbors, nations, corporations, races insecurity
And hurt works well with retaliation

But don’t worry, it will be your turn soon
So plot your revenge as you clean your knife wound
And 'I forgive you' is not an option, it’s too uncomfortable
It’s much easier to be miserable than vulnerable
You can save that for the weak and the religious
But there is no justice or no peace, there’s only forgiveness

And thank the Lord for all you have 
But what about them? 
Did you forget about them? 

We came we conquered never speak of this again 
Life Must go on let’s not think of them 
Things are comfortable now the pioneers have settled in 
A perfect blend of progress and pale skin 
For our sake and those to come 
We’ll rewrite the text so you can forget where you came from 
Tell it in a way that will build your self esteem 
Repackage the product and sell the American dream

Floats around the universe 
The United States is His favorite place on the whole entire earth 
So sing your songs and wave your flag 
And thank the Lord for all you have 
But what about them? 
Did you forget about them? 

History is best forgotten and even better rewritten 
And since there’s no forgetting let’s remember it different 
Commit to it so strongly till you believe it 
The truth is there but you aren’t able to receive it 
You need to know you’re safe here 
Hide your face here 'cause you found your faith here 
But four walls with no windows doesn’t mean you’re it 
Four walls with no windows doesn’t mean they don’t exist

So sing your songs and wave your flag 
And thank the Lord for all you have 
But what about them? 
Did you forget about them?  

What a prosperous, wondrous place 
Remember to say grace before we scrape our plates 
And ignore the crying outside the door sure 
You’ll pray for their burdens but you don’t want to make it yours 
Thin lines divide but there’s a world of difference 
So crawl back into your happy existence and feel the bliss of ignorance keep you warm 
Blessed are those who mourn but it’s so foreign 
The more you have the less you care 
The less you care the more you become unaware 
And sure life’s not fair but it favors us apparently 
And how are we to interpret this excess 
Is it God’s favor ill-behavior or simply man’s modern progress 
God bless us as we sweep this mess under the rug 
Don’t want to walk barefoot on the tile and step in the mud 
Out of sight out of mind and pushed to the side 
Left for someone else to rationalize and justify 

Puff the magic Jesus 
Floats around the universe 
The United States is His favorite place on the whole entire earth 
So sing your songs and wave your flag 
And thank the Lord for all you have

John Reuben,"As fast as the world is changing
It’s hard to find anything amazing
Take away the mystery
Find some comfort in the routine
We can’t control what’s behind the scenes

Old men swap conspiracies
Anything to keep it interesting
I believe it all now, faith is risky
Smart enough to confuse myself
How stupid, better get used to it

Both clarity and confusion
Are part of the movement
Open me up, shut me down
Silence is the sweetest sound
Close my mouth and think out loud
I’m in the real world now

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

I know in part, see in part
Spent a lot of time in the dark
Lost in the options
Now I’m listening with caution

Somewhere between imagination and fear
Unsure of what I’m trying to hear
I don’t trust loud and clear
Put a still small voice in my ear

Whisper to me quietly
So I can figure it out
Honestly avoiding noise pollution
And easy to use conclusions

Because some things
Weren’t meant to be spelled out
Still it’s the simple things that count
Close my mind and think out loud
I’m in the real world now

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

Superstition, true religion
The near truth can’t tell the difference
Beautifully written contradictions
Spoken with such conviction

I’ve held a lot of conversations
With well thought out exaggerations
Thin line between insanity and insight
Better hope you’re right

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

John Reuben,"It was different back then
Anything could happen
Ideas as big as your fantasies could imagine
Children practicing that's part of getting older
Impatiently waiting for time to move forward

Optimistic youngins running on adrenaline
At the center of the universe begging for your attention
Making a difference meant looking important
No heroes were made that day
How unfortunate
Came and went like adolescence
Took our wind and left us restless
Now we want the wind that kept us alive and feeling refreshed
They said it was of the essence
To us time wasn't precious
There it goes now try and catch it
Watch it go

And the world around me was no longer wonderful
I can't give back your influence
Perspective is hard to undo
Thank you for the experience...

Here's some anxiety to keep you company
As you waste your energy trying to build your legacy
Tell me what more can a man do than eat, drink, and enjoy his toil
I want to be casual but taking it easy is too stressful
Anticipation now a days looks a lot more like anxious
Time killed away our imaginations
We used to escape into fantasies and fairytales

Wait to be seen staring at the big screen
One day folks is gonna know me
Hopefully sing my songs at karaoke
I’m thinking positive

Even if it’s fashionable to be the pessimist
Skipped out of style, went straight to vintage
Can I get a yes? Y'all from all the naysayers
Listen to me now or catch up to me later
Do the kids still say player haters?

I’m sorry, I forgot the disclaimers
I was told not to be so defensive
Man, was I offended
Put a mic into the crowd
Help me out now finish the sentence

I’ll make the music if you make it look good
I don’t dance but I think that you should

Good evening's a greeting
Goodnight is farewell

There’s a story to tell, I’m at a lost for words
Can I borrow yours? You could speak for yourself
Or ask a ghostwriter for help, I need a story to tell
To be a has been, you have to have been
On a porch swing reminiscing poor decisions

Should have done it different
Fist full of accomplishments
Slipping through your fingertips
Opportunities missed
Fifteen minutes goes quick

Off your seat and on your feet
Half full or a half empty drink
Work the room, gunshot wink
Party people in the place to be

John Reuben,"Make money, money, make money, money
Save money, money, save money, money

Left high school at sixteen, pick an identity
Entrepreneurial dreams, find yourself a strategy
Next Saturday the class of '97 is graduating
In a couple of years, I’ll grab a G.E.D

As for now we’ll just make ends meet
Put our art in the place where it’s forced to succeed
The place where your hobbies and the real world meet
Forty minute walks to work to bus tables full time

With a pair of headphones on to block out traffic going by
Forty back to make music all night
With a pair of headphones on to block out my life
Open mic nights, let the spit fly

A hundred hands reaching for the chance to try
And maybe I grew up a bit too quick
It can’t be all about the music, admit it

So if you make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

It goes fast
(Goes fast)
No cash
(No cash)

We used to shop discount racks for brand name specials
Mix and match designer scraps to look presentable
Hated on those who appeared more successful
Sloppy and broke became the look because it was affordable

Before it was fashionable
Now kids pay good money to look poor
And get charged for the extra work
Of perfectly placed character
Isn’t that some irony? Expensively indie

Make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

It goes fast
(Goes fast)
No cash

I was told security with a cushion, just in case
How can I plan for the future if I can’t afford today?
Rap's a game that mostly amateurs play
And there are very few professionals that are getting paid

Go on there indie rappers and find your shtick
Throw it up against the wall and pray that it sticks
We used to say no gimmicks but everybody’s got one
No gimmicks, mine is that I’ve got none

Lost the truth, marketing honesty
The rap game is a sport of psychology
Underdogs go where they find opportunity
While spoiled children romanticize poverty

So if you make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

John Reuben,"Inconsistent, my feelings change quicker
Than I can get the words out and tell you what I’m thinking
Inconsistent, I don’t have much grace or patience
I hold this grudge and my tongue no further statements

It plays out in my mind
All the lost words I could have used to describe
And even though it’s left such a bad taste in my mouth
I guess I’d rather swallow my pride than spit it out

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was listening
Everyone was interested

Failure cuts the spirit to hear
That’s why I have to let my pride interfere
I’ll take it from there
If you see me acting differently, don’t worry

That’s just me, dialoging with me internally
About the hypothetical over analytical, still what do I know
Central Ohio’s gray skies provide a lot of time to be stuck inside
Close the world out, introvert's paradise

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was interested
Everyone was listening

It’s that wishy washy, topsy turvy monotony
I’ve been here before both emotionally and logically
You know that you know until the wind blows
It’s as easy as no and as hard as no

People pleasers never win, spread yourself too thin
It’s best to just do what you feel in the end
But you’ll change how you feel for the sake of the truth
When the world you’re living in becomes bigger than you

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was interested

What could be more brilliant than to just play dumb?
(Hey)

Sing it like you mean it
(C'mon, c'mon)
Make me believe it
(C'mon, c'mon)

Dream like you own it
(C'mon, c'mon)
The party ain’t stopping
The party ain’t

Sing it like you mean it
(C'mon, c'mon)
Make me believe it
(C'mon, c'mon)

Dream like you own it
(C'mon, c'mon)
The party ain’t stopping
Until we’ve outgrown it

Roaring twenties, depressed at thirty
Busy bodies move with urgency
I put my ear to the street
Somebody catch me up to speed
I want to win but I don’t want to compete

Take the good with the bad
Chew the meat, spit the fat
Own some land, pay the tax
Mini van with two and a half

Raise your glass, toast to past
It all happened a little too fast
Passionate about what you can’t get back

Sing it like you mean it
(C'mon, c'mon)
Make me believe it
(C'mon, c'mon)

Dream like you own it
(C'mon, c'mon)
The party ain’t stopping
The party ain’t

Sing it like you mean it
(C'mon, c'mon)
Make me believe it
(C'mon, c'mon)

Dream like you own it

The party ain’t stopping
Until we've outgrown it

John Reuben,"Oh buddy, the freaks come out at night
Till they can no longer afford to socialize
Ha, I left the party early, what’s wrong with me?
I’m at the diner down the corner on my fifth cup of coffee

Pen in hand, trying to recreate that feeling
Staring at the ceiling, make them think that your thinking
Cigarettes and aspirin, thoughts on a napkin
Wadded up in the trash can asking

Oh, what happened to your imagination?
Let’s dance this night away
Everyone of us is born a genius
Until we got too cool to play

I said you’re trying too hard, you must not know who you are
It’s not natural, you look uncomfortable
You’re trying too hard, you must not know who you are
It’s not natural, relax a little

One for the drinks, two for the tip
Three for rent, the rest is for the government
Work all day, spend it in the evening
Overpriced drinks, room full of needy friends

Are we having a good time? Absolutely, who wouldn’t be?
You can introduce me to the moody cuties
And dudes who act like I’m supposed to know, they should be
Well, I don’t nor do I care
Stop trying so hard and put both hands up in the air

You must not know who you are, it’s not natural
You look uncomfortable, you’re trying too hard
You must not know who you are
It’s not natural, relax a little

If the kids all leave we’ll shut the place down
But until then let’s go another round
I said until then let’s go another round
Who are these kids causing disorderly conduct?

Telemarketers and bus boys trying to tear the club up
Getting rowdy, rowdy
Hey man, I ain't gonna front
If the DJ plays my record, that’s exactly what I want

Oh, what happened to your imagination
Let’s dance this night away
Everyone of us is born a genius
Until we got too cool to play

You must not know who you are, it’s not natural
You look uncomfortable, you’re trying too hard
You must not know who you are
It’s not natural, relax a little

",Trying Too Hard
John Reuben,"Put it out there ask for it adamantly passionate
With a fist in the air like an activist
Y'all need a little bit of happiness
The world’s mad enough as is, you want realistic?

This is entertainment, we decorate it
We can hide away and make a day of it
Got a lot of information, what good can you do with it?
Telling us what the real world isn’t
Doesn’t make you any more in it

I believe good things can happen
Sing along as the world’s collapsing
Crack a smile in good fashion
Take a break from the action

Universal, it’s a small world
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal

Y'all need to move to it, do it, don’t play stupid
You get your hands in the atmos, go on ahead and clap those
This goes out to those who know
How to let go and enjoy the show
From down the road to around the globe

What little we know I’m willing to let go, breathe slow
Optimist in a moshpit
Sit down on top of the world with a good view to watch it
Organize the chaotic
Talk to God like it’s obvious
None of which consists of politics or the apocalypse

Universal, it’s a small world
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal

The night is yours to enjoy, give us what we came here for
Love builds pride destroys, lift your voice and make some noise
Picket signs protest justice for the oppressed
It all feels pretty hopeless, take a moment to catch your breath

Feet on the floor, music in the air
Reality will still be there for you when the song is through
Twenty four seven breaking news
This just in but I’m not paying attention
Ignorance isn’t bliss but taking a break from it is

Universal, it’s a small world
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal

John Reuben,"I can't hear what you're saying
Just keep the music playing
It all sounds the same to me

Good God please have mercy
Let's kick the machine till it's working
Everybody's got a great idea
Do you own the one you're encouraging
There's a first time for everything
After that it starts to get confusing
Hold onto your identities loosely
At least the revolution will be amusing

[Chorus]
Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
So you can tell somebody to tell somebody
That the next new thing is the same old thing

We came and we quickly left
We took what we could get
I guess we weren't impressed
We bored ourselves instead
What's after what's next
What's left to get off your chest
Walking in circles retracing steps
How many ways can we package the concept
Mundane it's all the same
Remind me later when nothing's changed
Time will tell let the future explain
Until then we''ve got history to make
Trend-setters real go-getters
Closed-minded free-thinking hipsters
Instant classics adored by critics
It's just music for the kids

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
So you can tell somebody to tell somebody that
What''s happening has already happened again

Of course you've heard this before
What are you trying to figure out
Too much time on your hands
To analyze what doesn't count
What's wrong with everyday people
They make the best crowd
It was never that important
And the future doesn't care about your

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
So you can tell somebody to tell somebody
That what's happening has already happened again

John Reuben,"Let your yes be yeah

We're on fire
On fire burning bridges
We don't have plans on
Crossing back again
Come on and spell it out
Put the words in our mouth
If it is what it is easy listening
Come and
Be quick in few words or less

Nah nah, nah nah nah nah

Take this line off the song
Put it on a bumper sticker

Black and white gave grey an ultimatum
Conversation interrupted
Open to interpretation
End of discussion
Hold on to the stereotype then bring it back
When it's time to say I told you so look how they act
Come on play it cool dance around act a fool
Try and build a case off the exception to the rule

John Ricci,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

John Rich,"Sometimes when I sleep
I can see you walking back to me

We saw a home and a family and all the things
