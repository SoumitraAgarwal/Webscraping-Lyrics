Mandy Moore,"There is part of me that wants an answer
And part of me that doesn't want to know
Part of you that I am in love with
And the part that I am willing to let go

This is a delicate unraveling
Now and then I find pieces on the floor
Tiny little bits that tell me
Maybe I shouldn't do this
Or love you anymore

Someone's gonna have to fess up
Someone's gonna have to clean this mess up

[Chorus:]
'Cause I wanted you the first time
And I loved you from the second
And I don't know how that ever goes away
As far as I can tell
You're really good at talking
So I think its time you let me know
I'm just your latest mistake

I wonder what will make you happy
I wonder what you'll do with it all
I have a map in my head
Somehow still don't understand
Why I always have to miss you
Why I have to make the call

Someone's gonna have to step up
Someone's gonna have to clean this mess up

[Chorus]

Before you drive me away
Take a good look at me, baby
Picture me not lying on your couch
I wish the best for you
Everytime you go through this
Before you finally figure it out

[Chorus]

Oh, I'm your latest mistake",Latest Mistake
Mandy Moore,"Drove to your house in the hills
Where I wanted to be
The lights were all on
And I knew you were waiting for me
And that road became familiar
Like the mystery shape of your heart

[Chorus:]
And I know you loved me in your way
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
And I'm fine, but I'm not OK
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days

The fog in the morning clouded the world that we knew
It was almost enough being lonely and living for you
And the rain came to our window
And I wish I could've stayed

[Chorus]

Let it go
Let it go sunshine
Now you know
Now you know it's time
It's time

You were asleep while I gathered my things in the dark
The burns on my fingers were all that was left of the spark
Didn't want to wake you
'Cause I knew I couldn't say

[Chorus]

I'm looking forward to looking back on these days",Looking Forward to Looking Back
Mandy Moore,"I'm not ready to confront
I'd rather cement my words this way
This could be the easy road out
But I'm just not all that happy
So I'm writing all this down
And I'll file it in a drawer someday
In lieu of a conversation
We'd probably forget to have anyway

[Chorus:]
I won't hold anything back
And I won't hold anything in
Feel like I know where this is going
And I might know how it ends
But I'm still
Willing to begin

You should know my story by now
And why I'm optimistic cautiously
I understand it's not your fault
But I'm not takin' anything back
You still end up with
Most of me

[Chorus]

I expect you to fly from N.Y. to L.A.
And land on my doorstep
And smile at me and say
It was worth it to see most of me
Do you love most of me?

You're just crossing paths
With the way he left me
I'm not sayin' a word
But I'm watching you quietly
'Cause you're gonna have to prove me wrong
Before I know this is right
We don't have to decide tonight
Just wait for me patiently
And you'll get all of me

[Chorus]

Yeah I'm still
Willing to begin",Most of Me
Mandy Moore,"Somebody told me, they saw you somewhere
Somebody hold me, 'cause suddenly I'm a little, cold
Well I must be mistaken you for somebody else
I know you all to well, or do I?

[Chorus:]
I heard you say
We were one and the same
Well wrong again
I could never do those things you did to me
I will be OK
In time you'll fade
Into the nothing that you are
The nothing you are

Somebody sold me, yeah the same old story
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Hadn't you told me, you were there the whole time
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Well I must be mistaken you for somebody else
I hope you burn in hell, or do I?

[Chorus]

I know your mistakes will hunt you down, eventually
You'll know that when you hit the ground
Your weakness did you in, and dealt me out
It's OK, I have the truth on my side

I heard you say
We were one and the same
We'll wrong again
I could never do those things, you did to me
I will be OK
In time you'll fade
Into nothing that you are
The nothing you are
The nothing you are
The nothing you are
The nothing you are",Nothing That You Are
Mandy Moore,"I'm a long way off
But I'm still around
Sitting on the couch
I'm watching you
And if I take my time
All the others give in
You feel like you're standing in line
Oh no, no, no

I just know that you're worth the wait
It's of no concern
It's a risk I'd gladly take
From time to time

[Chorus:]
Don't worry about yourself at all
I'll hang your work up on my wall
Hose you down and dress you up real nice
With some brand new plans and a fancy car
Try to place your superstar
'Cause you can tell the story of your life
Without slummin' in paradise

I wonder how you feel
Or do I?
Standing on the corner
How's your view?
From the other side
Oh, Mr. Right
Its not a pretty sight alone

[Chorus]

You won't often see this letter
Handed over right away
I know the first time I found you wonderful

[Chorus]

Without slummin'
Slummin' in paradise
Slummin' in paradise",Slummin' in Paradise
Mandy Moore,"In the crazy world
Anything can happen
If you will it to
I'm just a hazy girl
Blurring all the edges
Only seeing blue

[Chorus:]
It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright

Lost inside
A painting of a city on a hotel wall
Days goes by
Wasting golden hours in the fall

[Chorus]

I catch a glimpse of our reflection
Beside you I see myself
We are the season's new collection
We look like everybody else

Walk alone
Through the crowded streets into the fading grey
Here and gone
Like a decoration for the holiday

[Chorus]

Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright",Wild Hope
Mandy Moore,"All good things
All good things
All good things

Not sure where to go
Everybody I know
Says I'm too forgiving
And now that I'm wrong
I don't wanna move on
I just keep reliving

All good things
I wish you
All good things
Come to an end
All good things
I wish you well

Lost inside of my head
Empty side of the bed
I fill this place without you
I keep pushing the blues
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What I loved about you

All good things
I wish you
All good things
Come to an end
All good things
I wish you well

I could think of a million ways
You proved you weren't the one for me
To live inside of your shades of grey
And never mind the sunshine that I'll find

I got so much space now
I got a whole house
With the wind blowin' through
I don't need someone to hide
I got this whole world inside
I was accustomed to showing you

Mandy Moore,"What would happen if I flew to San Francisco
Wouldn't make much sense
From the outside looking in
Coming around again

All the answers
Far too many questions
All the thing we said
Never really put to bed
Coming around again

You know I love you
What am I supposed to do
You're so far away
I stay on track
You're all over the map
Come back to L.A.

You know I love you
What am I supposed to do
I've been here before
I stay on track
You're all over the map
Come back to New York

Is this the only way for us to communicate
I put it in a song
Didn't really take too long
Coming around again
Coming around again",Bug
Mandy Moore,"Love doesn't come alone, now does it?
Present perfect tense
So you made yourself a little world
Where even strangers make more sense
I play the pain upright, straight ahead

You can ease yourself into the light
Or keep that record on repeat

What if I loved you
What if I loved you
What if I loved you
Everblue, Everblue

Following the sleepless hours
Unsubtle dreams will make you cave
You can paint them all your brilliant colors
Just don't fall off into the deep

Happiness is not a burden
Oh how the pendulum will swing
I have felt the ground
I've seen the seeds
Out of which grew golden wings

What if I loved you
What if I loved you
What if I loved you
Everblue, Everblue

High above the stars are dancing
To a song one bird is singing
And it's you my Everblue

Even piece it together whenever you ripped it apart
But I can never be that kind of girl who absorbs that kind of suffering
And turns it into some kind of verb

I want to two way conversations
I want love to love me back

I want love to love me back

Mandy Moore,"Restless to Begin.
A wave comes crashing in.
The band on stage is tuning.
Jararandends are blooming.
Your face sketched in my dreams.
Puts my mind at ease.
Beneath the water frozen.
The Merrimack River is flowing.
Under Rolling.
Over.

[Chorus:]
Don't say you're not amazed when you know you are.
Don't say you're not afraid when you know you are.
Rows of boys and girls run out to seek the world.
Candy coated promise.
Just out of reach when you want it.

Give me something sweet.
Bring me to the brink.
I'll leave without hesitation.
To a world without limitation.
Rock me patient.
Slowly.

Don't say you're not amazed when you know you are.
Don't say you're not afraid when you know you are.
You know you are.

A world that moves too fast.
A mouth of broken glass.
It may not seem so painful.
By January, the rain will swallow.
Change will follow.

Don't say you're not afraid when you know you are.

Tired of hiding
Went a little late last night
But do you know how it feels
Under the wheels turning in the back of my mind

We have both been wrong before
Even though my heart is torn
I only want the best for you

Tell me a story
Saturday morning has brought a break in the clouds
Before the thunder and rain
Start up again
I want to let it all out

We have both been wrong before
And even though my heart is torn
I only want the best for you

You break the walls around me and take away my pain
If you can do this for me
Oh baby, you can do it for yourself

Out of rotation
Part of the process of building

In the darkest of nights, out on thin ice
I'll always be there for you

Mandy Moore,"Now I am walking on my own two feet.
The sun is shining.
My shadow is stretched across the street.
And I meet the eyes of the stranger, I can't quite place him but I wouldn't replace him.
For a second or a minute or an hour of the day.

I turn the corner, I was feeling good.
All the birds are humming, all the bees are buzzing.
And the trees and the leaves,
Looked a little bit greener.
And the air felt cleaner.
Yeah, I've must been dreaming.
For a second or a minute
But maybe that's okay.

Hey, come on let's play a song.
Two or three or four.
Five or if you want more.
Or maybe you got somewhere else to be.

Be, whoever you want to be!
Whatever you want to see.
Whatever you want to see.

I was awoken by the morning light.
My heart felt happy, I was quiet ready.
For the makeup or breakup.
Another good reason,
One that is pleasing.
In the world without season.
Cause the truth is not pretty when it hits you in the face.

Hey, come on let's play a song.
Two or three or four.
Five or if you want more.
Or maybe you got somewhere else to be.

Hey, come on let's play a song.

Mandy Moore,"Could I close the door behind me
And lock myself outside alone?
Could somebody please remind me
Why this bird still hasn't still flown
To a treetop on the mountainside
Or joined an arrow in the sky
I know, I know someday I will be home

To many dreams of my house burning
Where I'm the one who struck the match
Try to find the meaning
A life on fire, a bird a will hatch
To a treetop on the mountainside
Or join an arrow in the sky
I know, I know someday I will be home

Oh I am not afraid of alone
No I am not afraid of my own missteps
There's no regrets
At least not yet
Not yet

Took a bus across the country
My bags were full, they weighed me down
And on that trail to California
Shed my skin in every town
To a treetop on the mountainside
And joined an arrow in the sky
I know, I know finally found a home
I know, I know finally found a home
For now
A home

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun

Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock

And the parlor lamps begin to glow

No more tests
Comes the day you say, 'What for?'

No more feelings. Time to shut the door

Free from the ties that bind
No more despair, or burdens to bear
Out there in the yonder
Running away, go to it

Have to take care unless there's a 'where'
You'll only be wandering blind
Just more questions different kind
Where are we to go?
Where are we ever to go?
Running away, we'll do it
Why sit around, resigned?
Trouble is, son, the farther you run
The more you'll be wandering blind
For what you have left undone, and more
What you've left behind
We disappoint, we leave a mess, we die, but we don't

We disappoint in turn, I guess. Forget, though, we won't
Like father, like son
No more giants waging war
Can't we just pursue our lives, with our children and our wives
'Till that happy day arrives, how do you ignore

All the wolves, all the lies, the false hopes, the good-bye's
The reverses
All the wondering what even worse is still in store

All the giants

I walk right up and say
 
Please play for me

There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing

From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest 
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing 
Just Doodle doo-doo it
I love it so  
Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo

Mandy Patinkin,"Before you leave these portals
To meet less fortunate mortals
There's just one final message
I would give to you
You all have learned reliance
On the sacred teachings of science
So I hope, through life you never will decline
In spite of philistine
Defiance
To do what all good scientists do

Experiment
Make it your motto day and night
Experiment
And it will lead you to the light
The apple on the top of the tree
Is never too high to achieve
So take an example from Eve

Be curious
Though interfering friends may frown,
Get furious
At each attempt to hold you down
If this advice you'll only employ
The future can offer you infinite joy
And merriment

And you'll see",Experiment
Mandy Patinkin,"It started out like a song, we started quiet and slow with no surprise,
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going.
It's not that nothing went wrong, some angry moment of course, but just a few,
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going.

And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake?
Half the time you never wanted enough, oh wake up, I don't make that a crime,
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away,
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on growing,
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone.

Mandy Patinkin,"Well, if not, he's got inner beauty
And I dream of a place
Where we could be together at last
A matchbox of our own
A fence of real chain link
A grill out on the patio
Disposal in the sink
A washer and a dryer and an ironing machine
In a tract house that we share
Somewhere that's green

He rakes and trims the grass
He loves to mow and weed
I cook like Betty Crocker
And I look like Donna Reed
There's plastic on the furniture
To keep it neat and clean
In the Pine-Sol scented air
Somewhere that's green

Between our frozen dinner
And our bedtime, nine-fifteen
We snuggle watchin' Lucy
On our big, enormous twelve-inch screen
I'm his December Bride
He's Father, he Knows Best
Our kids watch Howdy Doody
As the sun sets in the west

Far from Skid Row
I dream we'll go

I'll drop now before we fade
Mother, you watch while I revise the world

Changing as we sit here
Quiet all, Georgia
Sundays disappearing as we look, look
You make it beautiful

Oh Georgia, how I long for the old view
",Beautiful
Mandy Patinkin,"Mademoiselles
You end me, pal
Second bottle
Ah, she looks for me

Bonnet flapping
Yapping
Ruff
Chicken
Pastry

Yes, she looks for me good
Let her look for me
To tell me why she left me
As I always knew she would

I had thought she understood
They have never understood
And no reason that they should

But if anybody could, finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go

Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky
And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light

How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""
But the women who won't wait for you knows
That, however you live

There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat
Look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat

",Finishing the Hat
Mandy Patinkin,"I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot
Swimming weightless in the womb
Bouncing gently round the room
In a minute I'll be free
And we'll be splashing in the sea

I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me
In a minute I'll be free
And we'll be splashing in the sea
We hear a tiny cry
As the ship goes sliding by

Free!
Free!

Free!
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel free!

Mandy Patinkin,"Green finch and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird
How is it you sing?
How can you jubilate, singing in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside, the sky waits, beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars
How can you remain , staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?
Green finch and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody, constantly flowing?
Is it rejoicing or merely hallowing?
Are you discussing or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing? Are you screaming?
Ringdove and robinet, is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided, it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms, damask and dark
Nothing there sings, not even a lark
Larks never will, you know, when they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive, ah

Green finch, and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird
Teach me how to sing
If I cannot fly
Let me sing
",Green Finch and Linnet Bird

Mandy Patinkin,"Live alone and like it, free as the birds in the trees
High above the briars, live alone and like it doing whatever you please
When your heart desires, free to hang around or fly at any old time

No equivocation, most of all no guarantees
That can be your motto, free of obligation, only the murmuring breeze
As an obligato, live alone and like it, why is that such a crime?

Free to call the tune, free to say if you're gonna work or play
You can have the moon but you don't have to have it night and day

Anyway, on your own with only you to concern yourself
Doesn't mean you're lonely, just that you're free
Live and alone and like it, don't come down from that tree

Hear the jokes, have a smoke, and a laugh at the clown
In a whirl, see a girl with a smile in her eyes
Never thought I'd be brought right down by her lies

In a trance, watch her dance to the beat of the drums
Faster now, sweating brow, I'm all the fingers and thumbs
Wonder why I hit the sky when she blows me a kiss
In a while, run a mile, I'm regretting all this

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end

There's only one thing you should know

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Pretty Flamingo [Saturday Club Recorded 19/4/66]

I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I watch your sea birds flying

It's not your lungs this time

Don't give me my money back
Don't want it anymore

And I've rammed through all your doors

Not much longer would you be mine, baby

Do you plan to let me go

Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground

Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

Slicked back injustice sits nicely next to smiles
Paranoia at the heels of too much greed
Obedience an art form while the sad bleed

Success and love dictate while skin touches fashion
Consumerism beauty for cheap appeal
I don't wanna dance for people to watch
Smother my life in interest accounts

Outside life brings down genocide
And consumer self-hate leads to designer bullshit
Hate is art and we steal cars
Decaying flowers in the playground of the rich

You can launch sweetly and say nice things
But I ain't ever on the way up
My only way is down on disease that tries to suffocate
The pure ideals that turn to hate

Manna,"There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
And those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

And stars in your multitudes
Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind wrong
I will never rest
And just to share
It's pleasures and belong
It's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day, till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars
By the stars
By the stars

Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down upon your fellow man",Stars

Mannarino,"Questa è una storia
Da raccontare

Può andare bene
Può andare male

Ma non si sa
Qual'è il finale

Bisogna andare
Comunque andare
A camminare
Sulla terrazza 
Con vista mondo
Dove ogni alba 
È anche un tramonto

Il mondo è un'Arca di Noè
Che va perduta alla deriva
Ma se sei qui con me il mondo non c’è
C’è solo pioggia estiva
Perso dentro te come nel mare una sardina
Vago nell’eternità
E sto qua giù, dentro una stradina

E questa vita mia è tutto quel che ho

Questa è una storia da raccordare
T’ho vista urlare, piccola vita
Poi ritornare con una vita
Lasciare al mondo un nuovo nome
Una vendetta, una speranza
O forse solo un po’ d’amore 
E il carburante del motore dell’astronave 

Il mondo è un'Arca di Noè 
Che va perduta alla deriva 
Ma se sei qui con me il mondo non c’è 
C’è una galassia estiva

Una folla più grossa dell'altra decise il da fare
E venne il tempo che questo paese fu di un solo colore
Una riga più dritta dell'altra chiuse il confine

Con una gamba più zoppa dell'altra provammo a fuggire
Con la pelle di un altro colore mischiammo le vene
Trovati, battuti e portati sopra un campo di neve
E il sangue cadendo sembrò dello stesso colore

Fu per paura dell'esecuzione o per il dolore
Che con un braccio più freddo dell'altro stringevo il mio amore
Lei mi disse ""Sei freddo, fra le mie gambe c'è ancora calore""
Cominciammo a fare l'amore davanti ai soldati
Lei disse, tremando ""Che vedano come son nati
Che vedano gli esseri umani come son nati""
Con gli occhi negli occhi dell'altro andammo a vedere
Due lastre di ghiaccio lasciate dalla bufera
Improvvisamente travolte dai primi raggi della primavera

Il soldato più orbo dell'altro prese a mirare
E quello più monco dell'altro era pronto a sparare
Ma il soldato più muto di tutti si mise a parlare

Si lamentano l'uno con l'altro, son tutti contorti
Ecco che cadono a terra, guardate, son morti""

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
'Peace on the earth, good will to men,'
From heav'n's all-gracious King.
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing!

Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long,
Beneath the angel strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love song which they bring:
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing!

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurl'd;
And still their heav'nly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hov'ring wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

All ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look, now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

For lo! the days are hast'ning on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing!",It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

Mannheim Steamroller,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may his His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

And the bank account nigga filled wit so many o's
Nobody rush me off, nigga dust me off

Jam hoes in lambo's outside of the club

Pimpin sew it where you show it nigga fresh and so clean

The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream
All too soon

All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there
What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring
And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything

You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try
For we whispered goodbye
All too soon
Too soon",All Too Soon
Manny Albam,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Manny Albam,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

Will you ask the one outside to take your place?

Manny Manuel,"Es noche y en su cuarto el sueño del primer amor esta escapándose 
Lloro y en su almohada lo encontró en cada lagrima alejándose 
Miro por la ventana esperando encontrar una estrellita 
Y hacerle su pedido para que el de la abandone y no la deje tan solita 

Estrellita dile por favor que es muy joven para preocuparse 
Dile que esa penas de la vida y con el tiempo va a volver a enamorarse 
Estrellita dile por favor cuéntale que hay rosas en la vida 
Que nos dan un día su perfume y otro dia ellas mismas te lastiman 

Yo se sera difícil resignarse a perder a su primer amor 
Que va a pasar el tiempo y muy adentro seguirá sintiendo un gran dolor 
Y llegara a pensar que su pedido no ha escuchado la estrellita 
Y llorara muy triste porque el la ha abandonado y la ha dejado tan solita 

Estrellita dile por favor que es muy joven para preocuparse 
Dile que esa penas de la vida y con el tiempo va a volver a enamorarse 
Estrellita dile por favor cuéntale que hay rosas en la vida 
Que nos dan un día su perfume y otro día ellas mismas te lastiman",Estrellita
Manny Manuel,"Cuando te perdí no me conformé con la realidad
Un presentimiento en mi pensamiento me dió la verdad
La humilde casita que fué nuestro nido muy triste quedó
Solo tu perfume quedó en el recuerdo de aquel gran amor

Tu procedimiento me hizo padecer
Dejando en mi pecho una herida cruel
A verte rendida por otra ilusión
De celos y angustias mataste mi amor

Dicen que los hombres no deben llorar 
Por una mujer que ha pagado mal 
Pero yo no pude contener mi llanto 
Cerrando los ojos me puse a llorar
Pero yo no pude contener mi llanto
Cerrando los ojos me puse a llorar
Dicen que los hombres no deben llorar 
Por una mujer que ha pagado mal 
Pero yo no pude contener mi llanto 
Cerrando los ojos me puse a llorar

Dejando en mi pecho una herida cruel
A verte rendida por otra ilusión
De celos y angustias mataste mi amor

Manny Manuel,"Me dejaste jugar a quererte
Me dejaste apostarme la vida
Me dejaste creerme que me amabas
Y un buen día dejaste de ser mía

Y empecé a recorrer otros caminos
Y me ví enredado en otros brazos
Me llené de perfume de otros cuerpos
Y probé la dulzura de otros labios

De nuevo me enseñas la baraja
Y me retas a una última partida
En tu juego tan solo hay una carta
Y yo tengo las mismas que tenía

Ay, ay no llores 
Que afortunadamente se te acabó la suerte 
Y yo seguiré siendo el rey de corazones
Ay, ay no llores 
Que afortunadamente te tengo nuevamente 
Y yo seré por siempre tu rey de corazones

Ya cumpliste tu amarga penitencia
Con llanto lavaste tus pecados
Y yo también he aprendido a perdonarte
Y no olvido lo mucho que te he amado

Volveremos a ser lo que antes fuimos
Volveremos al mundo del pasado
Pero nunca, nunca, nunca, nunca olvides
Que yo cedo después de haber ganado

Y si quieres rompamos la baraja
Que a los dos nos ha tenido separados 
Y vivamos completamente unidos
Para nunca jamás hacernos daño

Y tú me dejaste creerme que me amabas
Y tu aroma yo buscaba en otro cuerpo en otra cama

Ay los dos juntitos y de nuevo amarnos 
Dándonos caricias sin hacernos daño",Rey de Corazones

Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?
Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herido

Viste en mi un aprendiz de galán que quisiste atrapar

Con marcada malicia tu cuerpo se entregaba a mi cuerpo
Preparando el terreno inventabas alargar tu jugada 
Y ya vez que en tu propia maraña te quedaste enredada

Te creías la reina del cielo por tus dones de vuelo 
Te encontrabas tan segura de mí que hasta me hacías sufrir 
Y ahora vez que tu cruel vanidad se te ha vuelto dolor 
Y ahora debes saber la verdad ya no quiero tu amor

Que yo me enamoré

Lo que tú me quisiste

Ay, detendré mi camino
En un pueblo lejano y allí moriré

Sé que ya no me quieres

No monkey ever deserted his wife
Nor her baby and ruin her life
I said yeah, monkey speaks his mind

And let all the coconuts go to waist
Forbidding all other monkeys to come and taste
Now if I build a fence around this tree

Starvation will cause you to steal from me

Now don't let her hear you
Come on now you gotta be strong

You better believe it
Save yourself for somebody

She don't care the way that you do
Oh do
Let me tell you now heart
You're going crazy
Can't you hear a word that I say
Oh heart
She doesn't want you
There's no use in acting this way

 Sans savoir où aller
Sur terre souvent je m'ennuie

Je me cache au fond de mon lit 
Besoin de m'isoler
Je suis un nuage fait de pluie
 Quand j'ai besoin d'aimer

Je veux tout et tout de suite
Faire ce qui me plaît

Alors je joue sans arbitre et je disparais

Et là

A trop vivre on se replie 
On se fait oublier
Et tous ces livres que je lis 
Juste pour me consoler

Je suis îvre de poésie 
J'essaie de m'envoler 
J'ai tellement peur de l'ennui
De n'plus être épaulée

Comme un remède à tous les maux

Sortie de la ronde

De changer d'atmosphère

Aujourd'hui tes mots n'ont plus de sens
Ne me ne me retiens pas 
C'est fini alors libère-moi 
Oublie-moi

Je pars en cavale
Réfugiée dans mes pensées
Là où rien ne peut me blesser

Je te perce au grand jour L'amour tu n'y connais rien

Sous tes airs de p'tit Prince 
Je n'suis pas un mouton
Tu veux un dessin ?

Est-ce que t'en vaut la peine
 J'en ai fini avec tout ça
Trop de choses qui me gênent
 Je pars me trouver un roi

Ce soir les masques tombent
Le Prince n'est pas celui qu'on croit 
Trop de jeux dans ton monde
Je pars me trouver un roi

Tes conquêtes tu les enchaînes

Comme un enfant
Qui perd encore ses dents 
Mais tu mords là où ça fait mal

Sans foi ni loi
Elles en pincent toutes pour toi
Tu n'préfères pas faire de choix
J'n'ai pas ma place

Le charme est rompu",Mon Roi
Manowar,"He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die

Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
See's his life blood leaving...
Circling lower the vultures fly

These bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign

From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps
while the undead cry
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry

And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring

He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let you not pass abandon return to the world from once you came
And seek payment not only for thy known anguish
But vindicate the souls of the Unavenged""

And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the Unavenged

And to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
They brought forth their Demon horse called Black Death
A grim steed so fiercely might and black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness
Save from his burning eyes of crimson fire

And on that night they rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder

Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives

No one can escape me on Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives

I spare not land or servants my wake is slow dead there
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life but when I'm through they know they must pay",Dark Avenger

I am a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in a middle of the stage
And in a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Man I couldn't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean

Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast

See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.

The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign

Earth be cleansed in a blaze

Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.

He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man

Manowar,"The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade and borrow
But then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers, knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted, as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among them free
Our trail of tears would end, one day at wounded knee

Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me

When we do the ghost dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn
Great spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me

Red cloud, black hawk, sitting bull
Crazy horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave
Warriors to the grave

There has been much killing
There will be much more
The medicine man is dancing
He's calling us to war
Hatchets sing with pride
Let the white men die

Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me

Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky

Yes! Tell Me About When You Were A Boy.
Well, Then, I Shall Have To Take You Back
With Me, A Long Way In Time

It Was My Thirteenth Year On A Cold Winter's
Day, As I Walked Through The Enchanted Forest,
I Heard The Sounds Of Horses And Men At Arms.
I Felt Compelled To Walk On And Find The Place
Of These Sounds. And When The Forest Did Clear
I Was Standing On A Hill. Before Me There Was
A Great Plane, Atoned The Armies Of The World,
Standing, Waiting. I Thought To Myself, For
Whom Or For What Are They Waiting ?
Suddenly A Gust Of Wind Come Up From The North
There Appeared A Lone Rider, Holding A Sword Of
Steel. Then From The South Came Another, Bearing
A Battle Axe. From The East Came A Third,
Holding A Spiked Club, And Finally, From The
West A Rider Who Wielded A Great Hammer Of War.
With Them Came Their Soldiers Of Death, Followed
By An Army Of Immortals. They Were Few In
Number, But The Look In Their Eyes Told All
Who Beheld Them That They Would Leave This
Day Only In Victory Or Death. And There Was
A Great Silence

My Heart Began To Pound, Storm Clouds Filled
The Sky With Darkness. Rain Came And Four
Winds Blew With Such Anger That I Held Fast To
A Tree. I Watched The Four Riders Raise Their
Weapons Into The Air. Without Warning, Screaming
Their War Cry They Led The Attack. Down To The
Battle They Ride. They Met The Armies Of The
World With A Mighty Clash! I Could Feel The
Ground shake, The Earth Drank Much Blood That Day.
Each Of The Four, Was Into Himself A Whirlwind
Of Doom

When The Smoke Did Clear, Many Thousands Were
Dead. There Was Much Blood And Gore. Their
Bodies Lay Broken And Scattered Across The
Battle Field, Like Brown Leaves Blown By The
Wind. And I Saw The For Ride Together To The
Top Of The Hill, While Below Them The Soldiers
Of Death Assembled All Those Who Would Now
Swear Allegiance To Them.

And The Four Spoke The Words Of The
Warriors Prayer.

Gods Of War I Call You, My Sword Is By My Side.
I Seek A Life Of Honor Free From All False Pride.
I Will Crack The Whip With A Bold Mighty Hail.
Cover Me With Death If I Should Ever Fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity - Hail, Hail, Hail

And As I Stood And Looked On, I Heard The Armies
Of The World Hail Them Without End, And Their
Voices Of Victory Carried Long And Fat Throughout
The Land!

Well, That's It. Did You Like The Story?
Yeah, It Was Great!
Oh, Good, I'm Glad. Now Off To Bed With You.

Open wide thy gates embrace me.

Raise high your hands to bid a last
Farewell to the viking land.

I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.

I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.

With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time

The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will are a prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night

I have nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payments can never be late

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Light has no meaning
Awake me I'm dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot strives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution unfailing

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot strives in the Storm

Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you
Wore was mine, I will not rest until
Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say
Goodbye, until we meet in the sky

Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods weigh my
Fate from this day do I abstain, to a memory of
Hate to pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill, no walls can
Contain in the Gods almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The Gods leave no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let my arrows fly
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand it was
Foretold I will die by my hand
Into Hades my soul descends

Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny

My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath I was born to bring, my birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and death
Ties to Earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall the Hades waits
Kill
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
I fall upon your bringing death, the Gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall unto their
Knees Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die die die die 

The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled
In the hear of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
With oxen , sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral Pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
Until your body is burned

Manowar,"Grand father, tell me a story!
All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story
A real story?
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill
Before me there was a great plane
Atoned the armies of the world,standing, waiting
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?

Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club
And finally, from the west a rider
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number

But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger
That I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack

Down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field
Like brown leaves blown by the wind

And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land

Well, That's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they? They were the Metal Kings

Måns Zelmerlöw,"Another morning late in bed
Staring at the ceiling
Thinking of you

Another song went in my head
Where did I go wrong?
Thinking of you

I will try to carry on
I'll sing another love song

I'm no superhero
I'm no Mister Bond
I'm your Agent Zero
I'm just myself
My love is blind
I'll wait until the end of time

Walking tall or standing still
Doesn't really matter, 
When you're not here

Supposed to write the word fulfill
But hard to imagine
When you're not here

I will try another song
Not more than three minutes long

And I said
I'm no superhero
No, I'm no Mister Bond
I'm your Agent Zero
I'm just myself
My love is blind
I'll wait until the end of time

I'd break the barriers just to see
How our love would set us free
Imagine how life could be
I'll write a bridge with chords so strong
Take us where we both belong

I'm no Mister Bond

I didn't, I know that I didn't, no

I'm thinking about God
Is it a he or a she or a feeling or love?
Does she personally ordain every occurrence and every moment
Or did she set the universe in motion and then move on?
To try to top her achievement?
Maybe this universe wasn't an achievement at all
Maybe our lives, our wars, our fuckups, our diseases
Our love, our humanity, our passion, our pennies, our Holocaust
Are all just a rehearsal before the show
A sketch before the mural, a stretch before the jump
Does she love me? Does God know I'm here?
I'm thinking about God, I'm thinking about sex

""Honorable,"" ""good,"" and ""straight""

I watched a movie on the internet alone and now it's over
I pick up my phone and text every female I know within a fifteen-mile radius

They want a ear in the fucking mail

I'm writin' at my hotel desk, I'm thinkin' very slow
There's a female in my bed that I barely know
I just put her in my verse, that shit is very dope
I call you on the phone and proceed to say somethin' dumb
To see if I can feel somethin' other than fuckin' numb
You say you've realize I'm the thing that you've been runnin' from
I tell you, ""Baby, join the club, that's all I've ever done""
Red wine, red roses, breakup, stripper pushin' molly pills
I asked you not to call me, we both know you prolly will
You cut me places no one sees, I know your style of play
Fuck this city, I'm gon' move a million miles away

I mean at first, you're gonna pretend to forget about her
You might call her, I don't know, whatever
But then, eventually, you really will forget about her
But what if she comes back first?
Hmm, see, that's the thing is somehow they know not to come back until you really forget",A Million Miles

And my breasts, and my beloved

Yeah, I'm drowning in my own genius, that's what I'd like to think
That's the attitude I've taken on these type of things
A man can never own a woman, he just thinks he does
Add it to the list of the dirty shit I'm thinking up
Just tryna lighten up your mood, but you prefer it dark
Soften all of the places up that were hard
Put a couple of my kisses on your birthmarks
I think you're hiding who you are and that's the worst part
I never wanted to own you, just your neck
Just your good needs, just your two breasts

But I can see right through you like vodka, sneaking subtle
We spent some weeks apart, I couldn't wait to see you
But I got home and it was different, I don't believe you
You was out fucking him, you know that's just the truth
Wanted to fuck with you, did not know you could be so rude
But looks could be deceiving, maybe you never see me
Maybe this all just is a movie and it's just a screening
Maybe you wanted me and I don't want you anymore
Maybe I fall in love with everything I should ignore

Just your neck, just my couch
Just your perfume, and my beloved

Yeah, maybe it's today, maybe it's tomorrow
I'm really tryna change, I'm just feeling hollow
Some were made to lead, some were made to follow
I'm all up on Raya, tryna fuck a model
Because thinking 'bout you with him made me sick
I should really beat his ass, but instead, I took your shit
You always coming at me with some kind of weakness
I don't need your secrets, I don't need your deep shit

Don't call me my government name, girl

You're already fading away in my mind
Your mouth is not moving, it's saying it's fine

For all the hurt that your daddy put on you
I'd rather take a Caddy to Atlanta inside you 
To Little Ronny's house, I'd pretend I'm Bill Bellamy

I wanna believe in what I hear and what I read

I wanna believe that when I fuck it's romantic
But no lovers remind me of love
And I need to believe in moderation
'Cause believers believe in too much
I learned to lie
I learned to lie when I was younger

This whole fuckin' thing is a front

I've kept it all up for years
Now I don't have too much more stamina

Silently screamin' out
""Why the fuck I gotta ride this bench, coach?""

My smile is my makeup, my necklace is my noose
And I know all the words that you're tryin' to hear
The same three ones that got me hidin' in fear
Are they I love you? There, is that enough?

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.","I Wish You Love, for orchestra"
Mantovani,"And I wake up in the mornin' 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little green apples
Mantovani,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love","Misty, song"
Mantovani,"Whenever we kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips may be near
But where is your heart

It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
But where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
That you've a heart that never melts
When we kiss, do you close your eyes
Pretending that I'm someone else

You must break the spell
This cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
Darling, where is your heart",Moulin Rouge Theme

Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold

Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And luscious lips, as red as wine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart",It Happned in Monterey

The laugh that floats on a summer night

Ni siquiera a visitarme;
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción;
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho;
Dec? percanta, qu? has hecho
De mi pobre corazón!

Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida

Asoma por la ventana,

Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Eu já sabia que isso ia acontecer
O tempo passa, eu fico mal
É ilusão achar que tudo está igual
Você apareceu pra mim
Não posso evitar, me sentir assim
O que eu faço pra escapar
Dessa vontade que eu tenho de falar
Toda hora com você
Faço planos impossíveis pra te ver
Mas pra mim são tão reais
O que aconteceu eu não me lembro mais

Eu poderia escrever mil canções só pra você
Poderia te falar meus motivos pra gostar tanto de você
Me diz quando a gente vai se ver
Pra eu poder te abraçar
E tentar te explicar
A falta que você me faz
Eu não aguento mais
Ficar tão longe de você

Você me diz que não tá bem
Que não para de pensar em mim também
Agora, antes de dormir
Por dois segundos, eu consigo até sorrir
Porque essa complicação
Distância é o fim pra quem tem coração
Será que eu devo te dizer
Que eu quase choro, quando falam de você
Mais eu consigo segurar
Pra ter certeza, que ninguém vai reparar
Que eu to cada vez pior
E a saudade em mim é cada vez maior

Eu poderia escrever mil canções só pra você
Poderia te falar meus motivos pra gostar tanto de você
Me diz quando a gente vai se ver
Pra eu poder te abraçar
E tentar te explicar
A falta que você me faz
Eu não aguento mais
Ficar tão longe de você
E eu nem sei se algum dia eu já me senti assim
Eu nem me lembro de querer alguém como eu quero você pra mim
E é por isso que eu vou te dizer

Eu poderia escrever mil canções só pra você
Poderia te falar meus motivos pra gostar tanto de você
Me diz quando a gente vai se ver
Pra eu poder te abraçar
E tentar te explicar
A falta que você me faz
E eu não aguento mais

Entre deux tours, j’ai toujours la tête qui penche,

Je suis tellement attaché à ce lien symbolique,
Que parole contre parole, je t’explique,

Ici, fait pas chaud,

Parce qu’il fait froid dans ce ghetto

A la fois précis comme un bisou dans un bordel
Et tellement indécis sur elle ou bien sur elle
Sorry, je reste planté à regarder les gens,
A pas savoir comment ils savent tout
Tout le temps, tout,
Et comme je suis né des deux côtés de la balance,
Que pour moi c’est précieux comme une chance
Et comme je refuse absolument de m’engluer les deux ailes,
Avec ce doux nectar que l’on appelle consensuel

J’exige le dernier mot,
Ma place dans le bateau,
Ici, fait pas chaud,
Ma part du gâteau,
Parce qu’il fait froid dans ce ghetto,

Pour le rocker, moi j’suis trop chanson
Pour les chanteurs, moi bah, j’suis trop boxon
Alors je fais ma sauce, comme je l’entends
A la fois douce et relevée, comme un printemps
Comme la vie, elle est parsemée d’embûches
Qu’il y a ces abeilles, ces reines qui dominent la ruche

Manuel,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Has left a pool of tears

Manuel Barrueco,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Of a sermon that no one will hear

Manuel Barrueco,"Destination outward bound
I turn to see the northern lights behind the wing
Horizons seem to beckon me
Learned how to cry too young, so now I live to sing

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you

Horizons seem to beckon me
Learned how to cry too young, so now I live to sing

You know it's hard away from you
Traveling roads and passing through
It's not for money and it's not for fame
I just can't explain, sometimes it's lonely

Marking the space between the days
Early hours pass away
I sing to you of northern lights
I sing for you of northern nights

Past or future, here or there
Shelter comes in words from you, so talk to me
I hear your voice, it comforts me
In morning dreams I take your hand, you walk with me

[Chorus]

Peace enfolds the still night air
Home again I look for you and find you there

Destination homeward now
Take the easy way, bring me down
Making the hard way now I see
Hard to be really free, I'm missing you near me

Marking the space between the days
Early hours pass away
I sing to you of northern lights
I sing for you of northern nights

The northern nights are in my eyes
They guide me back to you

Manuel Carrasco,"Ya no es lo mismo 
No quedan ganas 
Pero luego de los suspiros 
Oscuro y nada 
Ya no hay canciones de madrugadas 
Ni tan siquiera un comentario ni una mirada 
Es que yo puedo amarte si tu me amas 
Ya me han dolido tanto el alma 
Es amanecer contigo cada mañana 

Muriéndonos de risa en la ventana
En la ventana 
Es que yo puedo amarte si tu me amas 
Ya me han dolido tanto el alma 
Es amanecer contigo cada mañana 
Muriéndonos de risa en la ventana

Que esta canción nace de ti por ser la dueña
La dueña de mi inspiración
La que despierta en mi la voz
Dando sentido a todo lo que no lo tiene
Me paro en este renglón para decirte que te quiero

Escúchame, si estás ahí, quiero que sepas
Que sigo aqui sintiéndote con este miedo
Por que no aguantes
Y el corazón se te distraiga por momentos
Y te olvides de mi
Que envidiosa la distancia
También quiso formar parte de lo nuestro

Y ahora que mi canción te toca
Que tiembla de emoción
Que sus palabras juegan como locas a extrañarte
Y ahora, si ves como te lloran
Acuerdate de mi, necesito tanto verte

Escúchame, si estas ahi, quiero que sepas
Que no te olvido
Que no hay distancia que nos detengan
Que a veces caigo en el recuerdo
De tus manos con mis manos
Y me hacen sonreir
Asi me siento feliz dentro de esta tristeza

Y ahora que mi canción te toca
Que tiembla de emoción
Que sus palabras juegan como locas a extrañarte
Y ahora, si ves como te lloran
Acuérdate de mi, necesito tanto verte

Manuel Carrasco,"Cómo te cuento el silencio 
Que me atrapa cuando hablas 
Silencio que me asesina 
Dejándome sin palabras 
Como te digo que pienso 
Si no adelantamos nada 
Tú no escuchas lo que siento 
Y yo tiro la toalla 

Cuando ya bajo los brazos 
Porque no arreglamos nada 
Tú sigues en el combate 
Mientras suena la campana 
Saco mi bandera blanca tan gastada de derrota 
Rendirme no es que yo quiera 
Pero a veces se me antoja 

Ay amor que nos está pasando 
Que sin vivir 
Antes todo era blanco 
Y ahora gris 
Se encienden las alarmas y el temor 
Que pena amor caemos en la trampa otra vez 
Porque no lo arreglamos de una vez 
Si no le hacemos daño al corazón 
Si no podemos vivir el uno sin el otro 

De pronto dices que quieres 
que te deje y no me hablas 
Más miedo me da el silencio 
Si me grita tu mirada 
Y tantas vueltas que doy 
Para resolver la historia 
Intentando convencerte 
Y me falla la memoria 

Y que bonito que en sueños 
A veces nos reconciliamos 
Luego siempre me despierto 
Y no recoges mi abrazo 
Y te espero en mi guarida 
Mientras suena un triste tango 
Con sabor a despedida 
Y cansado de fracaso 

Ay amor que nos está pasando 
Que sin vivir 
Antes todo era blanco 
Y ahora gris 
Se encienden las alarmas y el temor 
Que pena amor caemos en la trampa otra vez 
Porque no lo arreglamos de una vez 
Si no le hacemos daño al corazón 
Si no podemos vivir el uno sin el otro

Manuel Carrasco,"Porque eres la calle por la que me gusta pasear tranquilo 
porque me gusta perderme en el laberinto de emociones 
que me ofrece tu cuerpo mio 
porque los motivos que encuentro son los del amor 
ese que te robo el nombre 

Porque mi cama se pone triste si no estas con nosotros 
porque tu eres tu y yo soy yo 
y eso es maravilloso 
porque me llenas la vida de vida 
por rescatarme del peligro 
peligroso de la nada 

Porque desde que te vi 
no he parado de soñar contigo 
en tus ojos libres me perdí 
y perdido en ti todavía sigo 
porque prefiero vivir a tu lado 
siempre a la deriva 
porque me gusta sentir como mi pecho te grita 

Na na na na na na na oh! 
Na na na na na na na

Porque eres el viento que a mis sentimientos 
las ventanas abres 
porque si descubres mi defectos 
solo importa lo importante 
porque necesito cuidarte y darte mi verdad 
mi verdad que no se esconde 

Porque se abren de par en par las puertas del paraíso 
cuando me dices te quiero suspirandome al odio 
porque la guerra que libraba dentro 
la ganaste con un beso 
devolviendome a la vida 


Porque desde que te vi 
no he parado de soñar contigo 
en tus ojos libres me perdí 
y perdido en ti todavía sigo

Yo soy su manicomio 
Si la beso en la boca
También me vuelvo loco

Sabe que me desarma 
Cuando viene de frente
Y juega con ventaja
Delante de la gente

Como un chicle en su boca
Mueve mis sentimientos
Si voy a paso rápido
Cambio a pasito lento

Y resucito con ella

Es el aire que aviva 
La vela que se apaga
Y es tan libre del viento 
Que es con quien más escapa

Si se pinta los labios
Pone mi boca roja
Y yo le pinto los ojos 
Del color de las olas

Manuel Carrasco,"No soy ejemplo para nada ni para nadie
Tengo miserias como cualquiera de ustedes
14 marcas que me duelen en el alma 
Y 100 defectos que me siguen y no aprenden

Las dudas se divierten, no descansan nunca
Como los miedos que siempre estarán presente
A veces sonrío sin ganas y al revés
A nadie importa, nadie tiene que saber

Y aunque las cosas con el tiempo no se olvidan
Voy a estar más alerta, más tiempo conmigo
Que cada vez soy más consciente que la vida
Sin darnos cuenta se consume en un suspiro

Voy a quererme para quererte mucho más
Voy a tratar de ser mejor y más valiente
Es el momento de enfrentarse a la verdad
Que ya está bien de procurar y perder siempre

Recuerdo que un día fui fuerte
Recuerdo que no juzgué a nadie
Porque cuando me siento débil
Aún sigo queriendo, queriendo matarme

Qué duro es a veces vivir
Pero es preferible sentir
Aunque nos duela la verdad
Siendo uno mismo en cualquier parte

Y ahora que entiendo lo que mis padres de niño
Siempre decían con el corazón temblando
“Nunca te fíes del que quiera ser tu amigo
Que con un caramelo, te mete en el saco”

Y piensa si eres uno más de los que estrellan
Su tiempo en un televisor de color rosa
Y si es verdad, yo fui de OT ¿qué, te molesta?
Si no te gusta, a otra cosa mariposa

Y si a un amigo que no tenemos remedio
Abrir el corazón siempre nos sale siempre caro
Que no me importa lo perdido si es sincero
A mí me importa todo el vino derramado

Yo que forjé mi historia con los buscavidas
Pierden el tiempo los que intentan que me frene
Por eso ahora si me escuchas, no te rindas
Siéntete libre y orgulloso de quien eres

Recuerdo que un día fui fuerte
Recuerdo que no juzgue a nadie
Porque cuando me siento débil
Aún sigo queriendo, queriendo matarme

Qué duro es a veces vivir
Pero es preferible sentir
Aunque nos duela la verdad, aunque nos duela
Siendo uno mismo en cualquier parte

Siendo uno mismo en cualquier parte

En el espejo, las ojeras me contaron
Aquellas noches de cuánto la eché de menos
En la locura, asesinando las llamadas
Y en cada muerte despertaba un nuevo intento

No quiso verme, y ahora es quien me anda buscando
No es que no quiera que me encuentre, es que mi sueño
Lo estoy viviendo con una mujer sincera
Ella es la reina y tú una princesa del cuento

Que no se trata de quererse más que nadie
¿Y por qué piensas que me lo monto de artista?
Más bien me pasa lo contrario muchas veces
También me siento pequeñito en esta vida

Vale la pena pelear por nuestros sueños
Vale la pena equivocarse y levantarse
Vale la pena liberarse y ser el dueño
De la verdad siendo uno mismo en cualquier parte

Recuerdo que un día fui fuerte
Recuerdo que no juzgue a nadie
Porque cuando me siento débil
Aún sigo queriendo, queriendo matarme

Qué duro es a veces vivir

Denke an Geschichten des Lebens,
Blick nach Links, Sie ist nicht mehr da!
Die Augen schwer, Ich habe schlaflose Nächte,
Krise bleibt die Selbe, nur der Wagen hat gewechselt!
Sodbrennen, schritt ins Bad, Wasser in's Gesicht,
Ein Blick in den Spiegel sagt, dass hier bin nicht Ich!
Entrüstet in das White-T, Jogginghose drunter,
Ich brauch Frischluft, Schlüssel zum R5,
Check ob ich die wichtigsten Lieder habe,
Stell den I-Pod auf gemischte Wiedergabe.
Chinchkabel und meine Browning nehm ich mit,
Mein Pott, mein Block, doch Vertrauen ist ne Bitch!
Durch's Treppenhaus, ohne Fragen, ohne Plan,
Und die Außenbeleuchtung vom Wagen erhellt die Straße.
Schließe die Türe, lass mich fallen in mein Reich,
Und die Zündung sagt dein Leid ist bald vorbei!

Denn ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Fahre bis um 4, Mois diese Straßen inspirieren!
Ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Regen auf der Frontscheibe ist der Takt 
zu dem ich meine Songs schreibe!

Die Nacht so schön, dass ich cruisen muss,
Kopf aus dem Fenster, blick Richtung Sterne,
Und der Wind gibt mir einen Bruderkuss.
Suche Trost auf dem Asphalt, Im Schoß dieser Wege,
Denn nur hier hab ich ein so schönes Leben!
Azad du fehlst mir aus den Boxen, Tränen!
Ich Rap mit und sag Bruder du sprichst mir aus der Seele!
Grüne Welle auf den Straßen, Rote Ampeln in meinem Kopf!
Mein Leben entgleist hier, dass ist Pott!
Denk an Imani und an Vale und wie schwer es ist,
Doch so bekannt, die schlimmste Reise ist der erste Schritt!
Greif zum Iphone und scroll durch die Kontakte,
Tipp auf ihre Nummer und verdräng in mir was Hass ist!
Handy aus, Red mir selber ein, dass ich nicht mehr kämpfen brauch!
Ende aus, dann kommt alles hoch, Ich bekomme ne Idee,
Greif zur Browning, such nen Parkplatz und bleib stehen!

Denn ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Fahre bis um 4, Mois diese Straßen inspirieren!
Ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Regen auf der Frontscheibe ist der Takt zu dem ich meine Songs schreibe!

Das Chrom auf meiner Handfläche,
Der Blick ins Schwarze, ist nichts was mich anlächelt!
Ich atme durch, der Film geht Los und ich spür es in der Pumpe,
Von der Wiege bis zum Grab, im Bruchteil ner Sekunde!
Mut auf Maximum, Mam und Pap ich Lieb euch,
Vale vergib mir, Er stirbt hier,
Imani vergib mir, Papa ist zerbrechlich und schwach,
Und hat für den Rest keine Kraft.
Den nur ein Gott außer Gott,
Mündung an die Schläfe, Ich mach es!
Stopp! Vibration in meiner Tasche.
Jetzt trau ich mich es nicht mehr,
Denn es erscheint ein V auf meinem Display!
Tränen auf dem Weg, doch ich wisch sie von der Backe,
Tipp auf annehmen und sichere die Waffe!
In mir alles Leer, das alles macht keinen Sinn,
Doch trotzdem irgendwie froh warte ich auf ihre Stimme:
Hallo Schatz!
Hallo Schatz, du brauchst dich nicht freuen,
Ich ruf nur an um dir zu sagen Ich hab nen neuen Freund!
Egal was du sagst und machst.

Ich war auf Nachtschicht,

Denn ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Fahre bis um 4, Mois diese Straßen inspirieren!
Ich bin wieder mal auf Nachtschicht,
Regen auf der Frontscheibe ist der Takt zu dem ich meine Songs schreibe!

But I was equally sorry

He hands me another ?hot of vodka

Fatti grande dolce luna e riempi il cielo intero
E perché quel suo sorriso possa ritornare ancora
Splendi sole domattina come non hai fatto ancora

E per poi farle cantare, le canzoni che ha imparato
Io le costruirò un silenzio che nessuno ha mai sentito
Sveglierò tutti gli amanti, parlerò per ore ed ore
Abbracciamoci più forte, perché lei vuole l'amore

Poi corriamo per le strade e mettiamoci a ballare
Perché lei vuole la gioia, perché lei odia il rancore
E poi coi secchi di vernice coloriamo tutti i muri
Case, vicoli e palazzi, perché lei ama i colori
Raccogliamo tutti i fiori, che può darci primavera
Costruiamole una culla, per amarci quando è sera
Poi saliamo su nel cielo, e prendiamole una stella

Follow them like everyone else
