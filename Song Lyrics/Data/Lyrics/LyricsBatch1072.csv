Oscar Peterson,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too
",Emily
Oscar Peterson,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much in such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me",Falling in Love With Love
Oscar Peterson,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love
Oscar Peterson,"How glad the many millions
Of Annabelle's and Lilian's
Would be, to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, there you go again, could you care, now wait a minute
For a lovely cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush
But I have got a crush, my baby, on you, oh yeah",I've Got a Crush on You
Oscar Peterson,"Things have come to a pretty pass, 
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that.
Goodness knows what the end will be,
Oh, I don't know where I'm at...
It looks as if we two will never be one,
Something must be done.

You say eether and I say eyether,
You say neether and I say nyther,
Eether, eyether, neether, nyther,
Let's call the whole thing off!
You like potato and I like potahto,
You like tomato and I like tomahto,
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto!
Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh!  If we ever part,
Then that might break my heart!
So, if you like pajamas and I like pajahmas,
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajahmas.
For we know we need each other, 
So we better call the calling off off.
Let's call the whole thing off!

You say laughter and I say lawfter,
You say after and I say awfter,
Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter,
Let's call the whole thing off!
You like vanilla and I like vanella,
You, sa's'parilla and I sa's'parella,
Vanilla, vanella, Choc'late, strawb'ry!
Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part, 
Then that might break my heart!
So, if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters.
For we know we need each other,
So we better call the calling off off!
Let's call the whole thing off!",Let's Call the Whole Thing Off
Oscar Peterson,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Oscar Peterson,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In
Oscar Peterson,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love
Oscar Peterson,"Holdin' hands at midnight
Beneath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

Holdin' hands at midnight
Beneath a starry sky

And strollin' with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door

And if you get it, won't you tell me how?",Nice Work If You Can Get It
Oscar Peterson,"Drop that long face
Come on, have your fling
Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this old world on a string
Put on your dancing shoes
Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb

Shall we dance, or keep on moping?
Shall we dance and walk on air?
Shall we give in to despair?
Or shall we dance with never a care?
Life is short, we're growing older
Don't you be an also-ran
You'd better dance, little lady
Dance, little man
Dance whenever you can",Shall We Dance?
Oscar Peterson,"Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, ""strike up the band""

Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To the martial swing, strike up the band

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
You son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike up the band!

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun

Oscar Peterson,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?""",They All Laughed
Oscar Peterson,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day [Version]
Oscar Peterson,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy
Oscar Peterson,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew

That all I longed for long ago

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away)
Oscar Peterson,"You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh! You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now 

Does your dad appreciate 
That you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
You're such a treat for the eyes? 

You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child

Oscar Peterson,"We're sitting out here on the runway
Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight",Flying Home
Oscar Peterson,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""

Many moons had passed away

Oscar Peterson,"My gal and I, we had a fight 
And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too

Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean

She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm

No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be

But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

Oscar Peterson,"Well I'm known near and far
As the cousin to the czar
I'm the Duke, Duke of Dubuque
It's well understood 
That my credit is no good (no good, no good)
I'm the Duke of Dubuque
And if you don't believe me and tell me it ain't true

In the books my father was the czar of Prussia
But he sailed away one day
To the state of Iowa

Yeah call them Oak hounds, if you please

Oscar Peterson,"Times have changed
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

Just think of those shocks you've got

And those blues you've got
From those news you've got

Oscar Peterson,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold

Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So, tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

Is my idea of nothing to do

That's the beginning
Just one of the clues

In learnin' the Blues

The cigarettes you light
One after another
Won't help you forget him
And the way that you loved him

You're only burning
A torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track
For learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd

The nights when you don't sleep
The whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget him
Soon you even stop tryin'

And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;

Love, look away from me.
Fly, when you pass my door,
Fly and get lost at sea.

Call it a day.

No good are you for me,
No good am I for you.

Wanting you so, 
I try too much.
After you go,
I cry too much.

Leave me and set me free,

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Marianne is faithful to the sky
And a brand new beat
Floating from a room across the street
It wasn't only Armstrong up there on the moon

Why bother going outside?
Interaction is my first mistake.

But how can I help
If you keep trying to tell me to get away?
Psychology reason
Your abusive mannerisms?
I don't have the time
To pay sympathy to your tragedy.
High maintenance, problematic,
If I'm the asshole,
Why do you still call me?

Serves only to consume energy.

Osker,"Save your pride.
If you could separate your fears from your beliefs,
Then I think you'd see how you are no more alone than a million others could be.
If we stay alive just by changing, then from what are you made?
Of all the things I didn't tell you, I never lied.
What's you connection?
Omission or failure to confide.
The plan's to hit me with all the force of energy I've saved.
If she only knew my wrongs, things would be going right.
Speak so slowly.
How can this be happening?
Sharing air with the enemy.
I read a fucking joke on a storage room wall that robbed more girls than it was ever meant to.
More than one's too much.

And she explained how we fit perfectly.

I feel torn into insufficient amounts of two.
Is this a sign of what I'm made of,
Or how I allow myself to be treated?
Grab the wrists, pull away.

I can't believe this is me,
Well you're drowning me with my own hate, so I
Do you feel they're laughing at you through the TV? I know I do.
Do you wonder how they get away with that shit they say?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Oswaldo Montenegro,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Lua E Flor/Agonia

não me impeça de ver o que anseio
que a morte de tudo em que acredito
não me tape os ouvidos e a boca

a outra metade é silêncio

Que a música que ouço ao longe
seja linda ainda que tristeza
que a mulher que amo seja pra sempre amada
mesmo que distante
pois metade de mim é partida
a outra metade é saudade.
Quer as palavras que falo
não sejam ouvidas como prece nem repetidas com fervor
apenas respeitadas como a única coisa
que resta a um homem inundado de sentimentos

se transforme na calma e paz que mereço
que a tensão que me corrói por dentro

Que o medo da solidão se afaste
e o convívio comigo mesmo se torne ao menos suportável
que o espelho reflita meu rosto num doce sorriso
que me lembro ter dado na infância
pois metade de mim é a lembrança do que fui
a outra metade não sei

Que não seja preciso mais do que uma simples alegria
pra me fazer aquietar o espírito
e que o seu silêncio me fale cada vez mais
pois metade de mim é abrigo
a outra metade é cansaço

Que a arte me aponte uma resposta
mesmo que ela mesma não saiba
e que ninguém a tente complicar

Otep,"I had this dream...
Where I woke up
To a grand commotion
And um... I just jumped from the blankets
And whipped the door from its lock,
And rush blindly into the blackness of the hallway
But there, on all sides
Lying next to each other
Were rows and rows of executioners...

Some were shirtless
And throbbing with anticipation.
Sweat delicately sneaking through their body hair
All were hooded
Some like seventeenth century guillotine henchmen
Others had crudely made hoods
Like scarecrows or ripped ski masks
With slobber from their clenching jaws
And some had burlap masks that looked like they were made of human skin.

Each one held a weapon.
Large mallets
Crudely fashioned axes
And large clubs
Pipes

But I wasn't compelled to retreat.

No

I was forced to move between them.
Past their swinging weapons
The clubs
The bats
The slicing tools
The shovels
The large and small axes
Boards with nails, staples and razorblades embedded in them
Taking the beating,
Falling down,
Getting up,
Again and again and again and again
Driven to make it out...

At any cost

And next,
I stumbled into a... this strange marshy world
Where I was oddly drowning in squirrels and other large, starving rodents.
From above, out on the treetops,
Several dolls fell from the branches
And they were hanging
With nooses made of human hair
They started biting and sucking and trying to feed from me...
Trying to enter my belly and some pushed large needles into my veins and...
And as I looked back, some had nails through their hands, torsos and throats.

I was froze
Dead eyes...
Carbonized...
As I kicked them away
I could see all around me...
Of piles and piles of dead sea life
Large fish, smelly crustaceans

And their soulless empty bodies whispered
A secret language I couldn't decipher but somehow understood.

And their cries were
""Feed me... Feed me...""

They wanted me to devour those around them
Chew them up into pieces
And smear them inside their mouths
And as I turned around
I could see the shape of a woman
Perfect...
Perfectly erotic
Squatting over a pile of these dead things...
And as I ran to her and said ""what the fuck are you doing?!""

And she had no face
And she turned to glass
And suddenly cracked
And then exploded into 1000 pieces at my feet

And just as I took a quick breath,
This world was shoved and decimated
But an intruding tidal wave
Of microorganisms, exploding atoms...

And suddenly moon rose...
Frightened, aching, and alone...
And that's what I remember most...

...The ache

I can't escape
The ache.......",[Untitled Hidden Track]

To smell your fear
To cover your body
With kisses and kerosene
To watch you burn

To hear you scream in agony

Cracking as it cooks

And the perfect wife
And the perfect kids

I will finally be somebody...)

(Let's play born-again American, resistance is the game!)

Two pigs wearing suits
Brought the news
That I'm wanted by the bank

They say the rent is due
Caesar's onto you
So you better remember your place

Then they outsourced my job
And gave a raise to my boss

Bailed out the banks
But billed me for the loss

They say we must submit
And be one with the Machine

Because the Kingdom of Fear
Needs compliance to succeed

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

(The revolution will be monetized
And streamed live via renegade WiFi)

The clinic said I'm sick
Toxic..... and impure

But there isn't any cure
For the poor or uninsured

So we live our digital lives
On multiple screens

And we forget that
The blood of the workers
Grease the machines

In the Psalm of the Fiends
Love ...... discriminates

While the fat cats feed the rats
Their daily dose of cake

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Haters, betrayers, liars, and thieves

(America)

She sold her soul
For designer clothes

For the perfect lips
And the perfect nose

The winner in the end
Always owns the most

Reality tv told her so!

(Mammonites)

Money changer!
Greedy bankers!

This is the Peoples House!

My minister has a sinister plan
To save my soul with a credit card scam

Exploitation is contagious
For the selfish & self-inflated

Start a war, use the poor,
Watch our profits soar & soar

We've become a nation of wolves
Ruled by sheep

Owned by swine
Overfed & put to sleep

And while the media's elite
Decrees what to think

I am wide awake
On the edge
And on the brink

So when Atlas shrugs
And The Fountainhead bleeds
And when Walstreet Apostles
Preach a gospel of greed

I'll renounce the fame of this gluttonous age
And be a Born-again American
Resistance is to blame!

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Haters, betrayers, liars, and thieves

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
A nation of wolves - ruled by sheep!

Otep,"The soft sound of snow crunching
Underfoot gives me comfort.
Her building is at the end of the block. 
She lives on the north side.
Bottom floor. Middle apartment.
I see her, one, two, three, four, five steps.
Wrong key. Lock clicks. She drops her
Coat and scarf in the entry and
Kicks off those, vexing shoes.
She shuffles to the kitchen and pours
A glass of scotch. (I am inside)
She lights a cigarette and blows
The smoke over the match. (She doesn't notice)

The gray smog rises from her
Lips like a cremation furnace.
The simple elegance of this quiet
Moment is almost irresistible.
(But, I wait)

She slugs back the scotch,
Finishes her smoke and ashes it
In the sink. She unties her hair
And enters the hallway, past the
Childless bedroom with the empty
Crib, past the altar coated in wax
Like a wedding cake, and the tiny
Packages of meat, dead flowers,
And baby's breath.

She enters the bathroom, where 
She undresses. She sits on the 
Edge of the bath. Her naked body 
Folded in half, heavy tits hanging
Like mushy stalactites over her
Lap. (Oh, precious) She closes her 
Eyes and holds her head as if it
Might float away.

For a moment, my thoughts drift
Again, this time to the hammer 
I am holding. The handle is
Smooth as bone, the forged steel
Head is heavy, and I feel powerful. 
She reaches for the faucet
And I snap back to the moment.
Bubbles brim the edge of the 
Tub. Her fingers check the water
Temperature and I am ready.

I move behind her. She doesn't
Hear. I swing the hammer. She
Doesn't see. I crack her skull.
She's in the tub. Face down. I am 
Drowning her, mashing her head
To the bottom, knifing the claw of
The hammer into her spine and
Ribs over and over and over and
Over and over and over and over
And over and,

Her body stops pretending to
Care and surrenders as it is supposed
To. just to be sure, I press
Hard, keeping her head beneath
The bloody water a few moments
More. Her neck snaps, her nose
Breaks, and her face collapses
Against the bottom of the tub. I 
See my reflection in the mirror
And soapy foam has formed a half
Smile over the black nylon mask 
I am wearing

I lean to her. The water glistens
Like glass. I hover over the 
Surface, soft breath causing tiny 
Quakes, and whisper, ""I have done
To you what nature has done to me.""

She doesn't reply.

I stand and turn off the light.
The room is dark and empty.
Just like I am now.",Baby's Breath
Otep,"There are nights, so vacant and hushed, 
I can feel the texture of my tattered soul moving within me.
Black tar, dripping, sticky and thick.
A soft, slow secretion of indifference
Slopping through the hollow suit I use as a body.

They say these are the words of a damaged mind.
But not I
To me, this is insurgency.

I used to dream of being inside the womb.
Fetal universe, black holes and emptiness.
Orbiting the màssive planet of my mother's booming heart.
Tiny yolk body, tethered like an astronaut, 
Adrift in the tranquil spume of desolate bliss.
Tiny fingers inching from chubby stems,
Reaching for that great thumping whoosh of blood and power
That wobbled like a snarling god above me.
My fibrous head translucent as a bell jar,
Would search with great staring eyes deep into the godless dark for a light,
For a sign, for anything other than indifference.
But the universe would never oblige.

Look upon me, a daughter of a child and a monster.
Frozen without cold feeling nothing unsure, 
Uninspired, veins full of air, soul fading into the umbra

Who are they to say what is moral when they are broken?
Who are they to say anything about us?

All this, all this,
And I want to sledgehammer
And leave nothing but dust

To dust
To dust
To dust

He began to scream with the stitches held tight
He rattled the cage and pulled at the lock
With all his might 

So I electrocuted the bars and
He fell asleep from the charge and
I prepared to make him
A star 

He has a webcam
So I helped him understand 

When he woke
I asked him to sing me a song
He obliged but was often off key
So I removed his lower jaw 

Now his tongue juts out like a slimy slug
But he' so eager to please
Tapping the melody on the bars of this large cage
With un-clipped nails he plays 

And once I've had my fun
Bringing dark justice to this
Pathetic goblin
I will
Burn 
Probe 
Break 
And Drain 

And he will be scorched in a bath of pain 

I will drop him into the misty bayou
Where he will be a feast for
Serpents &
Insects &
Beasts &
All the putrid life of the murky bog 

And as he sinks, and as he screams
Into the lens of his webcam
I will play a farewell
An ode to the demons
Waiting for him
In Hell 

He has a webcam

Toiling through the storm and rain,
Watching and patiently waiting,
Until the Savior comes again.

I am coming, Lord, trusting in thy word,
Keep me from the paths of sin, hide me in thy love,
Hide me in thy love, write my name above,
When the gates swing open, let me in.

Keep me fit for service,
Keep me up on every hand,
I've stood many a trial,
Some day I will understand.

Teach me how to love my neighbor,
Teach me how to treat my friend,
Fill me with the Holy Spirit,
Keep me humble to the end.

Tired of this world of sin,
Angels in Heaven beckon,
My weary soul to come in.

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world",Rainy Night in Georgia

Looking back and knowing now
This was meant for me

Though I never journeyed far
Now I see from where You are
You were moving me

Angels singing
Angels singing

It was worth it all
Hearing angels calling out my name
When You reached down for me

Every day gone by
And each moment life was handed me
It's easy now to see

That I could smile
So you'd be seen through me

For the ones that wait behind
Give them just a bit more time
They can smile for me
They can smile for me

It was worth it all
Hearing angels calling out my name
When You reached down for me

And every day gone by
And each moment life was handed me

Sing for me, sing for me

Sing for me, sing for me

Sing for me, sing for me
Sing for me

Sing for me, sing for me

Am I the reason this is over now?
And we'll never be the same again

If you just move on
How can I tell you you're the only one?
And you'll never be the same
We'll never be the same again

And I remember when you said
We would make it last until the end
I could never win those games that you were playing

I hope you find what you're looking for
Instead of always wanting more
And learn that hearts were never meant for breaking

We ignore because

You have to train hard
You have to devote yourself one hundred percent

You can't be a success if you don't have any part of it
Like if you don't have discipline. You need discipline
You need discipline to do things
And the discipline is you do it without things, you know?

No matter if we say we believe this, we believe that
You know there's certain things we believe
But just how strongly we believe is a matter, you know
It's what we want to believe
A force much stronger than us, a power
A power much more powerful, you know? But we still don't know
No matter how much we think we believe
We still tremor at the thought of dying
We shiver almost died, you know?
There's something out there
But just to me it's like the great unknown. You know? I don't know.

Knowing only one way to reach the future

Out of Eden,"Chorus:
I am giving my all to you;
trying to do the best I can
to make sure that I do your plan.
I'm giving my life to you;
gave me life and set me free,
you put your light inside of me.

Everyday I face my fears,
will I make it through the years
of all the pressures;
all the bad times that come my way.
And then there's the enemy around
who wants to make me lose my ground
for earthly treasures;
all the wrong paths that I could take.
But I've decided that my goal
is to give you sole control,
and to love you because you've done just so much for me.
Oh, you've set my spirit free,
and you've cared so faithfully.
I want to know you,
and everything that you are.

Repeat Chorus

I never knew life could be so tough,
or that this race would be so rough.
But though I struggle,
I know I'll be alright in the end.
Cause everytime that I fall down,
you have always been around
to be near me; to wrap me up in your arms again.
How you shower me with grace
everytime I see your face,
and you love me.
So that I don't want to do wrong.
So to you I sing this song,
and I pray for help to keep on going,
never stop, oh yeah.

Repeat Chorus

Oh,through my life story,
I want to give you glory.
Life tries to bring me down,
for your love, I'll stand my ground.
Your heart has received me,
and you will never leave me.
No time to play the games,
now that I know that you came to save me.
Nah, nah, nah, nah....
Ooh, ooh...

Repeat Chorus",Giving My All
Out of Eden,"I've been down and out wondering what it all about
So many pressures and the burden seemed too much for me to bear
I tried to fight it, but there were shackles on my hands
Tried to deny it, 'til oppression took command
Turned to the Savior and He opened up my eyes
It caught me by surprise, told me somethin' that was no lie
Chorus:
It's a good time, a good time to be free
It's a good time, time to get free inside
It's a good time, a good time to believe
It's a good time, time to get free inside
Now you're down and out wondering what your life's about
Try to laugh your fears away, so you party everyday
What you are feeling, there ain't nothing new to find
What you don't know is, your life is on the line
Time to discover, there's so much more to this than just the way you live
I know someone with freedom to give
(chorus)
So let your spirit hear, and put your mind behind
There's a freedom that only in Him you'll find
If you heed the call you will have all you need
'Cause who the Son sets free you know is free, free indeed

What do you want to do with your life
Its up to you, you've got to decide
There's freedom here if you want it, just make up your mind

Out of Eden,"All of my life I've dreamed a love would come to me
It's here and now I know it's more that and other love could be
I never though I'd know someone who loved me so
To go as for to die that His love for me would show
I searched all over but I still couldn't find
Someone to give me love to heal my hurt and ease my mind
I sought affection tried everything new
Didn't even know that I was lost without a clue
Chorus:
You have opened my eyes to a greater love
You have opened my eyes to a greater love
I used to be so blind but now it's clear to me
How your love was displayed by what you did on Calvary
I've got to tell the world that they might hurt you
To find what I've found to really see how
You have captured my soul, you have made me whole
You have set me free 'cause I have given you control
You have mended my heart and I have been redesigned
Lord with everything you are, you have been blowin' my mind

And you know He's rearranged my life

We search for logical solutions to problems we cannot hide
We hope and pray the curse of war will be undone
And that the world will be as one
But we can't change it on our own, it takes more

Then and only then can we live in perfect harmony
Only if and when we sacrifice our comfort for the least of these
Get together down on our knees and pray God give us peace
Then and only then
We need to stop looking on ourselves and look to the One who know all
He has the answers that can rebuild us, a foundation that will not fall
We hope and pray the curse of hate will be no more
But it may be different
At least we know what the power of prayer is for, let's unite

As my sadness mounts I pray that this day will end

And you need someone to be there 
In your time of need 
You can turn your eyes to the heavens
And their creator's watching over you

You're in the midst of heartache
Perhaps you've lost a loved one
Lost all your faith-can barely pray

No one's bothered at all to give you what you need

On your own now, doing your own thing

Out of Eden,"[Rap by Knowdaverbs:]
I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's
I begged and I begged, of course she said no
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade
It's crazy how we place these small things as important
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's
Rivers that is, not the be	-ball player, told the mountains to
Move and now there's no more Himalayas
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now
With all of the joy deep inside
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go
Feels like life has just begun

I'm a scream from the rooftops, freckled face figment, light
Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen
It twice, propelling, stopping swelling by applying bags of ice
I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know
There's a lot to overcome
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go
You will feel like life has just begun

[Rap by Bonified:]
I got to keep moving and never carry the weight
Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness

I think I'm gonna just sit back and meditate.
You have given me all that I need.
And there is no way, no one compares to you.
No way, no one compares to you to me.

My tower in times of refuge,
my source of life and peace.
Your love, it falls like raindrops,
and never seems to cease.
You're the God of all creation,
you're the lover of my soul.
Given me the air that I breathe,
no way I could ever let you go, so I
So I give thanks to you
More than just for everything you've done,
but for how you've shown me you're the one that I
can put my trust into.
So no matter who it is that calls,
I'm not leavin' til your spirit falls on me.

[Chorus]

Who could I have in heaven, Lord, but you?
There's no one, there's no one.
Tell me, who could be who you are and do what you do?
Your beauty Lord, I long to see, see.
In your presence I find joy and peace,
so to be close to you, yeah.

[chorus]

Better is one day in your courts.
Better is one day in your house.
Than a thousand somewhere elses
I could never do without.
Your grace and your mercies,
the air that I breathe;
your promises are residing abundantly.",Meditate
Out of Eden,"Can you just give me a second please?
I would like to give my testimony
How the Lord has met my every need
How he saved me, made me holy

If you want to know the reason why
I gave it all, this life's no longer mine
How He made a way kept me alive
Well, listen close as I testify

You don't know like I know
You can't tell it like I can tell it
Everything the Lord has done for me so
That you understand, I'm just gonna say it

(What matter of love is this)
(That the Father gives to us)
How he saved my soul
I want the world to know

So know I sing
Just want to sing His praise
Loving kindness everyday
Faithfulness that come my way

I'm gonna clap my hands
Please excuse me if I start to dance
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new
He's been so good to me

He didn't have to do it but I'm glad He did
Saved me from my sin
That old life is gone and new life lives within
(Of all the things that I could, I write a song)
I knew I couldn't go wrong
If I sang of His goodness all day long

You don't know like I know
You can't tell like I can tell it
Everything the Lord has done for me so
That you understand I'm just gone say it

(I cannot live my life without Him)
I made no excuse, if I get a little crazy
In Him I live and more

So know I sing
Just want to sing His praise
Loving kindness everyday
Faithfulness that come my way

I'm gonna clap my hands
Please excuse me if I start to dance
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new
He's been so good to me

So clap your hands this evening
Come on y'all said it's alright
Move a little this evening
Come on y'all I said it's alright

You know is free indeed, you're free
You've got the need to be praisin'

Out of Eden,"I tuned in to the tv once again today
Watch the news to educate my mind
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me
It's our world caught in it's own demise

The situation worsens every day that goes by
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes

Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat
(I know God hears us crying out)
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I

Just to see some hope in your eyes

There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I

Out of Eden,"Lord,I really don't know how to write a song.
I'm not always eloquent, sometimes I get it wrong.
But the thing you're doing in me, I can't describe.
What a fool I'd be if I chose to hide
this transformation, new motivation.
Thought that we were close; I've known you all this time.
But I was just living life my way, just getting by.
Thought that if I do a good deed or two,
that'd be enough to please you.
I kept the parts I wanted to,
and missed out on the real you.

Now, with every step and every breath,
I give it all; hold nothing back.
With all I am, this is my choice
to live to worship you.
So, with all my heart, my soul, my mind;
I'll love you, leave it all behind.
To live my life in awe of you
is the least that I can do.

I've held on so long to all my hopes and dreams.
While you were asking me to place them all at your feet.
Let my praise be more than a song I'll sing for you.
Let me change all my ways in response to you.
I've lived for myself, Lord, I need your help.
Not I who lives, but You.

For you are worthy of all honor.

You've touched my heart, and now I see

Out of Eden,"Sittin' on the front porch, waitin' for you to come home
Visions of reuniting in my head
Only bitter-sweet memories, no holidays, no Christmas trees
Broken promises I have instead
How I used to wonder where did I go wrong, how you could've stayed away so long
That God for my mother hers was no easy song
Thank God that He showed me, how to get along

My papa was a rolling stone, abandoned us & left us lone
And how it broke my heart and home & had me losin' faith
Somebody saw what I went through and understood, had been there too
So glad they introduced me to, my Father
Your story sounds a lot like mine, it's a story told a thousand times
Someone hurting leaves in dis-array

But don't you know that God made you, more valuable than they ever knew
You know you can live past their mistakes
How you sit and wonder, how could all this be, someone that you loved so much
Just turn their backs and leave
Oh You need the lover of your soul and He is able to take care of you
Find He will never leave
Your papa was a rolling stone, abandoned you and left you lone

And how it broke your heart and home and has you losing faith
I'm seein' what you've going through: I understand, I've been there too
So let me introduce you to my Father
No longer, solid ground under my feet
I know what my life is worth, no longer incomplete

I'd rather use my mind, oh

Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly, Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul, though dearest friends depart
And all is darkened in the vale of tears;
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,
Who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears.
Be still, my soul; thy Jesus can repay
From His own fulness all He takes away.

4. Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

And shimmer like the sun

Free, that's what we're meant to be
To run and laugh and love and dance and sing
A volatile concoction of gratitude and grace
It's contagious, that's a beautiful thing

So don't go entertaining doubts
Just pack them up and throw them out
We're making room for love to live inside

Through your head like water running

And now I'm waiting for some momentum
Because this journey comes with few guarantees

Of what happens in between
Between the start and the finale
What will become of me?

Waiting for a sign
Praying for a single song with a catchy rhyme

To take me out of limbo

Me the moth and He the flame

To urge myself on in this way

And I know you're there
You promised me, yeah

I'm not waiting for a signal

And maybe with a bit-bit more luck
You can get picked up from wherever you lie

They saying it’s important that I live up to the hype
I don’t give in to the fame or fall into a vice
So lemme shine a light on who is Outasight
Used to hop up on the train with nothing really doing
This path that I’m pursuing, well I didn’t really chose it
It actually chose me but easily confusing
And I made some mistakes but to error is human
Wake up in the morning and all alone
Every single night somewhere unknown
Been around the world but can’t find home
You don’t know what you got oh till it’s gone
When you watch the clock, those days get long
Wish I could help but you’re on your own, you don’t know

What you ask for, what you needing, hope you getting yours ‘cause I’m getting mine

I think my timing right
Pursuing what I’m doing, not losing sleep at night
Maybe there’s some trouble when you get out of the huddle
And no one is behind you ‘cause they never really loved you
Not gonna raise my voice or even start a scuffle
Under pressure I don’t buckle, just belt songs so what up?
With your mumbling and grumbling, I’d hate to be a fuck up
And I played my cards right and it don’t seem like my luck up
Yet wake up in the morning on the wrong side of bed
Bunch of missed calls, inbox at the brim
One day the future bright, the next it feels dim
You don’t know what you got oh till it’s gone
Three hours sleep but I party till dawn
Hit the snooze a couple times, kill the alarm, you don’t know

From the moment you’re here to the moment you’re gone
Every second in between to making things right

I said so what? You got a little something on the high end
But does it ever really make you feel good? Got something to say?
Yeah, I said so what? They trying to put you down on the low end
But do they ever really-really feel good? Got something to say? Yeah

What happens when your material things become immaterial?
Does the fear in you bring you the same type of adrenaline
A few thousand hearing you sing or does it bring you to your knees
While you’re clearing your brain? I know I’m after the same
Treading water after every offer that has came
Trying to be myself in the valley of the fake
Trying to fix myself up, every hour could break
And when the times get easier, now they all needing you
Following the leader to the promised land
A modest man I was before, I won the war
And when things were difficult, no one ever gave a fuck
Maybe skill, maybe luck, either way I made it up and so what? So what?

[Chorus]

Where do you go when everyone is gone?
The same people who first appeared when you got on
It ain’t equal to the years that made it seem so long
For you to achieve the damn things you knew all along
And I battled the same, so original, they couldn’t give my style a name
Now there’s a million me’s but only one runs the lane
And scores points with honesty, I ain’t after the fame
And when it came to the breaking point, people raised they hands
So I had to make a point, roll it up and fold it up
I walked into the joint and made it mine and when it boiled to particulars
Getting down or living it up or giving it up
Or giving a who knows, where, how and what or maybe why

I said so what? You got a little something on the high end
But does it ever really make you feel good? Got something to say? Yeah",So What

Running and running but I'm never scared
You better Pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you Understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

Welcome to my story
Before the songs before the glory
There was a boy, didn't count as boring
Who let go with the fear he's holding
Walk down of all his classes
Followed his so called passion
Everyone said he was crazy
And they were right but that was back then

I'm sure you know the feeling when your hands reach the ceiling
I'm losing all my worries
This sky is in the hurries
Ya back on the chase
Once in a bill gotta slow your pace
Take a look around and appreciate all the good things that come to those
Who wait

[Chorus]

I'm taking a stand I hope you understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

If I fall down x3

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down",If I Fall Down
Outasight,"Whenever 
Wherever 

Back then everybody got a plan 
Everybody got a chance 
At their hollow dream 
Bright lights big city 
Go ahead take a step and get up on that screen 
Don't start to believe everything you see you better watch your company 
Cause so called friends 
Start showin' colours at the end 
Honestly 

So le let's go,Don't be afraid 
Of the unknown I cannot tell 

If this is real 
Or really hell 
Anything not nailed down 
let's sell Away and not look back 
Cut and paste And overlap 
Any moment I'm bout to crack 
with no way to glue it back. 

Whenever 
Wherever 
Does leaving make it better? 
Let's go, Let go, let's go, let's go 
if what you say is true. 
Whenever, wherever 
If leaving makes it better, Let's go x4 
And Count me in with you 
I remember when no one cared and people just stared and doubted me 
Feels like nothing much has changed except my own sanity 
Can't put my finger on, What it could have been or what it had to be 
huh, Its all hearsay now so when I paint my masterpiece 
All that glitters ain't gold, another story gets told, 
Bout an underdog trying to overcome some issue they cant get a hold, 
Of, and moving right along to another sad place and another sad time 
Put a quarter in the jukebox 
And say goodbye to the world you thought was fine. 

Someone told me about this place 
We don't need a fucking thing 
Whose gon' recognize your face 
No one's gonna know your name 
Call me when you get the guts 
Forget about whose to blame 
Whenever ever you want to leave I'll leave",Let's Go
Outasight,"All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
For nights like these!
All our lives we're waiting, waiting, waiting
For nights like these!

Turn the lights down low
I don't wanna see the crowd cause I know
I made a bunch of calls tonight
To everyone I know, but no one could go.

What you think it's gonna happen?
Straight in the island of Manhattan
Couple struggling, standing there, clapping
Like who the hell is this rapping?

Fast forward years later
Jump right in without a life savior
Mind the details and... major
And I don't know what's next, but my mind seems made up

See what happens now
Is anyone care, so I'm asking around
And I'm starting from my... and I'm crashing down
And I'm on my own this time around

All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Oh for nights like these!
All our lives we're waiting, waiting, waiting
For nights like these!

Turn our radio loud
I close my eyes now, I see the whole crowd
Open out and start looking now
Like damn, this is weird, what a hell I do know?

A long ways for the long days
Trained to the city, walk a long pro way
Back down a long hallway
Hum for myself another song like always!

Just a care from the... that got lost in
The lights in town just blurred
That's why I keep going and the fire still burning
I found something... now I move forward

See what happens now
Does anyone care, so I ask around
I'm starting from my... I'm crashing down
I'm on my own, I crash around!

All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

Ah, she takes a look in the mirror but can't recognize who's staring back (back) 
Couple of years bad luck with more down and ups like the glass that crack, 
Bright lights in the city what a pity that I don't recall your name
In every single town, we think we overcame,
The clouds come around and it fall some rain.

I mumble out the words, jumbled inside my head
It's time to make things better but they get worse instead
When your left to fight some things that never end,
Well do this again

[Chorus]
You'll say what I am (I am), Ill say what I'm not (I'm not)
You know I'm no good when it's on the spot,
I've looked everywhere to find the perfect words.
Oh ohh, oh ohh, oh ohh, oh ohh.
You'll say what I am (I am), Ill say what I'm not (I'm not)
You know I'm no good when it's on the spot,
I've looked everywhere to find the perfect words.

Yo, take one look in the review, can't recognize what's staring back,
If the past is the past, I can't hang from now so cut me some slack
And it's easy to jump than get up and walk so we sit around and wait
For the words to come up that might inspire us,
To stop fucking up and change our fate

I mumble out the words, jumbled inside my head
You're looking for answers, I'm looking for a pair
I'm gonna sleep this one away and come back in the end
Well do this again

[Chorus]

At the corner store, the liquor store or around the block
Go the wind down town or at the mall at the check out stop
I search far and wide and try to find the little things
That I can say back to you to make everyone understand

Outasight,"Let's go!
Yeah, out the corner of my eye
I see the red light and I don't slow down
Down! Turn the one to see up ahead
Some place, some... that I don't go 'round

Another digging is this worth the time?
And it crossed my mind, somehow it's in vain
But I guess it's one step, and then goes the next
Can I get a good trick so that we can change?

And I remember when everyone said,
""You can't do it, get it out your head!""
And I remember when they said, ""Don't try it!""
It ain't gonna make it, not, not this time!

Huh, I'm sorry you're wrong
And this the moment that I choose to cease
I used to wake up in a cold, cold sweat
And this cold cold world, now figure that please

I'm sorry this time
I'm not waiting or holding on!
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo

In the back of my mind I stop to decide if this worth the fight
Right, keep her talking about the little things
When the big picture don't seem so bright!
Right! So flip on this
And push on all your way from the edge
But I guess it's one step and there goes the next
So I'm trying to get back from off that ledge!

And I remember when everyone said,
""You can't do it, get it out your head!""
And I remember when they said, ""Don't try it!""
It ain't gonna make it, not, not this time!

Uh, and I'm sorry I'm wrong
You can drag it, next, next time
Take a number and wait another summer
On the back of the so called line, that's fine!

I'm sorry this time
I'm not waiting or holding on!
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Let's go! That's right, let's go!

This word that we're living in it's going wrong
Just trying to make sense and pay my rent
Get back every cent that's ever been
I promise to remember you now that you're gone

You never know when you can possible end this
Critics don't fall and the music don't spin
No! The music don't spin
No! The music don't spin
Here comes the end!

Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo
Ready set go! Gooo, gooo, gooo

We're about to
When we're
And I'm moving alone

Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, pull his file, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do, but no (no, no)
I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away, this ain't goin' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome

I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we goin' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix, yeah
It was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae, ya big enough nuts, retreat

From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip

Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking up and throwing 'em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clowning mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm making 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to forehead of niggas trying to serve us
To graduate is really becoming a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly trying to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is getting smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thing with a G swing
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruising down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam

Don't flex on next, I break necks too
Rollin with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

Yeah, I'm steady bucking motherfuckers
Not ducking 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Player shit is how I'm kicking it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a player
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a player, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string cause off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no players in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throwing to do more load, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with something wicked
But you can't feel it, sticking out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay.
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain,
Don't cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's getting horrid
The hunting child is on the prowl, yeah!
I let out a call to the wild

OutKast,"Well it is I, the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hoe sellers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now, to big felon

I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me

All heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me
Growin up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you fly when niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when I'm slanging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working niggas butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on dankin'
'cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey then they swing but shit they missed me huh
I'm getting nice with them things, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and yes my man I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear em
And shoot my dice like it's the brick the way that wall done flicks em
Nigga, so ring around the roses diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters count em nigga fuck a nine
See I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes and drive bys
Kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayanora suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be bopping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties

Got a type of nugget, blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping, it's simply marvelous time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mon be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit, to take another hit so hit it
Of the canibus seteva weed reefer yeah smoke shit
It's all day any til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world peace

We, is gonna smoke out, until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be burying
Coming around my shop with that see nigga you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting I be having your posse ducking nothing but
King Shit, I am asking, sucker can you hand
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle motherfucker don't be crying on me

D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P. I'll take ya D.E.E.P.
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage that's when I got my folks hooked like

[Dre]
Deeper than deep dish hammers and vogues
Deeper fish in the ocean
I got my gun I'll stamp out like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like herb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching blades
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggason they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see Afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your motherfucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end
Andre 'gain slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts
So you know that it's D.E.E.P.

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Boi]
Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody, I got's the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, some I'ma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'ma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P.
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like

[Chorus: x2]

[Dre]
No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm truly bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having fun
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I get a little backup
Please don't let them pussy motherfuckers put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we need dough
Whenever the fuck out record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back

I'm getting D.E.E.P. like a prostitute's vagina
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggas try to bite their shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Dough boy
And I don't give a damn, motherfucker cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hear me bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tightest draws cause I got a solid fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking ""gimme some"", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt

See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by

I used to sling a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp

Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light (Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball

Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them draws and I told her bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit

I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that jive

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up

I've been slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish your behind
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it's the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickels act strong
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A. Niggas, ain't no gankin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you want to battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo, niggas gonna how we tote
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper that Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm flinging it from the south
Talk bad about the A town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth

Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flow
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the begin
And now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me

Quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets

Then I yell ho
We knocking em off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house, house like a joint is lit fo my kin folks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong

It's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

Well okey dokey KastOut
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic coupe de ville
Can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge p-u-m-p
You want to do a jack
I heat the barrel til it's empty, get me
See I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit

Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball yup
So now I step
Rather walk with the pimp
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue
The sun is beaming it seeming
That I glisten, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Full of pride

Young girls thirteen years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
 
But every now and then, I wonder
If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming POW!

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Bend, corner's like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern player serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out-you-scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box, and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen

Or will it know to be the hard regardless of the skintone
I really feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone

Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team
And like the daddy's wife you making the coffee
You heard the A-T-L-iens
So back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

Exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on

Put yo hands in the atmosphere

Now give it back lawd
Cause that's like backboards without the rims

Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born

That my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams

Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come

It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up

I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men

But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat

Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things

That I just came from, some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout
Smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?""
""No not really"" But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive? I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man, but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat, like you live check-to-check

A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""Outkast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""

OutKast,"Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that man fuck them niggas I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinking it's better for em
When they can let they thumb down from hitch hiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time
They get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed and every single day was personal FreakNik
Freaking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes I see
You weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs
Leaving deposits keep your closets open knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan
Cause you thinking that you my lady bitch don’t play me cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don’t even know your name
It’s a shame, you cracking em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me see
I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I’m saying

See me and ol' girl, in the black on black 'Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my
Furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl
Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Now they dykeing

Having no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be
I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he, faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi user and abuser",Jazzy Belle
OutKast,"Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see
Visions from me
At twenty three making us free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga sellin', but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
In fair times so writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

They swan divin'
Fit they name be thrashing an album
Go-kart rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?
Be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal
Me crud ball business giving niggas inches so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process momma moping like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies of the street tinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to obtain another level of con-science
Only to test, to poke and see
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
? with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But a missile will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the court showing paper thin
Got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

Everybody's a player, rubbing them Kangols on their head
Thinking its all about your clothes, nigga its all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream",Mainstream
OutKast,"Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing, back and forth
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt

See, from bed knobs to broomsticks, we looking to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from west Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, ""I'm proud of you peoples
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black""
Shit, on the real, that's how them whiteys really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart
You looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour

Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's

Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen things
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talkin' like that, man f*** them n****z I'm goin' off
And comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw em

With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' n****s
Until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends

Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught poked
Like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas

Of our chillun, they f***in' a different n**** every time
They get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my senorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay

House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real Jazzy Belle...

[Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no slouch
Havin' the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smokin' an ounce of weed yeah every single day was personal FreakNik
Freakin' these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it

But your conception, deception, lookin' into your eyes I see
Your weapon and it's depressin', they're diggin' up in your thighs
Leavin' deposits keepin your closets open knockin' your boots and jaws
Hopin' to get you sprung like bell-bottoms, steadily callin' me Antwan

'Cause you thinkin' that you my lady b**** don't play me cause you're chanky
I wanted to hit that a** but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, you runnin' that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a n**** don't even know yo name

It's a shame, you crackin' em up and f***in' a n**** like Tupac up
I'm leavin' these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me see
I gotta be feedin' my daughter, teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I'm sayin?

[Andre, Big Boi]
One two, yessss, ummkay, check this out right here now
See me ain't no good, in the black on black Ã¯Â¿Â½Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her n**** guaranteed to snap like bra

Strap stickin' together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog eat dog world, kitty cats be scratchin' on my
Furry coat to curl, up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, cause most of the girls that we was likin'
In high school, now they dykein' *laughin*

Havin' no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hangin' around the crew lookin' for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be, askin' me all about mine
How she doin' how she be, I know she's sippin' that wine

Behind my back they skwak like vultures
Off and On like Trendz of Cultures baby
Hey he, fakin' it like these sculptured, nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer

OutKast,"Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said
Get on the bus go get your work
And keep your beeper chirpin' is a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch
Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff
Provided to you by sack man
Pac man how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man & ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times
And swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners
That we be bending in Volkswagens and Bonnevilles
Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fucking beeper bill bitch

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died twice
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors & baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad need some hope
Like the words maybe, if, or probably more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught in appearance
It's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear that can't come near that maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends

OutKast,"Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too""
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on and get, the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above (aww man)
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

It's like that now, you better go on and get, the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now","Da Art of Storytellin', Pt. 1"
OutKast,"""Baby, did you hear that?"" ""Yeah, baby, I heard it too""
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done

Who says good folks ain't supposed to die?

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making my way on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at the dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

Who says good folks ain't supposed to die?
All's well, nothing's well","Da Art of Storytellin', Pt. 2"
OutKast,"Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella cause young fella it gets no weirder

We reign, reign supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my lord

To make one bob they head would be the track job
Tour job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhyming for granted I won't comply
With that slacking, popping and cracking 4th ward way we snapping
They won't that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happening, see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lacking, when I see you nigga packing
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car do'
But you still stay with mom though playing the King like Don doe
You chocked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be locked up
Makin them thick Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg

And there's a, and there's a fine, line 
Too late to pray that I'm on it
Ya yeah yeah 

Y'all, uh huh, y'all 

There's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Came way too late but baby I'm on it
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Can't wait too late but baby I'm on it
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see 
That's Liberation and baby I want it
Can't worry bout, what another nigga think 
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end 
So people keep your head to the sky

Shake that load off, shake that load off

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to voice how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen 
Just by rapping

Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink
And your girl done got to thinking
She talking bout, ""Girl you look so beautiful""
You say thank you being nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do, you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall

Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico, DeBarge
He large and got a 'Llac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd
One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoise, my watch, my car
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far

Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow

I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin the bills so you gon' do it

Before our gangsta ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talking cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothing that ain't been done before
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got

They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well I've never been there; well perhaps once
But I, was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hard core
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set it Off,"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
""Hey hey look baby they playin' our song""

Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance (sliced up)

Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the

Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss

OutKast,"February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They comin around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-strang
Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern

Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playin' married
Or paying child support

Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport

Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on judgment day

Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything in life don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen

Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
You livin for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""Oh hell naw!""  But yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?  Whoo!
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision.. is,
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then 1 day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life

To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed

But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

Tootin like it's cool bein a fool, and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall

Lookin like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speakin about these pros cause you know nothing bout that man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin about the beatin, this my ends is never met, nigga

Black man, white man, Jew man ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older now we up against the ropes
Yeah they kickin niggas door down; cause it ain't no dope on the streets

And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin about that Southern sess, nigga you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin but dead nigga

Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
In the junction, in the junction
Don't you dare ever get lost cause you get caught up in that sauce

So mayday, may Dre, knock 'em up off they ass boi

We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know

Yappin about this crew you run wit
Bankhead bouncin to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come wit?

Yes, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in ""My Adidas""
So Run like D.M.C. is me and no, don't got no heater

Well we zippin around the corner in that golden stankin Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin to take it
Pullin the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot

Well, they come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five, is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep, I couldn't sleep until I seen it

Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this

What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of please we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
Till ain't nothing but Stankonia

OutKast,"Have you heard the news today
They say a little 14 year old little girl had a baby on the way
Too much for her little mind to bare
And that type of news to her mama she cannot spare

Toilet Tisha, damn we miss ya
Toilet Tisha is the issue
Damn we miss ya, Toilet Tisha
Damn we miss ya

Don't go away
Don't you dare go away from me girl I can help you
Don't go away dont you dare leave me
Don't go away, away
Don't go away

Five thousand, one hundred ten days
Is a short period of time a mere fourteen years
On this precious mother earth, you see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in it's early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I cant, I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale,
Cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling
To her mam or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose

I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollipop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentrality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty p's of that work

Take a little trip, hater pack up yo' mind
Look forward not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin at the airpo't
who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss
Mami I'm comin I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself

To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is goin' downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leg lock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin'
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin'
The unforgiven or the unwillin', live a life of sinnin'
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin

But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah...

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foorrr?
Ow!

Life, is nothin' but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're bein' evil then you on the devil's team
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible

And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me

You won't let me drown and I'm grateful

At home you get low down for me

Hoo! You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown

Pressed like Levi's toughskins, on minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin'
Bustin' d-boy raps and player poems
The ""Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em
Your life show consists of eveybody's shit but you're-uns
Do you own shit! In your life show (bitin ass nigga)

With her Eye's Wide Shut, before I ashed to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde, I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake, and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on, clap off clop on
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
And your team looking shitty to death

My nigga Big Boi said ""Watch 'em as they gawk and they gander""
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard
You can have The Whole World
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, over stand
This young player's line
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word, and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine, Aquemini's
Murderous monster move minds
Did it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time, holla one-time
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time (one-time)

To run yo' tennis shoes
Don't, it, matter to you

Keep that funk for y'all

As a interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops

Dudes want to know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!
Why that, why this, niggas want to hijack the flyness

A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin'

Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this earth this
Planet's standards to me they have no purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
No possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear
We disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like

That was just some head, and head don't count right?

Well, I just feel like,

But not too slow

And life ain't easy
You know you just want somebody by your side to help smooth that thang out
You know what I'm talking bout?
And, at this point
I mean I am not being picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass, you know
Just something well proportioned to her body
You know a nice little tail, you know

You say, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute?

I just want to say Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see
Cupid grabs the pistol (Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here!)
He shoots straight for your heart
Now, and he won't miss you!
But that's alright y'all won't believe in me anyways

You won't believe in me, but you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny!

Every day the 14th! (You got it!)
When Cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me!
There's no need to run!
So, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!)

Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean
Well, somebody tell me!
'Cause they just don't believe in me!

You won't believe in me, but you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny!

Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand 'cause I use to be a bad boy in my day
I know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Oh oh!

You won't believe in me, but you would fancy
(Hey! Don't you supposed to be some kind of player or something?)
Bunny!

Well keep on runnin', playa
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So, you're going to find out tonight!

Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I give up my heart, but
Never know because shit, I never tell her!
Ask me how I'm feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'
And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but
For the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to take me to Pluto?
I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse
Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples of why you're the shit!
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?

Well here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!)
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb

And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards

All you got in the frigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life right?

Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night, ain't nothing right or wrong!

Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda
Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob
For a little less than a yard, a massage you could drill her like a sarge

She would charge and rob
Pick through yo' pockets
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license

On the night stand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forge,t you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction

Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously, the was a knock on the sliding glass door (bitch, it's me!)
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit!

Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You look at me like yeah nigga right
But you gave me you number anyway you were on the talcum
Powder, how's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I paged you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I'm thinking I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me folly if your hometown would be
Heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possess made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling cracks sack by sack so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled ho
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Pack full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold ?
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much ?cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you want to be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time keep it real was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When spring break
And Daytona
And Freakniks
Made you want to
Drop out of college and never go back

Well you knew him as Twan
That's right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sort of was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak

She was about 2 the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause I started the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see I'd balled out, and before I fall I'd
Slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain is that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread-Never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangsters, bitches, rastas, and macoroni niggas ? impostors
So on a trip to New York on some biz wax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in this world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her
As Erykah on and on Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone why you
Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven
And he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To one luxury transportation in a Marta car
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard

You give it all your time because that's all you can think about

Why can't the story end like fairy tales often do
Before I let you leave I've got to say

Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here, and actually I think it's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
Call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like

I think I'm in love again

Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a manatee
Baby you are the prototype
I think I'm

I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

The Scene
Come here

I think I'm in love again

Girl, right now I want to say, I want to say
I want to say stank you very much
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world
I can't, I'm not
I can't afford to not record
I thank I want to say
I thank I want to say stank you, stank you
Smelly much!
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world

Really? Were we recording just then?

OutKast,"Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living, breathing, soon we'll be teething
Our granny got a goal and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint
Reset

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Good does not come without pain
Meaning, before it gets better, it's going get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dying over turf
That don't belong to us
I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thing, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on
Guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thing

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right
You'll get used to singing if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

OutKast,"Hold up!
Oh, oh! Somebody done told you you wrong!

Ok, I start out all alone
`Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned!
Well it's some real shit and I'm lving it through this song!
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me!
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win!

Throw your neck out! Throw your back out!

Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a parrty? Not hardly!! I'm trying to stay up outta that womb!
Or that p-you-s-s uss! I said uss!
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid!
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold!
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart!
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign!

Throw your neck out! Throw your back out!

K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed!
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CD's
Baby please, you make me want to scream!
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?

Throw your neck out! Throw your back out!",The Rooster

All the guys would say she's mighty fine(Mighty fine!)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cussed out, or coming up short.
Yeah, now dig this, even though(Even though!)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide(To divide!)
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah!

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink

I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, craaash.. into a ditch! (Just Playing!)

Well she's got a hotty's body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said ""Pardon me, are you ballin'?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pursing""
Oh so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game, been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek, ah, quick way to eat,
Ah, neat place sleep, ah, rent-a-car for a week, ah, trick for a treat..Noo
Go, on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved without our lawyers

A pain
But she's alive

The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A pain
But she's alive

I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what
I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do.
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on

Young age
No help

To raise
At, at a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive

He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them

Young age

Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

I, I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour your..
Your, yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but peoples don't lie
And if they do, by God, they must fry! (fry?!)
You know, like electric chair
The way you stare (yeah I'm there)
You committed a crime and I'm the victim

I've got an eye out for she who cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settling down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, fuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chislom
Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them
Tell your home girls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000, hard!

Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain, so
Spread, spread for me

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Riding it like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playing rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rapping lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb

You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by giving hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch

Fuck the cops, we making noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's going drop

Mr. Cockerspanielle in your poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props

""So here he is, get the fuck on the ground""
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you want to romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
Been a while, it's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred tho, bitch, diamonds shimmering
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb

Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, over throwed
Now we got seven more points on the board, for sure
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we going show it to your ass
""You're a champion"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre""
I say ""people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay""
