The Guess Who,"Sidemen come out first
John Stockfish base guitar
Looks at the world through the eyes of Nashville,
The Riverboat and Charlie McCoy
He's just a boy

The lead guitarist Red Shea who's really come a long, long way
Since rhythm rocker jingle jangle
And go Red!

And Lightfoot
Edwardian, suddenly striped
His hair blondish and poetic
He is less than vinyl perfect
His foot is a precise anchor for the husk and vibrance of his voice

He is the image of Alberta
The side street near Chicago
The grim beauty of Toronto

He is an artist
He is an artist
He is an artist painting Sistine masterpieces of pine and fur and backwoods
Still echos long ago the winter night of black July and then the outcome
Of an early Cleveland rainfall

I sit softly among the rest waiting there for him to paint his pictures
And as the go-go girl went round and our heads were in a spin 
I thought about the Crossroads, in the early morning rain and Rosanna
I'm not saying that I'm sorry
I'm just telling you this story
And when Lightfoot's magic calls
You can write it on your walls
Cause that's what walls are for

He is an artist.",Lightfoot
The Guess Who,"Miss Fudge is only waiting for a man to come her way
She has been waiting 80 years for Mr. Maple but he doesn't know that she is waiting too
It's nothing new

Mr. Maple gets up early every morning cooks his breakfast all alone the house is cold
He needs a woman's hand to comfort him in his reclining years
He overhears

The people on the street they pass him by and sort of snicker
In his younger years he should have been a little quicker
For in the hand of someone he could love but who's to judge
If he'll ever have a meeting with Miss Fudge

Miss Fudge's hopes were fading that a man would come her way
She had been darning no ones socks and when the years crept up her misery
Just slowly pushed her on
And now she's gone

Mr Maple's life alone was just too much for him to bear
And in his heart he knew there'd never be someone to comfort him at times he cried
And then he died

But everything is better now
They're both at last together
The question now is answered for all those who wondered whether
They each at last had found a friend and if they did misjudge
Their tombstones side by side read Maple Fudge",Maple Fudge
The Guess Who,"Can I be somewhere when I'm nowhere
Gaze through a diabetic eye
Can I put down the right to be put down
And never known the right to try

I'd leave and take my pride with me
And find something I could carry it in
But all that breaks the stillness here
Is the sound of a dropping pin.

From the silence
Deep within
Comes the sound
The sound of a dropping pin.

From the silence
Deep within
Yeah, deep deep within
Comes the sound
The sound of a dropping pin.

Can I be something when I'm nothing
Build my hopes and dreams too high
I've searched too long for all the answers
Let alone the right to try

To think that you can take it with you
Is the one unforgivable sin
But all that breaks the stillness now
Is the sound of a dropping pin.

From the silence
Deep within
Comes the sound
The sound of a dropping pin.

From the silence

Yeah, deep deep within

The Guess Who,"One divided in two directions

The Guess Who,"Well he moved out of the city from his little tiny place alone
Yes he moved out of the city from his little tiny place alone
So long Bannatyne, hello my Chevrier home.
Well now there might be a few things missin'

Like the Indians on a Saturday night
Yes there might be just a few things missin'
Like the odd hotel bar fight
So long Bannatyne, hello my Chevrier home.

Maybe in the summer I can build myself a rec room
And buy a power mower for the lawn,
Or maybe that depends on the orders from the office and accountants and the label and Don
The Emperor...

Hello my Chevrier
Hello my Chevrier
Hello my Chevrier adobe,

I'm so proud of it, speak so loud of it, always.
Yes I moved out of the city and I left my Bannatyne behind
Oh I moved out of the city and I left my Bannatyne behind
I really like it here,

The people are kind to me, at quarter to three
When I sail my red Chevy past the house on the breeze
I'm huggin' and a kissin' and a smoochin' and a lovin'
Ballin' and a partyin', fightin' day and night

And everybody knows that that's the way it goes,
So long Bannatyne.","So Long, Bannatyne"
The Guess Who,"Get on board 
The Reaper wants to take you all for a ride 
Get on board 
The Reaper wants to take you all for a ride 
His private train is leaving 
To slip you to the other side 

He's got cocaine and morphine too 
Lots of stuff to get you all high 
Little pink pills in a brown bag 
Truckin' off across the sky 

If you feel like a disaster when you wake up in the morning 
Nothing but a God damn monkey wrench inside your head 
Got some things to make you go faster, others make you go slower

The Guess Who,"What will become of the watcher

Whatever will happen to his soul
What will become of the watcher
When the band packs up
When the lights go out
When the band packs up and goes home

Left him sitting at his table
He could no longer raise his cane
All the people missed his message
When the band packed up
When the lights went out
When the band packed up and went home

His only friends lay in the ashtray
Each night he'd call them out by name
Before him always sat the same glass
And the town folk thought him quite insane

The Guess Who,"Don't want to listen to my telephone ring

Whatever happened to homes as opposed to houses?
The conversation, sayings as the evening drowses
It's just like four six two zero one
It's just like four six two zero one

Whatever happened to early morning urban skies?
And broken faces, half with melting eyes
Enough of riddles that just play with time
'Cause I'm still here and I can't beg a dime
I'm back here in four six two zero one
I'm back here in four six two zero one

The Guess Who,"Well I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

The Guess Who,"Is my world not falling down
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees

But you're from my side of town

Turn me off or turn me round

Sometimes I feel like a kid.

Restless diesels goodbye windows
In walked into such a sad time

At the station as I walked out
Felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness
In the hard crowd consolation for the old wounds
Now forgotten yellow tigers

The Guess Who,"It sure was scary
When I met Mary
I didn't understand myself
I was a fool when we were in school
And she understood me better
I guess I had passion
It startled her fashion
She thought it a small price to pay
For fiery nights under northern lights
Helps the snow slowly melt away

Herbert's a loser
His father's a boozer
He didn't like himself
He lost his cool and he drowned in a pool
After writing a classic love letter
I guess too much passion
Had startled his fashion
It started and ended that day
He wrote the letter there wasn't one better
One reading turned millions his way

Now there's Mary
It isn't so scary
Now that I like myself
I'm no fool and we're not in school

You have found her, now go and get her

Now it's time to find a better place
To find a safer place

I just wanna be left alone
What am I living for no one knows
I have lived to believe you would walk over me
When I'm dead and gone

Please, I don't wanna drive you down
But you better take a look around
And tell me what you've found

I just wanna be left alone
What am I living for no one knows
I have lived to believe you would walk over me
When I'm dead and gone

You can all walk over me
When I dead and gone

I just wanna be left alone
What am I living for no one knows
I have lived to believe you would walk over me
When I'm dead and gone

I just wanna be left alone
What am I living for no one knows
I have lived to believe you would walk over me
When I'm dead and gone

You think my life is full of
Fun and games and lemonade
Too long a day in the life

You think my life is full of
Fun and games and lemonade
Too long a day in the life
Too long a day in the life

Looking for you now, isolated
Conscience laden, beaten to the ground

Lost and jaded, nothing sacred
Watching as I drown, bleed or swallow
Beg and borrow, someone help me out

You give me everything that I need

I'm drowning but you keep on helping me breathe

Tripping blindly, slowly climbing
Never coming down, life below me
Flashing coldly, somehow holding on

You give me everything that I need

I'm drowning but you keep on helping me breathe

Out of my mind I'm falling
Deep into you
I hear your voice keep calling

Barely breathing
Slowly fading
Lost forever more

The Gufs,"We stood all alone
Waiting for this day to come
And I held you close
But I couldn't feel your pain

I didn't know
This would be the last time
This would be the last kiss
This was our goodbye

If you were letting go
I should've been the one you told
I never heard you say goodbye
And I'm sorry isn't good enough

Because lately I've been giving up
And I'm sorry isn't good enough
And your last goodbye
Made me realize

I'll be alright
How could you laugh?
How could you lie to me?
You held me close

But I couldn't feel your pain
I should've known
This couldn't last forever
The last thing I remember

Was standing all alone

My eyes are black holes and I'm burning away

You slaughtered your loving man, killed him in his sleep
The blood and crying of your murder simply stains the sheets

Now, you're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost to the living men
Trailing souls to the end

You thought winning as a woman, meant failing as a friend
It is not an art statement to drown a few passionate men

You made yourself a diamond to blind young men's eyes
You claim because they want your shine they deserve to walk the line

You're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost forever to the living men
Trailing souls till the end

Yes, I would give you my love so my soul would not starve
But it could never move the honest rock of what you are

You're a ghost on the highway
You're like straw and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
I'll carry that to the end

If I ever lie with you again, I pray I do not sleep
If I ever close my eyes again, I'd realize what you are to me
You are simply a liar
An animal who bluffs and steals
Until you become a bigger creature's meal

Tying up ourselves
But bleeding unlike diamonds

You made me warm when you hit me

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain",Singing in the Rain
The Hair,"She asks me why, I'm just a hairy guy
I'm hairy noon and night, hair that's a fright
I'm hairy high and low, don't ask me why, don't know
It's not for lack of bread, like the grateful Dead, darlin'

Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen
Give me down to there, hair, shoulder length or longer
Here baby, there, momma, everywhere, daddy, daddy

Hair, flow it, show it
Long as God can grow, my hair

Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas, in my hair
A home for fleas, a hive for the buzzing bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words
For the beauty, splendor, the wonder of my hair

Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow, my hair

I want long, straight, curly, fuzzy, snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
Oily, greasy, fleecy, shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka dotted, twisted, beaded, braided
Powered, flowered and confettied
Bangled, tangled, spangled and spahettied

Oh say, can you see my eyes if you can
Then my hair's too short
Down with here, down to there
Down till there, down to where it's stuck by itself

They'll be ga-ga at the go-go, when they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond, brilliantined, biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it, Hallelujah I adore it
Hallelujah Mary loved her son, why don't my mother love me?

Or see visions of the heavens
In the stumps of fallen trees?

Ran four wild dogs leaping over abandoned tires high into the air
In the air, in the air, someday I will live in the air 
Once I loved a girl named Joan 
Whose skin smelled just like falling snow
One day she drove us off the road into a dead field of corn
She laughed and hit the gas as we bounced across the rows
But I held onto the dashboard with my eyes tightly closed
Those wild dogs brought back that smell of falling snow 
And the girl who lives in Johnsburg across a bridge I can not cross",In the Air
The Handsome Family,"Tuesday at dawn, Michael's glasses washed ashore
With a styrofoam box and two broken oars
He'd been digging for clams in the muddy swamp weeds
When he heard the salt water whisper to him

Lie down, lie down in the dark, rolling sea
When you get to the bottom we'll kiss you to sleep
Lie down, lie down in the dark, rolling sea
When you get to the bottom we'll kiss you to sleep

Michael threw his glasses in the cold green water
Hermit crabs ran as he dove down under
One of his shoes bobbed on the waves
Seagulls circled 'til it finally sank

The Handsome Family,"Out in the heather where the sun burns bright 
She swore to love me the rest of her life
But, my hands they shook as the noon bells chimed 
So at the last bell I showed her my knife
And I laid to rest my beautiful bride 
Out in the heather where the sun burns bright
Now all alone under the cool night sky
Where locusts scream and white moths fly
Silvery moonbeams fall on her grave
But twisting black vines have covered her name
For I loved too much my beautiful bride 
And so gave her up to the cool night sky",My Beautiful Bride
The Handsome Family,"Poor, poor Lenore carried off by crows 
As she wandered alone where the red oaks grow
Black, black were their beaks twisted in her hair 
And black were their wings whipping up through the air
Fly, fly into the breeze, Lenore and the crows
To the top of a dead tree where the heartbroken go
Love, she fell in love with the grave digger's son 
Who was thin as the bow of his black violin
Kiss, he kissed so hard her mouth filled with blood 
Then he left her to cry where the red oaks die","Poor, Poor Lenore"
The Handsome Family,"Above the dark highway, on a black tar roof
Stood the sad milkman in love with the moon
She filled up his window with soft milky light
So he climbed up the chimney and into the night

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalk, a crowd gathered 'round
Throwing up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Crying up to the moonbeams, come let down your hair

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills
He wanted to fly up from the roof
Up through the night wind to the arms of the moon

The Handsome Family,"I had nothing to say on Christmas day 
When you threw all your clothes in the snow
When you burnt your hair, knocked over chairs
I just tried to stay out of your way
But when you fell asleep with blood on your teeth
I got in my car and drove away
Listen to me, Butterfly
There's only so much wine you can drink in one life 
And it will never be enough to save you from the bottom of your glass
Where the state highway starts I stopped my car
I got out and stared up at the stars

I thought about your sad, shining eyes
I came back for my clothes when the sun finally rose

The Handsome Family,"Up Falling Rock Hill where the leaves swoop like bats
I shot my brother William five times in the back
""Have mercy, have mercy, dear brother,"" he cried
But the wind has no mercy and neither did I

I watched as his blood ran through the damp grass
I watched as the black ants crawled through his hands
Up Falling Rock Hill, the wind softly moaned
And down, down came I with blood on my clothes

But the earth didn't open and the sky didn't fall

Sometimes it all seems to glow as bright

That douse electrical fires
Flaring up in nursing homes

The Handsome Family,"In the parking lot where I waited alone
A white bird sat sleeping on the broken pay phone
And up came a black beetle dragging off a green fly
Underneath a parked car and then out of sight

And I felt a dark eye turn its gaze upon me
As if the earth, the earth could see

A dark eye, a dark eye, a dark eye fell on me

In that parking lot where a prairie once grew
And through the tall grass, the buffalo flew
I heard something crying way down below
Where the sewer lines snake around Indian bones

In that parking lot, cars baked in the sun
And somewhere down the road, the pop of a gun
I watched a red ant crawl up my shin
And I felt so sad until it bit my skin

A dark eye, a dark eye, a dark eye fell on me

",A Dark Eye
The Handsome Family,"There's a blind man who hears angels
He hears them whispering in sacked potatoes
And from the curly leaves of blooming pants
And in the winding tracks of crawling ants

He stands outside, under the sky
Listening to starlight drifting by
Because gravity is not the only force at work
In this world

Just like gypsy moths and firebugs
Circle around a shining bulb

Into the darkness of outer space

And when he walks the city streets
He sprinkles the sidewalks with apple seeds
Because gravity is not the only force at work
In this world

Where jade water lilies grow

A supermarket parking lot
Last night as I drove home from work
Old men sleeping in the dirt

Abandoned buildings full of smoke
Children jumping from the roof
Cars in ditches leaking blood
Rivers full of drowning bugs

But as the sun fell between
The leaning buildings and the street

I've been living in the park
I'd rather talk to the wind
Than an empty apartment

And I wish I could forget
How a billion birds flew in
My hollow, dying heart
The first time I touched your arm

Once there were a billion passenger pigeons
So many flew by they darkened the sky
But they were clubbed and shot, netted, gassed and burned
Until there was nothing left but vines of empty nests

I can't believe how easily
A billion birds can disappear

It's so cold out
And all the paddle boats
Are covered up with snow

Once again it's dark

And throwing potato chips
Into the white snowdrifts

Crickets sang in crumbling walls
Termites ate through the doors
And rabbits hopped along the floors

The empty shelves swarmed with bees
Cash machines sprouted weeds
Lizards crawled the parking lot
Swallows flew the empty shops

And there was peace in the valley once again

Plants grew up the mannequins
Painting them with leafy skin
Clear plastic eyes fell to the floor
And were carried off by wild boars

All the mirrors cracked in half
When wild horses galloped past
And mourning doves built their nests
On the escalator steps

The Handsome Family,"I am eating hash browns in the snow white diner
Outside cars are honking, flashing lights on the bridge
They're pulling a car out from the bottom of the frozen lake

A woman drove her Saturn into the black water
Killed herself and her two kids, strapped in the backseat
She'd lost her job and didn't want her kids to be poor

The diner is noisy, black coffee and sugar, baskets of dinner rolls
Outside the crowd is growing, waiting by the draw bridge
Hoping to see the dead ones face

In the booth next to me
There are two old women eating liver and onions
And they're laughing to loud and banging the table top
But then I see that they're deaf

I don't know why they're laughing
Maybe the worlds much nicer when you can't hear the cars
They make me feel better like I'm drunk on a plane
And have forgotten I'm afraid to fly

I had a wife and children, good tires on my car
What took me from my home and put me in the earth
Was the mouth of a deep, dark hole I found behind my barn

We'd been filling it with garbage as long as you could count
Kitchen scraps and dead cows, tractors broken down
But never did I hear one thing hit the ground
And slowly I came to fear that this was a bottomless hole

I went out behind the barn and stared down in that hole
Late into the evening my mind would not let go
So I got out my ropes and a rusty claw-foot tub
And I rigged myself a chariot to ride down in that hole

My wife, she did help me, she fed me down the ropes
And then I sank away from the surface of this world
With the last rope pulled tight, I had not reached the end
And in anger I swung there, down in that dark abyss

So I got out my knife, I told my wife goodbye
I cut loose from the ropes and fell on down that hole

I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
And strange hands halted me, the looming shadows danced

Down in basements full of dust
She could not escape the static
Or the sixty-cycle hum
She wore dark-tinted spectacles 
Several fur-lined capes
Three pairs of velvet gloves
A veil of dotted swiss

But all the earth’s vibrations 
Still pounded through her ears
So she packed a steamer trunk 
And flew a prop plane to Belize

From there a log raft took her 
Over raging waterfalls
Deep within uncharted jungle 
Where giant caterpillars crawl
They spun their silk around her

I sailed deep into the hollows, deep inside the earth
I traveled a boiling river through streams of mercury

And those sweet girls lay stiff in their beds like frozen ice up on the branches

Granny Green mixed a tonic for their ills but it was such a bitter tonic
All who drank began to dance and could not stop their dancing
But none would have danced one sinful step
If that old crone had not bewitched us

How we leaped and pranced and cackled, the whole town writhing madmen
And so desperate grew some to still their feet they dove into the raging river
Still we danced on day and night till our fine clothes were torn and ragged
And crying out, “oh, Lord, make us stop” we danced naked round the chapel

How Granny laughed to see such sin
“It’s just water,” she said, “in my tonic”
But all cried out, “she lies, she surely lies” and chased her deep into the bramble
But like the four winds she disappeared
Though we searched round and round the branches
Rolling in leaves and naked ‘neath the trees we lost the way back to our village
But I swear we were all pure of heart till that old crone did bewitch us
And I know we will all go home, when the good lord returns to save us",Lizard
The Handsome Family,"The octopus has three hearts, it lives in caves below the sea
Or in a beer can or a bath tub or a puddle on the street
Any fisherman can tell you when an octopus waves its arms
It hypnotizes schools of fish, all movement stops for miles
Even the waves stand still, all the witnesses have sworn
And it’s impossible to resist the urge to jump overboard
That’s why I know I shouldn’t go on a seashore holiday
But I know that no one has to know if I take an evening stroll
Down to the end of the wooden pier where the water’s deep and cold

For if I should see an octopus lift its arms out of the sea 
Or see its shadow rising up across the rooftops above the street
I’d follow those dancing limbs to the spinning edge of the sky
Where all the boats fall off the world into the octopus’s eye 
That’s why I know I shouldn’t go on a cruise across the sea
But I know that no one has to know if I take an evening stroll
Down to the end of the wooden pier where the water’s deep and cold",Octopus
The Handsome Family,"The blue house at the corner of Twilight and State
Four storeys, soaring turrets, floors of wood parquet 
And owls, so many owls, snowy, horned and screech
Thousands of owls, all flapping their wings
How I love the marble staircase, the claw-footed tubs
The room of rare orchids, the glass hall for my guns
Statues of pharaohs, twenty feet tall, crystal chandeliers, rare paintings of clowns
But the owls, so many owls, I’m never alone
The owls make this blue house a home
How peaceful it is to watch them soar
Through the palm-tree ballroom with its gold-paneled doors
And as I sit by the fire and slip off my boots
They perch on harpoons and the stuffed heads of moose

The apothecary closet is lined with shelves
But deeper than expected and slanted as well
How long have I been here searching for my pills
As the ceiling grows upward and the walls start to swell?

Oh, the owls, the owls, with their feathers of silk
The owls they mock me and have stolen my pills

Oh the owls, the owls, with their shining green eyes
The owls will save me, if not today then tonight",Owls
The Handsome Family,"In the shadows, in the bushes, in the space between the leaves
A spider in a thicket crawled up on my knee
I put my gloves on, put my hat on, and I ran from the trees
But that little black spider came a-crawling after me
From the shadows in the bushes, in the space between the leaves
A little black spider came a-crawling home with me

It crawled across my window as I lay me down to sleep
In the morning on my pillow it waited patiently
And then came the ants, the frogs and the snakes
Slithering and sliding through my clean white sheets
Rustling from the bushes, creeping from the leaves
Every awful creature came a-crawling over me

I crushed them and killed them, but they came all the more
So I ran in my nightshirt out onto the lawn
But I tripped up on a tree root and they swarmed from the weeds
A million little teeth tore me to pieces
In the shadows of the thicket rain poured through the leaves
And I was scattered in the mud beneath the dripping trees

But from here and from there, from every direction
Little voices sang under twigs and mosses
And I swarmed and I gathered under logs and leaves
I crawled and I slithered under rotting trees
In the tangle of the bushes, underneath the wet leaves
I am many and nothing and I crawl up on your knee",Spider
The Handsome Family,"When Stephen Foster died in a flop-house on the Bowery
His worn-out wallet held just a quarter and a dime
But the crocodiles, they have to eat, the crocodiles have to eat

He smashed his head on the sink in the bitter fever of gin
A wildebeest gone crazy with thirst pulled down as he tried to drink
But deep down in the muddy stream even crocodiles dream their dreams

And as the herd galloped off he lay on that flophouse floor
Singing, “Beautiful Dreamer” as the lions began to roar
But we all have our beautiful dreams running through us like wildebeest

And when we meet at the river to cross to that gleaming shore
The river, she always takes a few as the herd thunders across
But the river has oceans to feed, she has beautiful oceans to feed

And the oceans, they feed the sky and the sky feeds the earth
And Stephen Foster’s beautiful ghost lay down to feed a song
To feed ten thousand songs echoing cross the wild plains",Wildebeest
The Handsome Family,"Lovely Mary Sweeney, the famous window smasher
Was just a quiet school marm from Lacrosse, Wisconsin
She took a pinch of cocaine but only for her nerves
Laudanum for trembling hands, a little bottle in her purse
She was a woodpecker, she couldn’t help but see
All the things that hide inside all the pretty trees

At dusk she took a train, just a hammer in her bag
She went from town to town, smashing every pane of glass
Storefronts, mirrors, windshields shattered in the night
A hammer through a window’s gleam filled the air with light
She was a woodpecker, she couldn’t help but free
All the things that hide inside all the pretty trees

In the state asylum, the windows caged in bars
They soaked her in an ice-cold bath till she was seeing stars
Wrapped up in her straitjacket her mind still hammered on
Till the glass inside her smashed and she flew off into the trees
She was a woodpecker, she couldn’t help but see
All the things that hide inside all the pretty trees",Woodpecker

The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
The Happy Organ,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

The Hard Times,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

The Hard Times,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there

No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us

it was barely december in this circle of trees
the blue through the branches the stare in your eye

your watery eyes and long puddled hair
and watched as you counted the stars in the sky

The price we pay for sheer indifference
Surrender yourself, your discount spare parts

You give up your rights
For your limitations
And abandon all hope

One step further down the line
As the flood begins to rise
You're on your knees, faking ambition
Now close your eyes and bleed

I know there are things from the past
That should never be brought back
The ghosts of stale ideals and burning bridges
In simplified inane depictions of a different world
A lie to serve the fold and the forces in them

As you give up your rights
For your limitations
And lay down your arms

One step further down the line
As the flood begins to rise
You're on your knees, faking ambition
Now close your eyes

In the darkest corner of my mind
I see a boy with a crooked smile
With a crown made of tinsel
And glass beads on a wire
Singing a song out of time

Now if you believe I'll bleed for you
And if I could bleed, well, so could you

Close your eyes and pretend it'll go away
But you know that you've got nothing to lose

She washes her perfect skin quietly

It's like we're all locked up in little cages
It's like the ceiling is closing in and the walls
It's like the walls are closing in, can't you feel that?

I will turn my eyes away
I will not turn into stone
No more accusations and lies

She's spreading herself
Flesh giving way to flesh
I watch her bones
I'm being eaten alive

Remove the eyes
Remove the eyes
Remove the intention
And kill the lights

Her love is a blinding line of fire
To where I stand
Her love is as cold as her desire
And I'll never be free

Whisperin' through the dusty aisles
Watchin' all the thinkers read
Tryin' to keep a grown mans quiet's like
Pulling teeth on a winter's eve
Cracks and pulls and unfamiliar roads
I'm on this one to find out
Veggie gas and brothers harass
Can't stay healthy in a cloud of eyes
Listenin' to my every move
Just tryin' to survive
This self-imposed adventure
That selfishness drives I can barely keep my head above the blue
Tryin' to keep it off me and you

But I can see the sunshine's rays gleaming through the clear water
Telling me you gotta hop in for this chapter's ride
There will always be better days
There will always be better days

Makin' music is what we do
Tryin' to weave the patterns for me and you
Tryin' to make the grasses breathe and a grown man cry
Truth and life is where I gleam
Tangled up in a funnel's wind
Tryin' to come out walkin'
Understand it's beyond me talkin'
Tryin' to come out walkin'

Bein' home is my vacation
Postcard dreams of a full-sized bed

Quit the band one too many times serious enough to get a rise
But he'll hop in the next mornin' for another drive
That's a promise the best advice we ever received is for you and me to stay together
It's easy to begin and hard to end
I'm just glad to go through it all with you as friends

And she knows where she's goin'
To that small corner bar
On the far side of town
Folks call her Ol' Faithful
'Cause she's always hangin' aroun'
Dressed up shimmy-shammy
In her sequins and pearls

I'm all alone

Someone to dance with me
A little romance
Cheek to cheek!
Someone to hold
And dance the night away

'Tick-tock'
Goes the barroom clock
It's quarter past two
And the night's wearing thin
She salutes the happy couples
Bids them all fond 'Adieu!'
'Barman, make mine a double!
Cinderella, here, has lost her shoe!'

But, now
She doesn't even try
Because she knows the stars

She installed a video camera over her bed in the bedroom.
No more lonely nights. In a film she once saw, a girl was
fucked by a dog. So she went to the pet store - but felt
stupid - and came home with a goldfish in a plastic bag.
The fish's name is 'SuperMan'. He would circle the bowl
world in five minutes.

She goes to bed with a lipstick and a box of chocolate.
She read in a book once that chocolate was good both
in you and on you for sexual pleasure. SuperMan
watches glossy-eyed, camera staring mute, blinking
encouragingly down at the big bed where she has fallen
asleep, fingers smeared with 'Kissing Red' and melted
chocolate - SuperMan and the remote control still in a
cramped grip.

For your birthday I'll give you scissors - shining, silver,
sharp! - to cut me open and step right in. You know I am
hot enough to keep you warm when winter comes. Oh, it
would suit you good, it would do you good. You can do

yourself a coat. Cut me open and step right in. I'm sick of

The Hidden Stars,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Yeah uhh
What it look like? Mad Skillz
Uhh Mr. Eon (The Mighty Mos Def)
The Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What? What? What? What?

It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is lookin' alright
It's high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, huh, when individual
True brand imperial you're hearin' on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos, Def init-ial
Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feelin' you; don't know what your label
Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitchi'n out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

It was a jam at the center, and the party was shakin'
And the poppers was poppin', and the breakers was breakin'
And it won't be long til everybody know that

Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of turn speakin'
'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do

Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy

Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless

Verse 1:
Death to the mic, Starbuck's on arrival
Raised in Illadel where I wrecked the recital
Introduced Jack Daniels to Mary Jane
Now they dating in my body, shit ain't the same
Your petty thinking cat need training like Amtrak
Can't stand that, need to abandon that
Catch a random violent act, over a phantom track
With zoot suits and Hammer pants, we ain't wearin' that
Swearin' that they nice, when I'm vastly, more nasty
Trashy, trying to be all cute and dashing
To alien crafts, I'm unabductible
My visionary path is unobstructible
With the dope we on, Ma look like a Pokemon
Arsenic laced lyrics that you choking on
Catch my illest tale up on story boards
Like my latest smorgasbord with 40 whores

Chorus:
High & Mighty nicest, too hot spittable
Mr. Eon's frequency's untrasmittible
Come around the way, we don't act hospitable
Can't see us, so on stage we invisible
(Repeat)

Verse 2:
Killed Billy Blanks with Tae-Bo, puffin' hydro
But guess what kids?, I wasn't even high though
A thousand thirty words can't describe my sturdy turds
Absurd, like 30 nerds doing the Dirty Bird, in Atlanta
Trash, skidded up Pampers
Looking like some old washed up exotic dancers
Trains get sprayed like high schoolers these days
They don't listen to hip hop, they checkin' Green Day
My unexpectedness is like the '69 Mets
My 69 wets on my Penthouse pets
A mic, better snatch it
Record, gotta scratch it
A loop, better catch it
The blunt, better ash it
Who want to see me erupt?
Like I had beans, tacos, pizza and Chinese for lunch
Watch me daydream about Tyra's vagina
Take a VH to it, catch me in the all nighter

Chorus

Verse 3:
I'm the illest one, I'll smoke L's for 50 years
Catch emphysema, then sue Phillie Blunts
Really stunts, no need for elaborate tactics
Just lick your lips and presto!, it's my mattress
Electrocute you in wet clothing articles
Send your air particles to the Antarcticas
With no bubble Nauticas, no fleeces
More popular in Brooklyn than Pee Wee Reese is
More infamous in L.I. than Colin Ferguson
More hated Uptown that Mayor Rudy son
I'm David Berkowitz, when I be spurtin' this
Son of Sam on this here diagram
Fuck immaculate conception, I was Anakin's dad
Took the book to Amsterdam, now the Vatican's sad
See my, boys are nuts ill ploys on cuts
Your Mattels can't swell, you be Toys'are'Us

Chorus

Where will my eighth a day habit cease?
This an agricultural service announcement
You can treat it, and you can douse it
Let us begin now with the plant
The way that it gets to your blunt in hand
See the herb doesn't grow fast enough for man
So for his lye, he makes a master plan
He has bowls to make the weed grow quicker
Through the hydroponic, the weed gets sicker
Twenty-one different soils are dumped
Into the pot in one big lump
So just before it dies, it dries
In my back closet, with no moss and flies
Off with the bud, we cut it, weigh it, and bag it
And there it is for your local street addict
Green and buddy, an ounce condensely packed
Smoke it up and catch a heart attack
Now come on now man let's be for real
You are what you smoke is the way I feel but
The weed and blunt administration'll
Have you thinkin' lye is the perfect combination
See heads be livin' under fear and stress
Wonderin' where they get the best
Now beer and bless can become a part of you
In your cells and dome, this is true
So when the plant is grown, believe it
Sell some to your man or smoke for free kid
Roll it up, and begin seasonin'
Then you sit down, and begin seein shit
In your body, Blackwoods, a Phillie, a Dutcher
All the need and fiend for another
See any smoke's addictive by any man
Even the brownish rag it's all the same
The alchemist'll have my ass, strung out
On the indo and Northern Lights no doubt
Think you got your weed habit on lock?
Tell yourself you gonna try and stop
Smokin' weed and you'll see you need the tree
It's the number one drug on the street
Not coke, cause that's a category of dope
But the green leaf, that I smoke with wreath
Now herb brings life and real bad breath
Smoke all your shit and what you got left?
Absolutely high, the sedative
Watchin' the movie Friday, with a spliff
By Chris Tucker, that high motherfucker
For anybody, Northern or Southerner
See how many blunts we gotta pump up fatter?
How many seeds gotta fall in the batter?
How many chickens want to smoke what you smoke?
And how many heads ask for just one toke?
Now they'll consume, the local dread could care less
He'll sell you donkey shit and say it's fresh
For ninety-nine, you suckers!

The High Kings,"In the merry month of June from me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted Father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand new pair of brogues, rattlin' o'er the bogs
Frightenin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, Whack fol lol le rah!

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight me spirits bright and airy
Took a drop of the pure
Keep me heart from sinking
That's the Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
An' asked if I was hired, wages I required
'Till I was nearly tired of the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, Whack fol lol le rah!

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city
Well then I took a stroll, all among the quality
Bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, Whack fol lol le rah!

From there I got away, me spirits never falling
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling
When off Holyhead wished meself was dead
Or better far instead
On the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, Whack fol lol le rah!

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul!"" says I, me shillelagh I let fly
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in
With a loud ""Hurray!"" joined in the affray
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

The High Kings,"As I roved out on a May morning
On a May morning right early
I spied my love upon the way
Oh Lord but she was early.
Her shoes were black, her stockings white
Her buckles shone like silver
She had a dark and rovin' eye
And her earrings touched her shoulders.
She sang
A lith a dlddle, lith a diddle lith a dlddle dee
Cha hiddle hundiddy, cha hiddle hundiddy
and cha lan day. (x2)
How old are you my bonny be girl
how old are my darlin
How old are you my bonny be girl
""I'll be seventeen on Sunday""

So I went to the house at the top of the hill
The moon was shining clearly
She arose to let me in
but her mother chanced to hear me.
She sang
A lith a dlddle, lith a diddle lith a dlddle dee
Cha hiddle hundiddy, cha hiddle hundiddy
and cha lan day. (x2)

She caught her by the hair of the head
And out of the room she brought her
With the root of a hazel branch
She was the well beat daughter.
Will you marry me now my soldier boy?
Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me now my soldier boy?
Can't you see I'm done forever?
I won't marry you now my bonnie be girl
I won't marry you my darlin'
For I have got a wife at home

The High Kings,"Near Banbridge town, in the County Down
One evening last July
Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so neat in her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself
To make sure I was standing there.

From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped I shook my head
And I gazed with a feeling queer
And I said, says I, to a passerby
""Who's your one with the nut-brown hair?""
He smiled at me, and with pride says he,
""She's the gem of old Ireland's crown.
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
And the star of the County Down.""

No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
That I met in the County Down.

She'd a soft brown eye and
a look so sly and a smile like the rose in June
And you held each note from her auburn throat,
as she lilted lamenting tunes
At the pattern dance you'd be in trance
as she skipped through a jig or reel
When her eyes she'd roll, as she'd lift soul
And your heart she would likely steal

At the harvest fair she'll be surely there
and I'll dress my Sunday clothes
With my hat cocked right and my shoes shon bright
for a smile from the nut-brown Rose
No horse I'll yoke, or pipe I smoke,
'til the rust in my plough turn brown
And a smiling bride by my own fireside
sits the star of the County Down

The air smelled like roses
I flew my big black balloon
As an accountant, over the city
Staring straight at the moon

Then all my friends quit smoking
Saying an ill wind had set in
None of us can win

I started drinking in city gymnasiums
Hanging out with the guys
Now all the streets are empty
No one calls I'm eating in apricots from tins

Get in the car

You could get on in this town
The drivers crawl along the curb
The thought of walking's quite absurd
The dumbest thing I've ever heard

Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

The living church must move along
The Carmelites could use a song
A blessing father if you please
Help the hopeless in their need
They don't need this kind of sleaze

Checking in and checking out
Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

Here's a man who's run the marathon
Sad and lonely, now it's been and gone
Let me check upon my family
I wonder, do they still remember me
I'm on the run, on the fun run

Gifted artists need respect
True collectors must collect
There behind those rusty gates
Dodgy sculptured license plates
The gifted sit around and wait

A flunky by his side
But there in the door
Stood his friend with two more

He captured their attention
Drawing pictures in the air
Enough for today
He shooed them away

It might as well be
Just a tea boy and me
Barely recognized his good friend
Swept through the door and down the stairs

There's not a lot to look at
Now the barn raising is through
A hundred feet high
Against a crystal clear sky

It might as well be Dumbo
With a pencil in his hand
But Dumbo can fly
That's him in the sky

Just a tea boy and me

From the architect's plans

The Highway One Ensemble,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September

The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends

Never worrying about paying or how much I owed

The Highwaymen,"I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Like desperados waitin' for a train

The Highwaymen,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman
The Highwaymen,"This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God, we could have ridden his trail

Spent his whole live saving souls

 I saw my first pistol in the general store 
 In the general store, when I was thirteen 
 Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 
 
(Willie Nelson) 
 So I asked if I could have one some day when I grew up 
 Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
 She really blew up and I didn't understand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
[Chorus (All together)] 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

 My very first pistol was a cap and ball colt 
 Shoots as fast as lightin' but it loads a mighty slow 
 Loads a mighty slow and soon I found out 
 It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 
 
(Waylon Jennings) 
 So then I went and bought myself a Colt .45 
 Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
 Never knew why, I didn't understand 
 'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 Well I got into a card game in a company town 
 Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down 
 Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
 Never touched his holster never had a chance to draw 
 The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
 Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

To lose more than he wins
Guess these trouble times get scary
But that's just ordinary

Everyone gets crazy now and then

And who can say they've never stumbled
Never fallen to their knees
Your dreams like castles when they crumble
Well, I know what you mean
And I know how hard it can seem

The Highwaymen,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while?

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!

Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail

Rolls along past houses, farms & fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Good mornin' America, how are you?
Don't you know me? I'm your native son!

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters & the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

The Highwaymen,"I was a highwayman.
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman [Live]

The snow is on the grass again,
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena,
The frost gleams where the flowers have been.

As when the summer days were nigh,
The sun can never dip so low,
Or down affections cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena,
Since last I held that hand in mine,
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena,
Though mine beat faster far than thine.
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
When up the hilly slope we climbed,
To watch the dying of the day,
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena,
More than we ever dared to tell,
And what we might have been, Lorena,
Had but our lovings prospered well.

I'll not call up their shadowy forms,
I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The hopes that could not last, Lorena,

They burn within my memory yet,
They touched some tender chords, Lorena,
Which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke,
Thy heart was always true to me:
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,

The Highwaymen,"There are shadows on the sidewalks
Of the city streets at night,
And the alleyways and ugly things
Are hidden from the light.
And somewhere, son, my baby's
Gonna sell her soul again,
For a custom tailored lady-killer
They call Sugar Man.

I searched the backstreet barrooms,
And every cheap hotel,
Asking for my baby; they all knew her well.
Well, they said, ""She's out there working
For the wages of her sin,
And if you want to find your baby, Baby,
Look for Sugar Man.""

Well, tonight I found her
On the sorry side of town
Lying cold upon the bed
Where she had laid her body down.
I picked up the needle that had fallen from her hand
And stuck it through the money she had made for Sugar Man.

There are shadows on the sidewalks
Of the city streets at night

The Highwaymen,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning 
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt. 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad, 
So I had one more for dessert. 
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt. 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day. 

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking. 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking. 
Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken. 
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost 
Somewhere, somehow along the way. 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk, 
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned. 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone. 
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down. 

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging. 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing. 
Then I headed down the street, 
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing, 
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday. 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk, 
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned. 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday

Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way--
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around--
>from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
The goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.",The Pilgrim: Chapter 33
The Highwaymen,"Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

Crowded city, there ain't nothing free
Nothing in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet Abilene

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene",Abilene
