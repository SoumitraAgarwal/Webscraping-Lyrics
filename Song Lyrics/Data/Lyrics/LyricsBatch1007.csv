Mark Owen,"Last night in my dreams I saw you with another,
And when I turned around, you were gone.
It all came back to me,
Through a postman and this letter.
That brought the words: I fell in love with another.
How does it feel when you wake up in the morning?
Do you ever think of me lying here?
'Cause when I go to sleep, you become my pillow,
And I hold you tight and whisper in your ear.

[Chorus]
Does he hold you the way I used to?  Does he smile at you from the centre of his heart?
Does he live for you, would he die for you?
If you told him that you want him to,
Could he love you the way I always will?  Well could you ask him to?

I ventured out today, I really wished I hadn't.
'Cause everything I seen and heard made me think of you.
I know I have to get over you, but at the present I'm finding it hard to do.
So I beg you please to take a moment to ask:

[Chorus]

Now I'm a speck on your horizon,
A fading light inside your eye.
I've come to understand that you were far beyond me,
But I'll never understand exactly the reason why
You never explained to me.

[Chorus]",Ask Him To
Mark Owen,"We're all the same now.
We're all the same.
We're all the same now.
We're all the same.

In this picture,
I'm going to try and get an overview.
In this picture,
The lines are blurred but my colors are shining through.
I start with a canvas,
And think about what I want to achieve.
From another angle,
The paintings gonna make a print of me.
Choose the texture.

Carot gold, the kind fit for a king.
But that ain't what I'm about,
So I'll take this earth and I'll mix it in.
Now my paintings ready to begin.
But how big should it be?
Big enough for the mantlepiece of every home,
Or small enough for my back pocket and me?

[REPEAT CHORUS]
I start with the heart now,
The rest will develop from its beat
As it takes shape.
The picture no longer resembles me;
It resembles every living thing I've ever seen or heard,
From the heart of me to a flying bird.
So, now how big should this picture be?
Should it fill the world, or my back pocket and me?
In this picture,
I'm going to try and get an overview.
In this picture,
The lines are blurred but my colors are shining through.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
Everything, everything will be okay.
It will be okay,
'Cause now I know how this picture should be.
It should fill the world, but it also should fill me,
My backpocket and me...",Backpocket and Me
Mark Owen,"Sleep peacefully now, my child.
I hope that you go away,
To a place, where your dreams can play.
Wipe all the tears from your eyes.
There is a sky of blue.
This is your time of truth.

Like a bird, high on the wind
May you fly away.
Like a snowfall in the spring,
May you cares melt away.
Child, innocent child.
Our hope lies inside
Your starry eyes,
My innocent child.

Hero, now that you are free,
You have no need to fear.
So go out and find your smile,
Like a candle in the stream.
May you float away
Like a feather on the breeze,
May you blow away.

[Chorus]
Like a candle.
Like a snowfall.
Like a feather.
Like a bird - fly away.
Like a candle
Like a snowfall
Like a feather
Like a bird - fly away.

[Chorus]

Sleep peacefully now, my child.
I hope that you go away
To a place, where you dreams can play.",Child
Mark Owen,"Early morning juices blend, he chooses
Bowl of seed, and water cleanses.
Caffeine free, with herbs for tea.
Clear and fresh, he won't be tempted.
High on see, he's staring at me.
We make us seem far apart.
Dead for a while, resurrects with a smile.
Pulls my conscience inside apart.

Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.
Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.

Second sight, no sense of fight.
He lives his life for the moment.
He stands like a god, an enlightetned god.
Ruby centers his crown.
Man of Wealth, loaded with health.
Alien, with a mother's heart.
Magic man, with your save-Earth plan.
Thanks for giving me my part.

Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.
Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.

Our body is a precious thing,
Treat it with care.
Treat it with bare.
As a snake sheds its skin,
You've got to shed your past;
Over and over.
Again, the more that you give,
The more you'll receive.
So give your love for free.
Don't live for the past, or the future.
Live now.",Green Man
Mark Owen,"Looking at me, through the eye of a needle,
Is a scary thing to do.
I feel a mole hill lies in front of me, to climb.
Is your primary purpose in life,
To scrutinize every move I make?
'cause if it is, I think your wasting precious time.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
And I know, that my job is pleasing you, but...

I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

Well I know I have my weaknessess,
As you point them out to me.
But I'll confront the spots of doubt as they arise.
Never born to be a leader,
But I'll take my role with pride.
'cause a soldier with his honours, lies inside.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
As you say, that my job revolves around you.
I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
But my life, wasn't made for you.

I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

I am what I am,
The way god made me.",I Am What I Am
Mark Owen,"Could somebody give me an answer?
A solution to fill up my space.
As I take a peep out of the hole in my window,
I see a land that is filled with disgrace.
Now is it me, or did it used to seem better?
Now a tear grows in every man's eye,
But the tear never once reached the surface.
And the tree which I climbed, slowly dies.

Is that what its all about,
Hiding our feelings away?
Let the problem be that of another man,
I'm living my life in this way.
Far away from a troubled face,
Is that what its all about?

A cure ain't been found for my problem just yet.
Behind the wrought iron gate, it is there, I bet.
But the key got a caught in a fishermans net,
With a dolphin the boy wanted, for his pet.
Well I know I ain't getting no younger;
Pretty soon, I guess, I'll be extinct.
And all that I'll leave to remember,
Is this problem I once paused to think.

Is that what its all about,
Hiding our feelings away?
Let the problem be that of another man,
I'm living my life in this way.
Far away from a troubled face,
Is that what its all about?

Put it behind you,
Turn a blind eye.
Though you always know that it's here.
Living your life through the line of defence.
I stand for myself, is that what its all about?",Is That What It's All About
Mark Owen,"Okay, so now its over.
It'll never be the same again.
The shade has changed its color.
The light is shining through you.
'Cause its over.
Its time for you to face the fact.
You've got yourself a whole new track.
The problem ain't without.
Don't hide under your pout.
'Cause its over.

You gotta move on,
Move up, and move through.
You've gotta move out,
Move up, real soon.

Nobody knows the sadness that I'm feeling today,
Nobody knows.

Who said that it was over?
Don't let your efforts go to waste.
You've done your time of graft.
Let go and you'd be daft.
It ain't over.
You've gotta come to terms with it.
Don't get left in the has-been pit.
You've still got seven lives.
The trier never dies.
It ain't over.

You gotta move on,
Move up, and move through.
You've gotta move out,
Move up, real soon.

Don't be afraid to take hold of your reins.
Don't be afraid to wipe clear your blackened slate.",Move On
Mark Owen,"Today I feel a change,
In the way you look at me.
And all I have to say,
Is that I like it.
Today I feel a change,
In your glowing, loving, chestnut eyes.
And all that I can say,
Is that I feel it.

You are everything to me,
You are everything I need.

My love,
And so much more than that.
My love,
And so much more, so much more.

Today I hear a change,
In your gentle, whispering, singing voice.
And all I have to say,
Is keep talking.
Today I felt a change,
As your hands, they touched the soul of me.
And all I have to say,
Is keep touching.

You make this world for me,
You are all that I could be.

My love,
And so much more than that.
My love,
And so much more, so much more.

I never knew
What love was all about,
Until I started looking at you.
No one ever tried to tell or show me, so I finally figured it out for myself.
That what you need,
Is someone, who without, you can't breathe.

My love,
And so much more than that.
My love,
And so much more, so much more.

How I wish, that I could be like you.
How I wish, that I could feel like you.
How I hope, that I touch you... like you.

My love,
And so much more than that.
My love,
And so much more, so much more...",My Love
Mark Owen,"Loving comes naturally.
Loving comes naturally.

As the sun rises above,
Shadows are formed
Of the two of us.
As the bird calls out its song,
See flowers dance
With the two of us.
As we bare our souls,
To the purest form,
And let our hearts run free.

Loving comes naturally.
Loving comes naturally.

As the sun hides in the shade,
Rain takes its place;
Cleanse the two of us.
Drink the falls,
Feeding the lands, flowing to sea;
Just the two of us.
As we see our world
From deep inside,
And turn our flames up high.

Loving comes naturally.
Loving comes naturally.

Playing outside as the rains coming.
Was under the shade of the tree.
Was under the shade of that apple tree,
That Eve gave her love to me.",Naturally
Mark Owen,"I listened to your album, and I watched your favorite film, 
Hey hey hey, I missed you today. 
I let those early letters I fulfilled with early dreams. Some of them 
Materialized, others never seen. 
We used to watch the world walkin' by 

The truth is you're not here, here I am. 
I'm screwed up again. 
No matter what which way I turn, how my feelings slowly 
Bleeding here for you. 
I'm spending time with hope, and I don't know why it is. 
It's just the way it is

What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 
What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 

I made your favorite dinner, and I wore the shirt you love, 
Hey hey hey, just in case you came. 
My friends still ask about you, when I say you're just fine. 
And have you seen the world walking by...

The truth is you're not here, here I am. 
I'm screwed up again. 
No matter what which way I turn, how my feelings slowly 
Bleeding here for you. 
I'm spending time with hope, and I don't know why it is.

The truth is you're not here, and I'm screwed up again. 
And I don't know the reason why, I don't know why it is. 

And will I ever say, I just need your love. 
I want you back again, I want you back again!

You said that this isn't yet a time, so give me time...to get you 
Back again.

Mark Owen,"I was into
Like a sudden fix from a bowl of sugar, to you 
And all that you were standing for, 
Yeah, you knew

I was so caught up that I could barely move, 
To stop you, 
From having everything and more 

Do you pick me up
To put me under 
Break me in
So you can choose your ways to put me back again?

[Chorus]
You can leave a hole like a nail in my head
You can leave me turned into nothing instead
You can leave me close to the edge
You won't ever hear me hit the ground 

Are you into
Have you given up, have we gone to far?
Do you wander, or are you staying where we are?
I abhor you
Yet all the while still I adore knowing you
And all that might have been before

Do I say too much, to take you over?
Break me in
So I can choose my ways to put me back again 

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm floored but not broken, 
And I'm scarred but I'll heal 
Yeah I'm blissfully tortured, naked and real 
And I'm stung and I'm sorry, 

But I'm calm now and clear 
Like the sky hanging over, 
Like the scratch on my shoulder, 
That I no longer feel, feel 

I was in too, too close to the edge, too close to the edge 

[Chorus]",Close to the Edge

Mark Owen,"Never had, I imagined,
Such a beautiful situation,
Where everything I ever wanted is here,
Is right here

She is the rock I lean on,
So good it scares me,
She's my condition,

My way back every time
When the daylight wakes me in some place

When I'm out of position
And nothing is working for me,

She brings me home,

She makes me laugh so hard I'm crying

I've never felt so animated before,
Oh no,
And when I'm losing myself,

Mark Owen,"She makes me sleep outside on the pavement,
Spends my money,
The lights are on but nobody's home,
Now ain't that funny,
She likes to tell me when she's met some other A-Z,
She's my sun, yeah the one, and then some,
She says I talk for hours about nothing,
And then about nothing,
I bought a two-week break in the sun,
She says you ain't coming,
And after all I count the seconds till she blinks again,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
Head in the clouds, she eats me whole,
A face in the crowd, my oversoul,
And I'm spinning out, I lose control,
And I don't care,
She says give up boy you're going nowhere,
So don't even go there,
Just turn the television on,
And get the housework done,
I'm only half the man I am when she's not pulling me,
She's someone, yeah my sun, and then some,
Turns her back on me when I'm naked,
Don't like looking,
Says I'm the worst thing she's ever done,
And so is my cooking,
And in the end I watch her think until she speaks again,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
Head in the clouds, she eats me whole,
A face in the crowd, my oversoul,
And I'm spinning out, I lose control,

Mark Owen,"Do you love? Yeah
Can you tell me how it feels?
Is your heart running so fast it becomes still?
Is it true you breathe in butterflies?
Is it true you blow out stars?

Do you see who you are

Some stay the same
Someone came into today
Somewhere someone passed away
And under a stone
Just skin and bone
No one wants to be alone
When all we have is all we own
What are all the voices saying?
Where are all you people going?
And if there's a God
Then why won't he talk to me?
We cry, we learn
We think about the things we're crying for
We try, we burn
And then we try and try again
When the troubles come
When we're not so strong
We need to breathe to carry on
Still looking for pieces of heaven
Cat in a box
Watching the clocks
Chase my heart around the block
Pictures of an astronaut
And all the above
Creatures in love
Making plans then getting off
Waiting for the rain to stop
Where do words go when they're spoken?
Why do some minds never open?
And if there's a God
Then why won't he talk to me?
We cry, we learn
We think about the things we're crying for
We try, we burn
And then we try and try again
When the troubles come
When we're not so strong
We need to breathe to carry on
Still looking for pieces of heaven
Sweet dreams
Go under, over
Slipstream
Above me
We cry, we learn, we walk
We try, we burn, we talk
We cry, we learn, we walk
We try and we burn
When the troubles come
When we're not so strong
And we need to breathe to carry on
Still looking for pieces of heaven

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum.

You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse.

You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top!

You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner

Mark Robinson,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Mark Robinson,"I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you

But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender

Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you

And I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

'Cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you",A Ghost of a Chance
Mark Robinson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Cigars, paisley robes
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show

All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
I can tell you what they say haters, if you want to know
They say ooooooh wee
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies want to roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
Oooooooooh weee (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way to fuckin' cold
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooooooooooh weeeee

Aiyo, aiyo
My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up""

Oh, who said, I'd lied because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied because I never

And broke my spleen, and broke my knee
And then he really lays into me
Friday night in out patients, who said I'd lied to her

Oh, who said, I'd lied because I never, I never

The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

And oh my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my God, I can't believe it

And oh my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my God, I can't believe it

The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down, I'll get right back up again
I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man

I let you build around me above me it seems profound
But much to my surprise it receives a little hit and it crumbles
I'm leaning at the core, no support, all I can do is stumble

A streak of light exposes all the glass
For stone this mountain can no longer pass
The confidence we shared has been a facade
I'm breaking out and leaving only the shards

Formidable destruction surrounding me only looks
I bust right through the glass, one attempt and that's all it took
I wanted to remain feeling safe, but it just can't sustain me
It feels more like a trap, gotta break out won't let it contain me

When I was sleeping in the night
When I was sleeping well I died
When I was sleeping in the night
Last night
And then I went to heaven
When I died, when I was sleeping
Went to heaven
Didn't like it in the night last night
And so I went to hell, I went to hell
I didn't like it when I died
When I was sleeping in the night
Last night
And then I was reborn
It was the night I died for sure
And then all I saw
Was the morning of the night
Last night
And there's no fight
The day has come
My chance was gone
I don't know these places
That you go when you are sleeping
Oh I know it might be foolish
But I hope that
You're dreaming of me

Then I went all the way to heaven
And I saw the pretty angels
Well I simply turned
And left them in
The night last night
Went right down into hell
And saw them wicked girls as well
But no I didn't feel their spell
In the night last night
Well there's nothing to be taken
And there's nothing to be given
I don't care about the living
I can't lie, I can't lie
And then I was reborn
It was the night I died for sure

And now all I saw was
The morning
Of the night last night
And there's no fight

To answer telephones
I take too long to type my name
And record messages
But my handwriting is excellent
In fact it's second to none, none

I just got in
From somewhere really good
They offered me the part of Bono
And a speaking role
With all the merchandise
And sunglasses
I could ever need, need

I drive round cities in a chariot
I get preferential treatment
At the Marriott but if the truth be told
I'm naked under all those clothes

I only want to be
In your record collection
I only want to be
In your record collection

Just to get there

And the room is strange

My teeth are bright
And my hair is clean
I wear Paco Rabanne
Like I was Charlie Sheen
But in the rain we all look wet
And in the snow we all look cold

Disgusted by all the flashness
I think I'm a don
They think I'm an actor
But I catch this
My two needs
Are pillow and a mattress
Once I can fill up the space
With a famous actress
Give me a mil, I'll do a DJ set
I pull spikey with the green
Like a cactus
Show off, ego's high
You can't match this
Chauvinistic pig
Money man tactics

I'm not as clever
As I thought I was
It got pointed out to me
As I was tying the knot
And all I want to know is
How I got so far down, down

I'm not as lucky
As I thought I was
My luck ran out the other day
As I was crossing the road
Who would have thought
A truck like that

Could have caused so much

Under a portrait of Doris Day
You and I
And a pair of C-notes
Soft candy betting hard eight

Not quite how you laid it out for me
When we split up that night, that night
Coming out of the Sunset Marquis
Before you left to deal the fine white

Is this how you pictured it
Is this how you thought it would be
We got right with the mutual problem
That got right between you and me
I told you the girl would be trouble

A lightning-fork crack in the pearl
A fault in the rock of the island
And it's usually shaped like a girl

I was the first one to see her
And you were the first one to fall
Like a half-drunken downhill skier
And she was the oncoming wall
Now I get that it's all gone awry

Call until they're coming in morning
Hit that driver if now
Life in as the breathe out easy
Drop another daffodil
Make her push up through until morning
Drop another daffodil
Say you love the man until morning

Maybe this ain't not a sin
But it's got to keep exploring
Sweep again wide eyes pressing on deny this on and
Drop another daffodil
Make her push up through until morning

Say you love the man until morning

Put another record on
Leave the shotgun on rock it
Got your body fall out

Black as the river and built to glide
Smooth as glass, smooth as Marcus Miller
Cold as ice when you climb inside

Ridin' straight and low
Stay heavy and rolling

You deal in ducats, you deal in illusion
Pay for pleasure with your pretty face
You confuse war and prostitution
In my starship I sail freely through space

Ridin' straight and low
Stay heavy and rolling

I was lost and lonely like you
Hollow-eyed and broken inside
Then I found something lasting and true

Down the side of a hill at the bottom 
Where you will lose your mind?
So many contributing factors to hide
Never will find what's hidden inside
All your friends surround you 
They're made out of air
They act like they do 
But they don't really care
That just leaves the sickness
The music in me
Take my medicine and then you'll see

The sun go down 
And so are we
I'm screaming at you 
But you don't hear me
Am I alone or am I crazy
The ghost will come around for you inevitably

Have you ever encountered a skeleton
Just a pile of bones I remove from my phone 
So how've you been
Let me sing the song that reminds me again
Of the black in your soul
It's natural
I could take these problems 
And blame them on you
I know what you did
And you know what I do
That just leaves a guitar, a pipe and a crow
You're my melody
And then you'll know

The sun go down 
And so are we
I'm screaming at you 
But you don't hear me
Am I alone or am I crazy
The ghost will come around for you inevitably

What was it like to go through a life
And end up here 
How does it feel to forget the world
And all your fears
I know it's hard to even imagine letting go
Maybe it's time you were finally crossing over

The sun go down 
And so are we
I'm screaming at you 
But you don't hear me
Am I alone or am I crazy
The ghost will come around for you inevitably",The Descent (Confessions of a Ghost)
Mark Salling,"Hey are you feeling sad today
Did you catch the one you're wanting
Just to let them get away
Everyone becomes a therapist
You can't afford to pay
You're going insane

So, maybe something's wrong with you
Seems the world becomes 
Disinterested in everything you do
And if your dream is to be lonely 
Then I guess it's coming true
Are you alive
Are you even alive
Because

[Chorus]
Love is unimpossible
I have seen her
Broken and beautiful
Rising up above my remaining ashes
Kneel
Higher power

Now, nothing's left to do but wait
With no distraction from yourself 
It's time to re-evaluate
You should make your peace with God
Or maybe focus on career
But one thing is for certain
There is nothing for you here

So go
There's so many things to see
Just beyond the song of darkness 
That is permeating me
Just because I'm a prisoner don't mean
That you're not free
When we met you were blind
Now I'm praying that you see
That

[Chorus: x4]",Higher Power
Mark Schultz,"I'm down on my knees again tonight
I'm hoping this prayer will turn out right
See there's a boy that needs your help
I've done all that I can do myself

His mother is tired
I'm sure You can understand
Each night as he sleeps
She goes in and holds his hand
And she tries not to cry
As the tears fill her eyes

Can You hear me?
Am I getting through tonight?
Can You see him?
Can You make him feel alright?
If You can hear me
Let me take his place somehow
You see he's not just anyone
He's My Son.

Sometimes late at night
I watch him sleep
I dream of the boy he'd like to be
I try to be strong and see him through
But God who he needs right now is You.

Let him grow old
Live life without this fear
What would I be
Living without him here
He's so tired and he's so scared
Let me know that you're there

Can You hear me?
Can You see him?
He's My Son.",He's My Son
Mark Schultz,"You've got a secret no one knows
Locked away where no one goes
Deep inside your heart,
It's tearin' you apart.
You hide the pain in all you do,
Still the shackles binding you are heavier than stone,
But you are not alone.

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you.
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you.
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know:

I am the answer,
And I am the way.
I am the promise,
And I have called your name.

So you want a brand new start
Askin' Me into your heart,
Down on bended knee
For the world to see.
And the chains around your heart
Fall away and break apart
Suddenly you see
The truth has set you free.

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know:

I am the answer,
And I am the way.
I am the promise, and
I have called your name.

Surrounded by darkness
You stumbled along
Knowing the road that you traveled was long
But I'm here beside you,
Yes here all along,
The one that will carry you on.

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you.
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you.
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know.

I am the answer,
And I am the way,
I am the promise and
I have called.

Oh when you are down
You think no one's around,
But I'll be with you both night and day.
I know the good times,
I'll see you through bad times,
Oh you know that I'm here to stay.

I am the answer,
And I am the way
I am the promise,
And I have called your name.

Mark Schultz,"You gotta nice job in an office on the seventh floor

Find the one that rolled away the stone

Pack your bag and leave it all behind 
What are we waiting for?

The pain you keep inside
It's slowly tearing you apart

I believe that you've seen the hands of God
I believe that you'll know it when
You're back in His arms again

I believe that He never let you go
I believe that He's wanting you to know
I believe that He'll lead you 'til
you're back in His arms again

Something in your eyes shows hope

Mark Schultz,"In a room without a view, a new mother smiles and holds
The tiny fingers of her brand new baby girl.
Her husband takes her by the hand, so unsure about the future
Have no money can they make it in this world?
And they pray, Lord all we have to give is love
Then they heard a gentle voice like an echo from above,

I have been there. I know what fear is all about. 
Yes, I have been there and I'm standing with you now.
I have been there
And I came to build the bridge oh so this road could lead you home.
Oh I have been there.

He's been a pastor twenty years
But tonight he sits alone and broken hearted in the corner of the church
He tried to change a fallen world
With his words and with his wisdom but it seems like it is only getting worse
And he cries, Oh Lord I just don't understand
Then he felt the hand of grace, and he heard a voice that said

I have been there, I know what pain is all about
Yes I have been there, and I'm standing with you now
I have been there, and I came to build a bridge
Oh so this road could lead you home
Oh I have been there.

An older man up on a hill
Holding flowers but he can't hold back the tears.
Oh he has come to say goodbye.
He thinks about the life she lived,
Thinks about how hard it's been to live without her
Sixty years right by his side
And he cries, oh Lord I loved her till the end
And he heard a gentle voice say you'll see her once again

I have been there
I know what sorrow's all about
Yes I have been there and I'm standing with you now
I have been there, and I came to build a bridge
Oh so this road could lead her home, the road could lead her home
Oh I have been there, You know I overcame the cross, yes I have been there

Mark Schultz,"Words and Music by Mark Schultz
From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #1.

You stand on the edge
You followed the call
No turning back you are risking it all
He whispers your name
In a moment of truth
The rocks fall around you
The ground starts to move
You step out on faith
It's all that you know
You jump into darkness and hold onto hope

When the mountains fall
When the rivers rise
Security crumbles before your eyes
The one thing you know
In faith you'll find
Something to stand on or you will be taught to fly

So dream your dreams
And live your life
Knowing there's more than to merely survive
Don't give up, don't give in
Fight through the rain and lean into the wind
'Til you come to the edge of all that you know
Run right through the dark knowing you're not alone

When you walk through the fire
It will not consume you
Though the water will rise
It won't overtake you
Though the mountains will fall
Oh, still I am with you
I've called you by name
And I will not leave you
I'm learning to trust you
I'm learning to fly
I'm learning to trust you
I'm learning to fly

Mark Schultz,"She walked to the mailbox
On that bright summer's day
Found a letter from her son
In a war far away

He spoke of the weather
And good friends that he'd made
Said I've been thinkin' bout dad
And the life that he had
That's why I'm here today

And the at the end he said
You are what I'm fighting for
It was the first of his
Letters from war

She started writing you're good
And you're brave
What a father that
You'll be someday
Make it home
Make it safe

She wrote every night as she prayed

Late in December 
A day she'll not forget
Oh her tears stained the paper
With every word that she read

It said,I was up on a hill
I was out there alone
When the shots all rang out
And bombs were exploding
And that's when I saw him
He came back for me
And though he was captured 
A man set me free

And that man was your son
He asked me to write to you
I told him I would
Oh I swore
It was the last of the letters from war

And she prayed he was living
She kept on believing
And wrote every night just so say

You are good 
And you're brave 
What a father that you'll be someday
Make it home 
Make it safe

Still she kept writing each day

And then two years later
Autumn leaves all around
A car pulled in the driveway
And she fell to the ground

And out stepped a Captain
Where her boy used to stand
He said mom I'm following orders
From all of your letters
And I've come home again

He ran into hold her
He dropped all his bags 
On the floor
Holding all of her letters from war

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

Holding all of her letters from war",Letters from War

There's a smiling face with

Please close your eyes and bow your heads

Could an ocean even hold the tears you cried

Like playing baseball in the yard with dad at night

So if you worry if your choice was right
You gave me up but you gave everything to me

And if I saw you on the street
Would you know that it was me
And would your eyes be blue or green like mine
Would we share a warm embrace
Would you know me in your heart
Or would you smile and let me walk on by
Knowing you had dreams for me
You wanted the best for me
And I hope that you'd be proud of who I am

You gave life to me
A chance to find my dreams
And a chance to fall in love
You should have seen her shining face
On our wedding day
Oh is this the dream you had in mind
When you gave me up
You gave everything to me

And when I see you there
Watching from heaven's gates
Into your arms
I'm gonna run
And when you look in my eyes
You can see my whole life
See who I was
And who I've become

When all our tears are washed away with a break in the clouds
His glory coming down and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, every one will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

For anybody who has ever lost a loved one
And you feel like you had to let go too soon
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But don't you know it's just a matter of time till the tears are gonna end
You'll see them once again and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, every one will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

Oh, and on that day we will stand amazed
At our Savior, God and King
Just to see the face of amazing grace
As our hearts rise up and sing

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross
Singing glory, glory, hallelujah
Christ has paid the cost

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross
Singing glory, glory
Christ has paid the cost

And every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, every one will see

Love has come for us all
Love has come for us all

And every knee shall bow, every tongue confess

Mark Schultz,"Starlight shines, the night is still
Shepherds watch from a hill
I close my eyes, see the night
When love was born

Perfect child gently waits
A mother bends to kiss God's face
I close my eyes, see the night
When love was born

Angels fill the midnight sky, they sing
Hallelujah, He is Christ, our King

Emmanuel, Prince of peace
Loves come down for you and me
Heaven's gift, the holy spark
To let the way inside our hearts

Mark Schwaber,"We could sit here all day, counting breaths we take so low and waste away the day.
Or we could take a drive and fuck the law in front of you and talk until intent is true.
Let's laugh last again.
We could think ourselves to sleep. Counting sheep and all our fears until there's nothing left to hear.
Your talk turns tides and then it screams ""bounce off the walls"" it's riinging clear...",Bounce

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

She'll blind you if you stare too long
Go on believe what you wanna believe

She's bad for business, quicksilver
You're gonna love it but it might kill ya
So long - you're gone

I wasn't strong enough to take her on

Slip away if you try to hold on

Mark Seymour,"Yo
I gotta story, about money, women, and power
and who truly has it

Her name, seems to slip my mind
but her face is stuck in my brain
Can vaguely remember the day we met, see it had rained
the road over, on Soppovada was wet
And my car wasn't, huggin the terrain
So there I came into her lane
I was to blame but stopped my headlight in the front
'cause I ran into her back
But she didn't, over-react, 'cause her cruiser wasn't even scratched
In fact, now that I think, back, I was gettin macked
by a tender, oh yeah now I remember
Vanessa from Maryland, aggressive and tanned
It was December, of '94 and she was finding O attractive
Lookin like an actress, skilled in the art of macktress
She asked if I was cool, I said ""Sure
but damn I fell like manure because baby I ain't insured""
Her reply - ""Poor baby, don't worry, I understand
but man makes the money, money never makes the man
She said

	[Hook x2]
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	And that's real, and that's real

We started chillin, it was all the way live
She flipped me a downtown highrise in 1995
8-50i, no more sess highs, strictly chronic and thai
Rolled in place in a gold cigarette case
Liquorice papers for sweeter taste, my pockets was laced
with big head Benjamins, crushed in cinnamon, linen and black Gators
Platinum, chains, rings and bracelets
Found out she was a mule for the Mob
Had plans to rob, and wanted me in on the job
Bust this, disgusted, one night in the middle of sex
She asked O-Press - ""Are you down for this?""
And I said ""YES! Baby yes!"", ugh
I must confess it was a bit risky this way
But when she hugged and kissed me, uhh, I didn't care
Got to the point I didn't even wear underwear
'cause she would want it everywhere and anywhere
(Man makes the money, money never makes the money)

	[Hook w/ variations x2]
The matriarch was established, we was after the cabbage
To continue livin lavish she had a plan - hit her ex-man
for three hundred grand, I just put him to sleep
and keep it movin to a spot where, we used to creep
Agreed, greed, bubbled up inside me indeed
So on Friday when he received loot, I walked in and proceeded to shoot
nigga's in they knees, fuck 'freeze', yeah yeah
there's the money, oh shit and seventeen keys
Stashed up and shit, shot to the designated spot
at the designated time, she was late I had to wait
Escalated my mind to stop the shakes
I had just shot niggas up, like a scene out of Carlito's Way
She walked in around ten
I was in the corner with my 9 sayin ""I thought eight was the time
we had agreed upon"" but I noticed she was nervous
I said ""What's goin on?"", that's when she blurted
""??? heard about the Mob, how we did it, the money - give it
Trust me baby, I'll be back in a minute""
Then she kissed me on my face, grabbed me up under my waist
and left, I sat for three hours and still not a trace
Soft nigga, I got the seventeen, I'ma just dip
That's when the cops showed up, talkin bout an anonymous tip
They got the dirty cookers and the pure uncooked
Took me and my attorneys hell just to get me one L
With no possibilities of parole I was lost
Vanessa made me made loot and made off
Uh, what?
I said Vanessa made me, made loot and made off

	[Hook to fade]
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man

They trickle down your cheek, tears fall like seed on barren ground
Your thoughts are scattered like paper everywhere

Like a moth to the naked flame, you just can't keep away
You twist the truth and you turn the other cheek

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Mark Soskin,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

It's the only children's song that we've ever encountered 
That contains all three of the basic elements of every single children's song. 
The first element is simplicity, so that the child can understand the song. 
The second element is pathos, to prepare the child for later traumatic experiences.

Mark Whitfield,"Spring in Manhattan starts after dark
After a lazy afternoon in Central Park

Washington Square may be where
You'll feel her warm touch
Down in the village you'll find
She may be much, too much

Spring in Manhattan never stays long
Still if you fall in love she'll bless you with a song

And if you'll listen to every word
The song she'll sing
Will bring spring in Manhattan
To stay all winter long

",Spring in Manhattan
Mark Whitfield,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn
Mark Whitfield,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Mark Whitfield,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break

Back when all we had was love and dreams

Raised at the fork in the road in a clapboard house
And Rachael was a land baron's daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Her daddy said he wouldn't stand
For Rachael to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines in a young girl's heart

So late one night by the harvest moon
Jacob climbed a ladder up to Rachael's room
He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for a brown-eyed girl
And gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'Cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder

It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found a ladder and a note on her windowsill
He swore he'd never forgive them
But nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will
Now she climbs up on his knee
Says, ""Grandpa, tell a story, the one about me""
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says, ""Listen Child, once upon a time""

And a yard like a puttin' green
But she likes to feel her toes in the mud
Wearin' her cut-off jeans
She says right beside me
Is where she wants to stay

Just look where she is today

Five days a week in the same bus seat
For a girl she was pretty cool
She wore an old ball cap, hated lace
Played a mean shortstop and second base
Never missed a day of Sunday school
And I never told a soul back then
But Emily Harper was my best friend

We carved our names on an old oak limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim
A farmer's son and a preacher's only daughter
We ran barefoot through the garden gate
All afternoon we'd laugh and play
'Til the sun went down on me
And Emily Harper

About the time I turned sixteen
I noticed Emily's eyes were green
And how they shined when I made her laugh
I liked it when her hair was down
I hated other guys around
I played it cool but I had it bad
Lord, her Daddy had a fit
When he caught me stealing my first kiss

We carved a heart on that old oak limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim

How you opened my life to a new paradise

In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart, until my dying day

Taking control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine

The world is empty and cold at times
But here in your arms I am warm inside
Beyond any feeling I've felt or believed
Bring on tomorrow I can face anything

I watched her walk into the night
The hardest thing I ever did was let her go
We swore as friends we'd stay in touch
Best of friends don't mean that much
When that phone call comes to tell you
She's in love

She's in love
She's got that fire in her eyes
She's in love
How her smile lights up the sky
It's like she's walking on air
She's been set free
Still I can't believe
She's in love
Strolling down a one way street
Looking like every man's fantasy
She's in love
Why can't it be me

Told everyone I'm doing fine
Learned to get on with my life
I just want what's best for her
So I lied
Found a note on my door last night
Said, I'll be your friend until I die
But you should know I found someone
Now she's in love

She's got that fire in her eyes
She's in love
How her smile lights up the sky

She said, ""You're gonna be late if you don't go""
He held her tight, said, ""I'll be alright
I'll call you tonight to let you know""
He bought a postcard, on the front it just said Heaven
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, ""Hello, I miss you so, wish you were here""

She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ma'am the plane went down

No survivors found she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail

Said he loves and they told her

I thought he was just being a kid
When we got back to my place
And he did what he did
On a balloon that he won
He wrote mama I had fun
I missed you and I wished you were there
I wasn't sure what he had in mind
'Till he jumped up and ran outside and

He let it go, he waved goodbye, or was it hello?
I don't know but I died inside
I can still see his excitement
Him pointing and smilin'
When it was gone as it could get
He turned and asked me
You think it's in Heaven yet?

Well I struggled for something to say
I was too choked up and
Lackin' the kind of faith he had in his heart
Before I could start
He walked me back inside
He gave me his Crayola pen
Said, I bet there's a message that you'd like to send
And no doubt he was right it's been locked
Up inside since Grandpa said goodbye
I took that yellow balloon and I wrote
'Til I ran out of room then

I let it go and we waved goodbye
That seven year old
Lord he opened my eyes
I can still see his excitement
Him pointing and smilin'
When it was gone as it could get
I turned and asked him
You think it's in Heaven yet?",The Balloon Song

I hate Chicago

Sara told me that she only
Needed space to think things out
Then she met some guy named Tony
Guess where they live now

I hear the food is great, I hear the summer sure is nice
It's beautiful at Christmas, there's three more reasons why
I hate Chicago
From their WGN station to their seven feet of snow
The rock band in the 80's to the Oprah Winfrey Show

Sara told me that she only
Needed space to think things out

How one day we would settle down
Find ourselves an old farmhouse
On the outskirts of a small town

Bet your mama sure is proud
Finally found you a real straight lacer
All your dreams getting buttoned down
Baby you know that I know you too well
Before you cut the cake, before you ring that bell

I'll be around, around about the time
You're wishin' for a Friday night with a ragtop down
I'll be around, around like a second hand tickin'
In the nick of time, let me make you mine
When you long to feel the wind in your hair
When your choices seem a little too square
I'll be around

Girl you never did like vanilla
You were more of the rocky road kind
You hated princes and Cinderellas
Gravitated to Bonnies and Clydes
I'll wish you happiness
But, baby if you find that the shoe don't fit

I'll be around, around about the time
You're wishin' for a Friday night with a ragtop down

Mark Wills,"In my Heaven there ain't no lawyers
Don't need names on dotted lines
Folks do business like they oughta
A good firm handshake works just fine
We feed lawyers to the lions

Totin' loaded guns to school
Ain't no such think as peer pressure
Being who you are is cool
We still teach that golden rule

No lyring, crying, or dying young
No one's lonely, no one's scared
And everyone is welcome there
In my Heaven

In my Heaven I can sing like Elvis
Play guitar like B.B. King
Slide a fastball past Hank Aaron
Hey now batter, batter swing
I can do most anything

In my Heaven we hurt no one
No lyring, crying, or dying young
No one's lonely, no one's scared
And everyone is welcome there

What my Heaven's gonna be
I ain't tellin' him his business
But if he left it up to me
Then in my Heaven
There's football with no referees
Then in my Heaven

And in my Heaven
The fish will bite most anything

When I disappear, how did I lose this piece of time

When she brings his eggs and fills his cup

I've been there before
Keep on looking 'cause
Maybe who you're looking for is...

Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there
There's somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl
From two floors up
Maybe she's the one
Maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there
There's somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why
He searched so long
When she was always there
At that diner waiting on

I'm thankful to be living in
This childhood dream come true
But sometimes the attention
Just leaves me confused
Yeah, I love my t-shirt on those kids
My name there up in lights
But when the show is done and I'm on the bus
Riding through the night

I think of New York City and
Those firemen and cops
Who ran in and laid down their lives
Because it was their job
A soldier in a field of mines
With each step he lays it on the line
When you look for heroes know that I'm just
A singer in a band

I'm humble when you take the time
To hear my life and verse and rhyme
But when you look for heroes know that I'm just
A singer in a band

Shadows of a few more years on her face
That ain't the girl that I knew yesterday
Oh no, now, that's a woman

Up and running at the crack of dawn
There ain't always time to get her make up on
But she's more beautiful without it on
Oh yeah, that's a woman

She's got a grace that I don't understand
She can move mountains with those tender hands
She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah that's me, lucky me

Ohh.. ohh.. oh.. oh.. yeah..

She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah that's me

And I can see she's getting sleepy now
Still she finds some time for me somehow

Mark Wills,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house,
That don't bother me,
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out,
But I'm not afraid to cry,
Every once in a while,
Even though going on with you still upsets me,
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm ok,
But that's not what gets me,

What hurts the most,
Was being so close,
And having so much to say,
And watching you walk away,
And never knowing what could have been,
And not seeing that loving you,
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you
Everywhere I go,
But I'm doin' it,
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone,
Still harder,
Getting up getting dressed never want this regret
But I know if I could do it over,
I would treat every way all the words that I say in my heart that I left unspoken,

'Cause what hurts the most,
Was being so close,
And having so much to say,
And watching you walk away,
And never knowing what could have been,
And not seeing that loving you,
Is what I was trying to do

Mark Wills,"Thirty-one and six foot even she still looks at me and sees
Her wide eyed boy, six years old reachin' for her hand to hold
She still tells me, ""Wipe your feet son, wash your hands, it's time to eat""
She believes she's heaven-sent to protect my long lost innocence

What she sees in me is nothing but the best
In her eyes I'll never be anything less
It's a love strong enough to forgive the rest
If only I could always be what she sees in me

This ain't the paradise I promised her it's just a slice of life
With an average man honest work with calloused hands
And it bothers me I can't deliver all the things I swore I'd give her
But she looks into my eyes like life with me is some kind of prize

What she sees in me is nothing but the best
In her eyes I'll never be anything less
It's a love strong enough to forgive the rest
If only I could always be what she sees in me

Three years old and two foot four each day when I walk through the door
She runs to me and holds me tight and in her eyes there shines a light
That reaches to the deepest part of all that's good inside my heart
The places that are kind and true and I know I must live up to

What she sees in me is nothing but the best
In her eyes I'll never be anything less
It's a love strong enough to forgive the rest
If only I could always be what she sees in me

In the spotlight for a while
But in the things that really matter

‘Cause I've seen a third grade angel
With dark circles ‘neath her eyes
Not a trace of hair left on her head

Mark Wills,"I sat down on that bar stool with a heavy heart and teary eyed
And that smoke filled neon light I took a drink
And spilled all my troubles on that beer stained bar
I cursed the night, yeah I let her fly I guess God was listening

I found myself in the company of familiar strangers just like me

There was no tall white steeple or a big stained glass cathedral
Just ordinary people sharing life and telling jokes
Trying to find a little hope

I found a little amazing grace in the most unusual place
Somewhere between the bar stools and pool tables
I was entertaining angels

A little southern comfort, I listened close and bought a round
As Tommy talked about losing his wife
And Joe just shared the bad news, he's got a little time but it ain't good
And it made me take a good look at my life

'Cause all my problems seem so small, I'd like some kind of miracle

There was no tall white steeple or a big stained glass cathedral
Just ordinary people sharing life and telling jokes
Trying to find a little hope

I found a little amazing grace in the most unusual place
Somewhere between the bar stools and pool tables
I was entertaining angels

You never know when you could be in the present of a heavenly

Mark Wills,"He almost forgot how to drive over here
By he tries to survive over there
Some young conscious ripped him off
And running him over the road

He just turned 22 last week
In the back of a strike 
He never thought he will live this old
It’s crazy being home

He stepped off a plane
Feels like yesterday
They were waving flags and signs with his names
They said they will pray for what he done

He only knew what he became
The girl in love just wanted to wait
But he came home to a cold empty place
Got a burger today and got a new cell phone

It’s crazy being home
The stars don’t loo the same
He still answers to his name
It’s okay something it just ain’t right

He tried to fight for what he love
But these young eyes have seen too much
Till you will be where he has been
You wouldn’t understand

I hope you will never have to my friend
He got to call us back on a plane
To where he belong might sound the same
His brothers are there he can’t find this alone

So they dropped them right there in the blood red sand
His best friends is locked and in his hands
And the sergeant yells it was time to go
And he thought it’s crazy being home

A shadow appears on center stage
And sings a haunting melody
While a distant fiddle plays
Look closer
And you can almost see a rhinestone
Shinning in the dark
He's still a living legend
Living right here in my heart

He's the phantom of the Opry
A grand old spirit from the Ryman days
He just feels at home here
He don't really mean to haunt this place
Every time it rains in Nashville
They say the angels cry
Cause the phantom of the Opry
Never got to say goodbye

Some say it's Hanker or Lefty
Or that Kentucky Bluebird flying back again
No one knows for certain
We all know it's more than just the wind
There's a ghostly sound of steel guitar
Cryin' in the night
Doesn't come from center stage
Often somewhere on the other side

He's the phantom of the Opry
A grand old spirit from the Ryman days
He just feels at home here
He don't really mean to haunt this place

So baby, maybe we should just turn out the light

I'd rather not hear, then to have to hear you say
But baby, you're not sure, or even love me anymore
I'd rather be wrong, about that look in your eyes
I'd rather not know, you're about to say goodbye
I can't pretend that I don't see
While you're lying here with me
There's somewhere else you'd rather be

I thought I made you happy, so why can't you look at me, anymore

I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Mark Yasuda,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had",Africa
Mark Zauss,"While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame that a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy, he treats it so well",My Heart Belongs to Daddy
Markette,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing

Markette,"Lately I'm skipping along the street
And I ask myself why
I'm walking in rhythm to a new beat
Must be the look in your eye

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop
Ooh ooh yeah yeah

This is unusual
It's not like me
To be acting this way
I'm talking in riddles and poetry
No one understands what I say

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop

I don't know why I gotta boogie
Could it be your standing by me
Everything I see so shiny now

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop
Ooh ooh yeah yeah",Get Down
