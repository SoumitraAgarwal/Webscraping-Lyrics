Dizzy Gillespie,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Dizzy Gillespie,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Ballad Medley
Dizzy Gillespie,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Sometimes I'm Happy
Dizzy Gillespie,"Everybody look at me, 
Happy girlie, you will see, 
I've got someone nice, oh, gee! 
Oh, joy, what bliss! 

Just the treasure that I need, 
Pure as gold and guaranteed, 
Is he handsome? Yes, indeed! 
Let me tell you this: 

I found a new baby, 
A sweet honey boy, 
My fashion-plate baby 
Has thrilled me with joy! 

His new way of lovin' 
Has made me his slave, 
His sweet turtle dovin' 
Is all that I crave! 

Sweetest kiss, what a kiss, full of bliss, can't resist, somehow! 
Tells me lies, but he's wise, naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow and how! 

I don't mean maybe, 
I just had to fall, 
I found a new baby, 
A new baby, that's all! 

I found a new baby, 
A sweet honey boy,

Dizzy Gillespie,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do

Dizzy Gillespie,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Dizzy Gillespie,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day",I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart
Dizzy Gillespie,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town, hm
 
It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town
Dizzy Gillespie,"I have heard all you've been saying
Yet I will love in my own way

Lonely as a desert breeze
I may wonder where I please
Yet I keep on longing
Just to rest a while

Where a sweetheart's tender eyes
Take the place of sand and skies
All the World forgotten
In one Woman's smile

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally
The one my worshiping soul possesses

At her call, I'd give my all
All my life and all my love enduring
This would be a magic World to me
If she were mine alone

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally
The one my worshiping soul possesses",One Alone
Dizzy Gillespie,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Dizzy Gillespie,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through With Love
Dizzy Gillespie,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Dizzy Gillespie,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Dizzy Gillespie,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Dizzy Gillespie,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time On My Hands
Dizzy Gillespie,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?
Dizzy Gillespie,"You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You don't and I'm left alone.

Sing the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me",Mean to Me
Dizzy Gillespie,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
",My Reverie
Dizzy Gillespie,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca
Dizzy Gillespie,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Dizzy Gillespie,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Dizzy Gillespie,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Why should ev'rybody pity me,
Nighttime's falling, folks are a singin',

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.

Are drifting through my opened mind

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,

Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Dizzy Gillespie,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Ballad Medley: On the Alamo/Stompin' at the Savoy/This Time the ...
Dizzy Gillespie,"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Dizzy Gillespie,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby

It's my man

And no hero out of books

I'll go away, When I know

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:

Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,

And after all's said and done, there's only one,

Sunshine and joy always nigh;

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous guy

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy",Jealousy

With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame

Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eyes, and chapeaux by Dache

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Dizzy Gillespie,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

Dizzy Gillespie,"On a picnic morning without a warning
I looked at you and somehow I knew
On a day for singing,
My heart went winging
A picnic grove was our rendezvous
You and I in the sunshine
We strolled the fields amd farms
At the last light of evening,
I held you in my arms
So when days grow stormy
And lonely for me
I just recall picnic time and you.",Theme From Picnic
Dizzy Gillespie,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunnyside of the Street

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

All the lovely things you are to me

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

Together we're going a long, long way

Dizzy Wright,"She said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
You about to grab your full clip so you can go retaliate
You wanna know why I'm trippin?
'Cause I don't wanna have to birth this baby on my own 
And have to explain why you passed away
You say, you good, like you may be home
But in my heart I know you may be wrong
I wish you understood I wouldn't agreed to a baby 
If you was gonna be beefing with other hoods, you trynna play me out
A negative is how you make me out but if something happened 
To you which one of your homies gonna help me raise this child?
We was in this together, be a man
And if they killed yo friend I know damn well they'll kill again
So don't you look at me stupid like everything's alright, 
It's not alright your stupidity can cost you your life
And now I'm stuck with your child, understand me
You worried about your goons and I'm worried about this family

Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
The fact that they used a full clip to kill my fucking best friend
So why you talkin about family? I considered him family, 
So don't mistake this for a muthafucking Def Jam
I'm trynna tell you I'm good, but if they take me home
I pray to God that you keep my baby strong
I may be wrong trynna handle with altercation
But how can I live my life if I ran from this situation?
So I take a little vacation after my nigga got blasted
I was riding when he was riding
Now I'm supposed to be scared of a casket you ain't feelin' that?
I ain't no killa but I'm killing back
I don't give a fuck!
I'mma retaliate like I can bring my nigga back
It's war, it's not my kindness it's insanity
Take a friend of mine and now everybody's an enemy
Fuck it I gotta do it, don't lose it I know you hate this shit

Might not meet your standards, but I swear to God I try
Use the Lord in vain to get my point across, why?
Hate it, but I do it, like it'll be aight

Fuck going to jail, I got bills to pay
My everyday life make me feel this way

Tried to keep smiling, but the smiles be shady

Rewarded for the good, man, we trained like dogs

I wanna see the dollars circulate
Bout to elevate

Tell me I'm loved, tell me you proud of me
'Cause shits changed
It's taking a whole lot outta me
My daddy don't love me
Or maybe he do, but he ain't around
I hope you know I ain't just laying around, shit
I got off my ass and I chose to get it in
I turned my homies into buisness men
So I just gotta sin
Put on the city of sin with my friends
Now me and all of my niggas pitchin' in
I hope you understand, this ain't a sob story
I did this by myself
No one did the job for me
I took a different route
Right road into discussion
Took a minute to bubble
Now we on the finishing touches
Now I'm all in public
And I love it
Not cause I'm buzzin'
In God we trust
I'm asking God can you guide me love
So much to believe, too much to retrieve
I just hope I get it out before I leave

Man I gotta be remembered
Man I gotta be remembered
Yeah cause when it's all said and done
And they take me off this earth
I just hope you realize what I was worth
Putin in words
So I can be remembered

It's cool cause my momma's a little more involved
When she gives me problems I just smoke it off
She said she loves my message so she's quick to show me off
I know enough but I don't know it all
I listen it all my big hommies
To get advice as a man
I grew up trifling but tried to advance
Even when I was six
I got a pick with a mic in my hand
I'm proud of myself I like where I am
See I just want to be heard
Respected and comfortable
Even when I'm away say daddy still lovin you
Typical tho, you into your toys I'm into my flows
But baby girl it takes a minute to blow
So I swallow my product
Spit the truth and now they follow my ride
I make visuals for my visions
And now they follow my rhymes
Thank God for my blessings
I grew up unprotected
Not neglected, stressed a little, seen a talent and perfect it
So when you let them know about me
Let them know I gotta be remembered

Yeah cause when it's all said and done
And they take me off this earth
I just hope you realize what I was worth
Putin in words
So I can be remembered

Ain't no shame in the way I act
It's a way of life
You way out the facts
You livin a lie, we live and we die
Who gives a fuck
They only judging cause we live it up
And barely gettin by
But I still keep a smile on my face
I learned how to set my negatives to the side
And just smile thru the day
Some times it gets overwhelming
Coming down off my high
Getting depressed with all this shit I dealt with
I feel selfish but let me make that shit a little clearer
I ain't rude I just need to work on the man in the mirror
Starting from where I lack
Back to were I was at
So I can see the growth
You can even hear it in my raps
Potential green
May half of these niggas disintegrate
You limit yourself you've been a fake
Me, I've been around
You know me from my beginner stage
And now I'm in this bitch to leave you in a maze

I'mma probably hit your city and rep Vegas all in that bitch
Look, ladies all on my dick
Throw that pussy just so I notice them, backstage and I'm on my shit
Them hoes seen the dough and they broke it in
I got bad shit on my mind, but I'm looking like I'm supposed to win
I did bad shit in my time, now I'm dealing with it as an older kid
I spit real shit for the real niggas, truth is they can't take this shit
These niggas try to take my soul, them niggas better know how to take a clip
I got guns all in my closet, attention all in these chapters
God all on my side, you can hear the shed of my laughter
With these little niggas that'll ride for me
Big homies that's guiding me
But God can't protect everything see this four-five on the side of me
See it's 2012 and my mind fucked, fucked around and got mind-fucked
Rewind back smoke some tree and realize where y'all 'bout to wind up
Took the time now understand it's an understatement to under plan
Front ya man I say fuck a deal I got the skills I need a hundred grand
I'm starting my own shit boy, putting all of my niggas on, we in the zone
We traveling I got the whole world tryna sing along
Swagging out for y'all little niggas
Just to get to y'all little niggas
I pray to God that you pray to God
Stay in your lane and we good nigga

You fascinated by my progress
Boy I been on my P's and Q's
Believe in me you believe the truth
Momma ain't raised no ho nigga
But the streets had to show me how to speak the truth
Still walking that Wright Road, I soul searched and I found me
Lost some niggas, gained some niggas
But I'm proud of the niggas that surround me
Proud of the niggas that found me
Funk Volume all in ya face!
Flintstone better get gone, all about my chips 'cause I'm Vegas raised
See I got a little hate in my heart like I play in the dark
Kinda crazy but I'm playing it smart
Can't stunt so I came to talk, the sound of pissing an angel off
Ain't it hard, living the life, by the end of the night you'll be all alone
Came with niggas but them ain't the niggas that
Was with you when you first walked through that door

I better be satisfied with the moments
Better start thinking bout my future

Can I turn my dreams into reality
And beat the odds of just being another rap nigga
Black young man father to a young queen
Bless the birth of peacing me
So when I leave the streets
Think fully
I hope you see me in the eyes of my angels
Dear Lord, then I thank you
You do so much but shit
Look at me smile, wow
Chill my nigga It's for the people that was putting me down
I'm as good as they come and I know that
I've struggled enough and then I go back
Down to my lowest
My nigga we focused
The moment is ours and we bout to expose it
I've been reading a lot but ain't showed it
Expanding my mind, just taking my time
Reading the signs and in between lines
My kind kinda ? come by
Man I'm on the right road, but my vision getting so blurry
I'm speeding on these highways cause my best just don't seem worth it
She be slay them when she working
Feet hurting
From all of that standing
Abandoned, still standing
Overcoming the shit that she was handed, damn
Still damaged and she recognize it
She the one in the class that's extra quiet
The one you can't read
Who live and believe in these new ways that she been exercising

Living life right now as the good child
I've put in work discovered real
Stuck and fucked in a fucked up deal
Lucked up still, got up out of this shit
Slappin' pussies with the side of my dick
I've been on my grind, for my child
Made me proud to be part of a blessing
Rizzo locked up, baby mama knocked up
Now he dealing with another nigga connection
Man I'm stressing, man I'm smokin'
Looking at life from a different perspective
Man I'm growing, these niggas' is hating
And now I walk around and I stay protected
I ain't thugging, I ain't sold a brick
I ain't on stage tryna hold my dick
I'm outta town I got a show to give
I'm from where the broke niggas had to show me shit

They predict for all of my niggas we'd be dead on drugs or in the pen

I keep faith, even when I fight myself
Bring me down and get beside myself
The hardest critic is the niggas that's spittin'
All of these lyrics lil nigga tryna find himself, shit,
Time will tell I might as well
I got a soul I ain't tryna sell
I came from the bottom, tired of all the problems
Looking for a way 'cause I spent a little time in hell, goddamn!
Lost soul with a wrong crowd, bad mix with a bad bitch
Distracted by all of the good, settle for the hood
We gon' see how fucking far these dub sack get
Still move

Killing rappers, you all practice guys

You want a one hit wonder or an artist that got more than one?
You need to make up your mind
'Cause I'm constantly taking my time
You fucking with me, then you leavin' that fake shit behind

Found the weed before we went exploring it
This talent is what I was born with
Took about twenty years before I was touring it
Do you like it? Cause it's the first time you done heard it
Just wait 'til you see me performing it
I'm so live on the stage cause I smoke and I rage
And I jump on the crowd like I'm Method Man
So I'm puffin and rapping my verse on they hands
So high I hope that I never land

Grab some weed, grab my engineer, hit the studio
And tell that nigga that we staying for weeks
My album on the way nigga get ready
I feel like the rap game waiting on me
Hustle hard as I run the distance
Praying for my little brother with a son that listen
My mind lives on more than one dimension
It's a problem not a issue, you gon' learn the difference
Whatever my nigga I'm solid
I'm kicking back kicking my knowledge
We bounce like hydraulics (Bounce bounce bounce)
Give it to them while they novice
So they can accept and allow it
Everybody want to be on
Couldn't find another me with a drone
You can try all you want, fly in the sky all you want
Taking blunts to the dome
Paying four double O for an ounce with the bro
Making sure the family tree stay strong
'Cause when them branches stop falling
These niggas start renting it and talking and acting like hoes
Don't act like these hoes
I ain't afraid of no man
That's not how I'm programmed
Can I get more grams?

Kindness is a gift
Kinda can smell success, I'm just, I'm just trying to get a whiff
You could say that I'm glad that I had me a childhood (Why's that?)
'Cause now I'm living out my dreams
Nowadays kids not even living they life, they just staring in they iPhone screens
By any means necessary
Rhyming all that's left in you
Better love the ones next to you
I see a lot of young niggas looking for a sex symbol
Technology is taking over
Feed off these real vibes as you make it older
Young soldier, we all gotta grow
And when you think that you got life figured all out, you realize how much you don't know
Look, after Moms threw me out on the curb
Back when the vibes was louder than words
Yo, I told myself I was gon' get it and god is my witness
My focus was how to be heard
Now I'm here, I see the smiles and tears
I hope this live for a thousand years (It will)

'Cause we characterize (We characterize)

Is it wrong that I feel this way?
Can I feel this way?

Like Martin when they tried to black out the black folks and white America mistreated us

It's only one race and that's the human race
So that's what I plan to teach my kids
Respond to these fools with silence
As I'm giving y'all the growing process
You can tell me what's next
I ain't heard nothing like it
(How you gon' remember me?)
From living in positive energy without ever having a doubt?
Or praying for my enemies, [?] by the hate
'Cause I ain't never take the easy way out
S'till I pray
Can I feel this way, Lord tell me can I feel this way

Got me working at my craft every day

W-w-w-wake up, get right, look in the mirror and I hope you see yourself
I honestly don't want you to be like me
I wanna, inspire you to go and be yourself

There's some things in life, that won't be right and won't add up
But don't try to be what they like, we all have bad days and bad luck
But don't forget you can call on your old man, don't forget you can call on your old man
I'm here whenever you need me, through hard times everything's gonna be all fine
'Cause you got me and I got you, (You always got my love)
But loving yourself against the universe is what I wanna give to you
Everything I did for me I built for you (I built for you)

Don't worry 'bout the moves I make, we can really take it there if we have to
All I hear is ladi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dada

They calling me the fly guy general, everything is memorable
Marijuana keep me at my pinnacle
Look, lucky me, I got two nougies that's identical
Me stayin' away from all the nicotine and chemicals
Look, I hit my west coast 1-2, cause lyrics do what guns do
Niggas doing what they want to, like this is what it's come to?
Come and witness lives you see me saving
DDT, you break your neck before I break my concentration
Mention the best, motherfuckers better come correct (right!)
Respected on the West, no doubt I'm here to finesse (right!)
Got problems? Hit me direct or get hit with the kill switch
And see, Dizzy go 0 to 100 real quick

Look, Z to the third, I prefer to observe
Been on the sideline for a minute, now I'm 'bout to emerge
Separated myself from losers tryna take what I earn
Put my faith in this music knowing nothing's easy deserved, I got racks baby
You haven't noticed, I've been working on these tracks lately
Stacking this ammo just in case these niggas act crazy
I got my eyes wide open, putting this plan in motion, plotting how when I'm smoking
Forget about it, your vision's clouded and the truth is shrouded
And bullshit, so, all that gossip, we can do without it
I'm SwizZzleFish, who wants to skinny dip and take a swim?

His head inside a duffel bag that's in back of my Dodge
Mr. Benton, ho, I refuse to be pigeon, ho, with these imbeciles
A space ace that's been on, bitch, I been gone
I finger these hoes till I get carpal tunnel syndrome
I rap like I don't wanna go back in that basement
Cook up murder material, get blood on my apron
You don't want no problems, what the brass knuckle done
I'm a bully, I don't care to watch these fags guzzle cum
Gat with the bracket that the strap buckle on
Dr. Lecter in this bitch with that black muzzle on
Fuck the industry! Chip on my shoulder, bitch, remember me?
I'm 'bout to murder all my enemies, Hail Mary!

Sorry if I come off conceited
I'm dropping killer bars till you niggas all deleted
This lil' microphone, I'm known to eat it

It was hard to keep the bitches off my penis
Can you believe it?
I been perceived this, a motherfucking omen

I ain't here to take no shit from no man
Got a problem with you, I'mma say it, bitch, you know it

Look, if you don't know nothing about how to love, brother
You don't know nothing at all
Thinking like what if fifty years ago
They had what we got?
These cell phones or the Internet
Would have been divided by color
You all can't even prepare us for this shit we dealing with now
So the newer niggas gotta be able to help their younger brothers
And love each other
'Cause the people still talking
The soul of Doctor King is still marching
We dealing with these everyday tragedies

Dizzy Wright,"Yo, it's taking a lot for me to give y'all all of me
For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
S'till, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends s'till exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances 'till you're fouling out
And I'm like, let me live without taking no breaths
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man 'cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes
You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
'cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just like to trust (Trust)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
'cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banging
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it, I did it

From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope 'cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, ""Did you sell dope when you fell broke?""
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell vote?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, ya pale rope
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne
No more saying, I can't afford this
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
'cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes list
So God bless America",God Bless America
Dizzy Wright,"Hip Hop music, I’m a part of it James Brown probably would’ve thought of this
If it don’t make you feel good why you applauding it
From Vegas tryna get to the point where I’m Marley Marl-ing it
Take me back to the days in the past
My older brother’s getting in trouble, I was saving his ass
Headed to gym class
Baby almost made me late
I’m tryna squeeze in them thighs
She tried make me wait
Can’t front like the early 2000’s wasn’t the days
When Allen Iverson made everybody wanna wear braids
Young and reckless
And I’m stuck in my ways
I’m 24 and all I wanna do is smoke and get laid
I’m talking no fucks given
You notice the ones who talk and gossip the most, you have no trust in ‘em
1990 J’s with the skinny’s tucked in 'em
Retro soul with the henny cup with him
Oh, yeah that’s me with the two-step
In the party, in my own world, not givin a fuck who left
Dancing the night away
With a soul with a smile that gon’ make a brighter day (oh yeah!)
Now I’m feeding off the positive vibes
I’m not gonna lie
When everybody think they know me, they gon' have to assume
(So what we doing)
Twisting doobies in the back of the room
And where I’m at for what I’m actually doing
So let me ask y'all

I don’t know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes (hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes

(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yea)

Yo in ten years your raps not gon' matter
Unless I’m left field or Dizzy Wright right after
Living a life that you niggas obsessed with
Telling my story, this is just another chapter
What you make of a young man working faithfully
Real is something that these niggas can’t take from me
Call it what you want, but I know what it is
But you better watch what you say to me
Play no games ‘specially if you not family
I wanna live in a country that’s pot friendly
One love and positive vibrations
Blessed with a mind that take me to wild places
Give that to y'all
Let y'all run with it
Come get it, if you’re down feed off that
Not involved with a lot of things that take me off track
But if you love it then I need your back
Talk to 'em

I don’t know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes (hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yea)

I don’t know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes (hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes

Dizzy Wright,"Higher learning, higher learning, higher learning

I heard they praised me for being real, but I don’t see the support
Fell in love with changing lives and chose that over a sport
Could’ve been anything in life and yet I’m out here on tour
Like some day we gonna get bored and we gon' want more
Pretty much prepping myself
For the fans that finna get ahead of they self
When they act like they know everything about me
And all the niggas that doubt me
Come outta nowhere and start criticizing all proudly
Like “hold on nigga, where the fuck was ya’ll at?”
Buggin out on me, nigga fuckin' now, homie
Some days I can feel Hopsin’s energy rubbin’ off on me
Cause the love don’t feel real if the talent is only a skill
It’s unrealistic to think that one day we won’t make a mistake
But who am I to say, it’s probably from never taking a break
Finding pleasure in poetry, guitar strings and a bass
Uh, my life ain’t been the same while on the run
When these kids say “fuck a message, we just wanna have fun”
Now I move to the beat that confused me for weeks
While ya’ll hands high, my head high like hold on nigga you lost me
Then I looked at my Youtube views, and I got salty
Cause I realised my real shit don’t get that much love
I see exactly how ya’ll do ya’ll favourite rappers
Favorite musicians, athletes, actress, actors
Spreading anything without it being the truth
I guess to tarnish someones image these days is the thing to do
But when you stop judging the music
And you decide you wanna judge me on the way I live my life
Cause I’m a celebrity and you can
Don’t be surprised if my response to the negative shit
Is telling you to “suck my dick”
I’m a grown ass man
Grew up strong enough to deal with all these so called fans
My momma say I got thick skin
My daddy say they’ll never really understand our struggle as kids
Until the end, build off small wins, now here I am

Let me knock this sound check out

When it comes to all around artistry (right, right, right)

I ain't breaking no laws (nah)
Keep it cool everybody know me (everybody know me)

The radio don't play me and, I don't even care
My core fan base made, me a millionaire (true)

In a town car thinking, daydreaming
But its really true (it is)
All this cash that I'm counting

Two green houses and a water fountain (Scarface)
Three girlfriends, they all hate each other (come on now)
Can't we all, get along, and hang together? (trust me)

We still verbalizing it's a damn shame I ain't bigger now
But look i made enough to at least to help all my niggas out
Every month we get weed provided
Smoking that Dizzy OG and I'm getting excited
Makes me want to spread love, nigga why the fuck is ya'll fighting?
Why the fuck is ya'll complaining about who the nicest?
Now everybody coming to my shows and wanna smoke and hold up their devices
Look, ya'll should just enjoy the vibe
Close your eyes and just enjoy the vibe
They say there's more to life than weed
I tell them I'm more than fine
Low temp dabs, no blowing, puffing on no hookah sticks
Hitting up Logic like ""hit up my celly when you feeling buried alive""
(Puff puff then pass)
When you make up your mind hit my line
'Cause these other niggas be lying, they shit trash
We new and improved, puffin a doob, chilling with uncle Bern
With some sexy girls

I told the homies i ain't coming out empty handed (Not at all)
They ain't believe me I was [?]
Going in one ear and out the other
You should've seen what I was planning
Making music videos with the cannon
Didn't know nothing, did everything low budget
But we had real love for it (Love for it)
And that was where it started
Man life is crazy and I hate the way I saw it
So i did it, little nigglet was legally blind
Build up my confidence
Do anything I set on my mind
'Cause I was taught you won't get nowhere with a negative mind
They show love and I respond man the pleasure is mine
On one, one day God's response gon' come
You really wanna be able to look back
And thank yourself for not fucking your future up in the long run

No struggle, no strength
With two jobs I'm tryna juggle my shifts
I'm looking around (Round)
And i can see these frustrated looks, being mistreated
Feeling like they got the chain on they foot
Spreading awareness
Without being careless it gets deep
But some of us just got that shit you can't teach
But that can't be cloned (Cloned)
Would you have acted a little different if you known
She was already being abused at home
Screaming who am I
A humble king until I'm crucified
But I'm not here to try and make it about me
Do or die now watching another friend commit suicide
'Cause even at her bravest she was feeling afraid to leave
I mean long walks and good talks and therapy
May not never be enough but shit its a start to a better me
And I'm not tryna tell you how to live your life
But when I needed to hear God's voice this is what he said to me

At first we lost, but oh man we searched
And only god knows that it ain't been perfect
But we moving in perfect time, and it's ticking it's ticking, the watch is still ticking
On the race against the clock it's my mission
Built for the heat, stay in the kitchen
And I never play victim, I just, cook it up so it's easy to digest
Invest cause I'm one of the wisest

And Bone dropped E. 1999

Yo, I can tell they wasn't gon' be laughing at me later
Now the same niggas is asking me for favors
When I heard this beat I start feeling like Jigga man on ""Imaginary Players""
Thinking to myself like, ""these new niggas can't rap like this""
Four grams off the scale straight into my maintainer
If you ain't saying shit then fuck them headbangers and I'm screaming it out
Making music for you to lap dance
I wouldn't be surprised if my future killer's a black man
Wake up, walk out, another man chalked out
I feel like everyday I see the world a little different when it start out
CNN showing the wrong niggas going all out
Can't have a black event without black people having a fallout
Shout out to all my leaders that take on risks
Educated brothers against these niggas that make no sense
I see you in a [?], dog, you can bank on this
Here to keep it real, not to play no tricks, ya punk bitch! 

So just ride to it, can you vibe to it?
To see the good in everything you gotta train your mind
Don't let this motherfucking world waste your time
Holla at me if you change your mind, I want to world to just
Ride to it, we getting high to it
To see the good in everything, you gotta train your mind
You gotta train your mind, holla at me if you change your mind
I want the world to just

Concentrate, rolling something up with organic vibes
Blending in, walking through these streets like I'm camouflaged
I'm dealing with this third eye shit
I see who they wanna be with three eyes
I got two to look and one to see
Better watch out boy
I been had it now I'm right back to it
Got an old soul, with this stoner body attached to it
Happy that I'm alive, wake up with a smile on my face
Getting a back massage, baby already rolled up an eighth
Now I'm in this routine, she know what I like
Cherish the simplest things
But she don't wanna be in another situation-ship
Been so invested in being the best don't know what to make of it
But she see the good in my dreams and why I been chasing them
I had no love for them so why would I wait for them?
I see these kids in Vegas, I'm tryna be great for them
I'm talking the real life academy
No, I'm not here to brag about my salary
I'm here to try shape your mentality

Focused on variety
I'm not the new 2Pac cause I'm here to do this quietly
But I'm here to shape society
Couldn't even envision what I'm tryna be
I'm next level with it
Thank you Funk Volume for signing me to come get it
Now I'm in it, spreading positivity and empowerment
Doing this way before Kendrick
Was rapping about lacking confidence
Feeling like all this new rap music just ruins it
So I'm here to let go of my outer inner-fluences, I'm cooling it
Giving all you niggas something real to follow
Even though the truth is a hard pill to swallow
It's still the motto
Painting these pictures like the real Picasso
If you don't fit in today there's still tomorrow
Hoping it benefits us both

You listening to a young father who don't got it all figured out
My feeling was killing my spirit it's time for me to get out this house
And go make something of myself maybe one day I'll make ya'll proud
But I mean for now I'm in these streets running around with my dick in my hand
Couldn't even stick to the plan cause I'm gettin distracted again
Now I got a baby on the way even though that wasn't in the plan
But I need some unconditional love to help me become a better man

Anyways I'm focused
Smokin like fuck yo catchy hook and a slogan
It ain't no middle ground
To Vegas if I ain't a legend then I'm the closest
And I just wanna be real with yall
Maybe share my creative ideas with yall and build with yall
But yall just gon downplay the boy like you don't hear it
Can't be cautious creative thinkers must be fearless
That's some good advice but when you presented yo big idea how they gon feel it
I say we go make my million dollars look like 10 million

But I just wanna sleep in a cali king and have safe sex on it
Travel the world doin what I love so I can get a paycheck for it
Put my city on and I got respect for it when [?] then I'm less for it
When you need someone to believe in I'm the best for it
Better check for it, attack everyday like its my last
Thinking for so long write it in short for your simple minded Ass
Lighting the joint like fuck all my problems waiting for time to pass
We got it now but will it last

Will it last
We got it now
We can't go back
Will it last
We got it now
Can't go back
Can't go back

Constantly reminding myself that we all look at things differently
Built this so yall can feel this as I spread this positive energy
Realistically what's important
Cuz half of the time half of these niggas don't even know what they're supporting
If you want the life then I'm warning ya
These fans could say that they love you and turn into babies without they're formula
Crying to get attention homie yo expectations hella low
What happened to being yourself yall see me and act like yall met a ghost
How you gon handle the lifestyle knowing damn well you ain't got no self control

One of my Brodie bros conversing with my trying to put me on game
Still I remain with the world on my shoulders but yall not feelin my pain
These rappers work a lifetime for a hit and still be livin the same
So I'm doing everything in my power to make this last
I made mistakes in the past but today I hope my branches grow
The more money I receive the more the more my people gon learn what I'm standing for
Focus on how my brand should grow they demanding more
Haters hate but they standards low
I'm just trying to balance out what I'm rappin about

Too much at a time the next you know they tappin out
I was spazzing out, homie said put down them blacks and smoke this half an ounce
And before you bounce make sure they fuck with your meaning
You too understandable these rappers can't fuck with your English
Started thinking maybe I should spaz less switched up my address
Coming in peace I'm here to inform educate and provide some access
Will it last until my last breath, maybe past death
If you hear my voice just know that I'm never gon half step, but ask yourself

Mama working for a temp agency, man any day she could be unemployed
It's a war zone out here
My family can't afford no health care
Got daddy issues at home, so I'm damn sure I ain't finding no help there
So I'm in the streets, Satan like to save his place for me
But everyday we're waking up and pray the police don't do us like Freddie Grey
I heard there's niggas dying everyday
I don't think they got the homies losing sleep
My community lacking unity
Who gonna help us with these opportunities?
Look, barely even learned loyalty
Cause the streets will eat you up and spit you out
Getting older, got to help with bill or mama probably finally kick me out

Don't be selling weed before them school dongs come sniff you out

Have a 40 with your niggas
And look around
Cause in a couple years everybody won't be in the picture
Why you rolling up winners?
I'm losing my mind
Cause a woman of the year was Caitlyn Jenner
That's disrespectful, I'm offended
A man is a man, even after the image
Wait, you can't tell me this world ain't confusing!
Drugs got niggas dealing with it, do you niggas even pay attention?
What are you rap niggas doing?
That ain't cool
The struggle remind me of the starving days
Most people fail by only focusing on the starting phase
Too bad they don't teach us that in school
Cash advances, no overdraw fees to damage with the funding
You could start a business, but can you run it?
Don't waste your life chasing money

Tell them this the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more

With the brodee-bros telling them I gotta be the best out
This more then getting rich but the real shit made them have a melt down
Fuck any nigga saying we ain't headed down
Down running through this bitches doggin finna settle down
Lord knows i need this life tattoos my inspiration that's graffiti life
I'm living the speedy life doing a hundred and twenty while They try and catch me this is a daily ritual
Only nigga headed to the top taking Vegas with him
I'm just trying to be authentic these days
Saving money bitches getting awfully friendly these days
Run it back for the motherfucking [?] replay

Cause ever since I was a kid I had a dream could be the fucking greatest dog
Call me crazy now they are me going crazy hard
You can never kill my spirit when I'm taking charge
Taken off I don't go to sleep till I'm in the clouds

My real homies with me telling me to stick with to the plan My vision blurry but fuck it I'm not going to it discourage me

Dizzy Wright,"Yo, you know when the timing is perfect
Pull up a connected dots and be conscious with every purchase
I'm, fully in service you seen it coming this engine running
Feel like I'm getting younger, but I'm no Benjamin Button
Tossing and turning I know I'm not laying here for nothing
Shucking my thoughts like concussion, rushing, bottom buzzing hope you hear me
Reminiscing on the days when my pockets was empty
Twenty years and I bet they could see my father in me I'm
Painting his picture, learning his life that was given 
For the ones that wasn't with him we still learning the system man
They don't give a damn, be a failure like your father
Life is fucked up, why you trynna make it harder?
Let me be! How far you thinking ahead?
Well it depends how much I'm making and how much I'm gon' spend
Preach! Nah don't preach, don't speak, don't repeat
Loving yourself is the only relief
No dealing with negative people, grab your phone and delete
Tone it down, make a point, then they hit you with the run around
So what dumb it lower take it lower than the underground
Niggas see me, they just need to hear me when I come around
I still feel like I ain't shown my full potential yet
Let the instrumental play so I can let my mental flex
Motivated, bad passes getting intercepted see me getting started
Working harder, I ain't finished yet

While I got 'em watchin'
They got me out my comfort zone and I've been plotting
They got me out my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep 'em watchin'

While I got 'em watchin'

They got me out my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep 'em watchin'

In 20 years you can tell my son his dad was a hippie
Spirit like Bob Marley, that's why we named you after Ziggy
While the whole world getting trippy
I was different, definitely psychedelic like Jimmy
Noble Bookitty's my queen, a Cookie for really yo
Empire numbers so we travel from the winter to the Sydney Australian summers
I'm truly blessed for the silent moments, I need 'em
Haters always get ignored, silent treatment's how we treat 'em
And I don't wanna waste no energy no more
On another niggas flaws
I mind my business and let karma do it's job
My personality will never let me be no fraud
Telling myself y'all couldn't handle all of my deepest thoughts
Hypnotizing light it, man it's satisfying
Get your highest while you thinking let your fingers write it
How excited, life's your journey better be your pilot
Niggas flying over water when they landing get indicted
Fuck what these people think, they be on it
Life's passing better enjoy it, your passionate moments
Sadly the new deepest text is mackin', fakin' and hoein'
Small talking in the open, and overheard how you growing, keep my thoughts in an envelope
Before I put 'em in the post
Seen the most and we be too focused on the instant emotion
Can't complain, I'm learning from it
Negativity and we ain't gaining nothing from it so my mind is up to something, feel like I

Dizzy Wright,"Wisdom's better than silver and gold
So you better take these good vibes with you and go hit that road
[?] the hardest things in the world to do was let go
But if you knew then what you know now
You probably would've taken things slow
I know
You are the universe
You deserve the universe
I know, I know
You are the universe
Yes, you deserve the universe
Don't let 'em change your mind
You are the universe
You deserve the universe
Go let the whole world know

Dizzy Wright,"Yo, I'm a quick learner
Trap it up, don't let the bitch burn ya
If you smokey, don't be playing with me
On Fridays I be big worming
On Sundays I think I'm Richard Sherman
Block the pass and then I make the earnings
Bounce your head and that's for every person
From the hood up to the damn suburbans
I'm getting fly bitch, close the curtains
Me, you and this Hennessy got me Lil Durkin'
Tryna make it perfect, is it working?
Making money got me waking early
I don't even gotta throttle my hand, I continue to grow while y'all walk around me
That's just motivation, send a notification like
""Bitch what the fuck is you talking 'bout me?""
I'm the man, little baddie getting slammed
Bumping Jarren for the jams
Take a dab and then I dab
Then I go HAM with the band, nigga you ain't got a chance
Vegas the land, I'm a candidate
Groupies on tour sucking a dick for a laminate
Dizzy OG for the cannabis
Tear up the spot, promoters can deal with the damages
I'll be damned if I'mma do it
I'm a father and a student, I see what you niggas polluting
I'm twenty-fivin' throwing deuces
You better watching who you shooting
Man, this weed done woke me up
Only time I smoke sativa you niggas in luck
We still can't trust 'em and we still going up
And we still moving to the grave
Spread your legs like the J's
Dizzy Hippy is the wave, unlimited flow
Making more than what I'm missing
I should play for Golden State
I'm Kobe Bryant number eight
Put the city on my back, 702 where it's at
I'm legendary, that's a fact
But I ain't satisfied until I sell out the Thomas Mack
Yo, it's non-negotiable
Couple niggas hating on me, don't be emotional
Y'all was sleeping, it was noticeable
Now me and the greats going toe to toe
Causing trouble, fuck a motto
Where the focus is, results will follow come tomorrow
Heard that hope would get a nigga killed
So every day we go a lil' harder

Work a lil a harder
Go a lil a harder, work a lil harder
Work a lil harder, go a lil harder
Go a lil harder, work a lil harder
Work a lil harder

Yo, this is more than tryna swipe the card or swipe the bar
Fuck a psychic
I'm associated with a psycho, so I'mma psychiatrist that's tryna do it all
There's two kind of people in the world
When you fall, you lay there or play it off
In 20-16 I'm taking off
Make it count, I mean to take 'em out
Black and proud, a nigga standing outside of Raven's house
Like ""Damn, home girl - you done made it out""
""There ain't no need to be slaving now""
Anyways, I designed a journey
I should be the vice president right beside to Bernie
Having conversations with my attorney
So all that fuck shit don't concern me
Malcolm X with the pen
Only thing different I went and put it on my skin
A lot of knowledge, [?] a lot of gems
Dizzy Wright, there's not a lot of him
Niggas gotta recognize and they will
I'm a couple years in the making
So I wake and bake waiting for the scrambled eggs and the bacon being patient
Bitch I'm getting married, I ain't dating
Got some stoner bitches, no relation
Bitch you tryna get saved
I'm Ty Dolla $ign with the saving
I told her ""A lot of niggas wanna switch me places""
Just in case I'm always staying dedicated
Discipline over desperation
Yiggity Yamp! with the exclamations
A couple mil is what I'm estimating
Do it for my son and my daughter
Everything I taught them everyday it only make me wanna go a lil' harder
Working 

Harder
Go a lil a harder, work a lil harder
Work a lil harder, go a lil harder
Go a lil harder, work a lil harder
Work a lil harder",Work a Lil Harder

Même si tu t’appelles Cindy et que tes yeux bleus scintillent
Et que tes proches, parents ne cessent d’te dire que t’es gentille
J’suis victime d’un coup de pute comme le père à Simba
C’est pour ça que j’évite de fréquenter les mecs que je sens pas
Dites la vérité maintenant je suis plus un gosse j’ai grandi
Dites à ma niece qu’on mourra tous comme la mère à Bambi

Still thuggin', still leanin' to the back, you can bet that

Seven-tre, seven-five dope ridin'
And we ain't trippin' on nothin', just vibin'
Big nine with me 'cause a fuckin' nigga tried me
They already know how I let him go
Kill his ass and make sho' at his funeral
How the hell a O.B. gon' try me?
I'm O.G. on and off TV, see
Middle fingers in the air, tell 'em fuck y'all
Tryin' to hate on my dawgs, hell, fuck, nah
Why you hatin' on a nigga like that?
Why you tryin' to stab a nigga in his back?
I know some niggaz don't like this
But them niggaz is the reason I'm like this
Fuck, niggaz done made me mad
I'm 'bout to snap 'n' put this K on his ass

I'm clickin' over, lemme tell her I got another call
Ridin' wit' my trunk popped up like I'm ""Above the Law""
Tires wet and, nigga, they still drippin' Armor-All
Tell me you gon' fall, and I ain't got to use the arm at all
Bet Daddy finna trick 'em, finna flip the paper
Chamillinator, me and Trick - we finna shred a hater
Tip the dinner waiter, trick 'em like we finna date her
Get off ya sleeves, let 'em breathe like a ventilator
Hey, what can I say me and the king Of M.I.A
Finna, (hey) finna touch ya niggaz and ya finna pay
Stay wit' it; hey, you, we ain't finna play
Snatch ya off the wheels, and you can watch ya rims spin away

And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again

And I just can't figure out why

Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us

But you and I know
It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it

This is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

I wish that you could hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away

It's not a jack for his scratch or his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
and left him with two black guys
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch lookin they gon' put him to rest

My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rock smelling the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!",Come Clean

Looking out my window 
Looking at the rain 
Nothing left but pain 
Why'd you go and leave me 
Sad alone and blue 
Looking out my window woman 
Tryin' to find you 
Why did you leave me? 
Why did you grieve me? 
Looking out my window 
What do I see? 
Nobody's crying 
Half as bad as me 
I don't think that they feel 
So alone and blue 
Looking out my window baby 
Trying to find you 
Why did you leave me? 
Why did you grieve me? 
I'd like to tell you about 
This little girl that left 
Me so alone and blue 
The trouble is if I paint the 
Picture too well you 
Might fall in love with her too 
She was about 5-6 
A little bag of tricks 
My mama told me to watch myself but I didn't listen 
Because for you baby I'd scratch out my eye 
Looking out my window 
Down the railroad track 
Waiting for that little brown eyed girl 
She's coming back 
I gotta hear that whistle blowing 
Down the line 
Come back girl 
She'll be mine, oh mine 
Why did you leave me? 
Why did you grieve me? 
Whoa 
Baby come on home 
I'm so alone 
Ya know I don't care what the world might say 
I'm gonna love you 
Oh baby 
I'm down on my knees 
And I'm beggin' you please

There's no denying
If you dare to be true

In my dreams I dreamt for two
My dreams were real but where were you
And now my dreams have all been changed
Rearranged there's room for two
But not for you

You don't even move me
There's no denying

DJ Andy Smith,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic",The Wizard

Top your dreaming and your idle wishing
You're outside and there ain't no admission

Pack up your ambition in your old kit bag
Soon you be happy with a packet of fags

You're there and there you are
Everything is in it's place
Authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are
Let them feel that they're important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that they're contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight
If he dies we'll send a medal to his wife

Every single kiss felt like burning flames
Our love was wild like a hurricane
We used to run away and be gone for days
Hiding from the world in our secret place
We made a promise we would never change

That we would never grow old
We are the light, we are made of stars
We are the love in our beating hears
And we'll never, ever
We will never, ever
No we will never grow old
We are divine, we are beautiful
We are the life indestructible
We will never, ever
We will never, ever
We will never grow old

Remember swimming naked in the lake
Too much was not enough, took what we could take
We watched the world sleep as we stayed awake
We said we gonna run 'til the end of time
And we would write our names on the skyline
We never fade, we will always shine
And we will never grow old

We would never grow old
