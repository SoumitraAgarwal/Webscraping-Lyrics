Dottie Dodgion,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Dottie Dodgion,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way
Dottie Dodgion,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Dottie Dodgion,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Dottie Dodgion,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill
Dottie Peoples,"I know there's pain
Why do lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

You could sustain
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness
You got yourself into your own mess
Lettin' your worries pass you by
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free the chains
Yeah I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day yeah
If you hold on

Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day,
If you hold on
Can you hold on
Hold on baby
Won't you tell me now
Hold on for one more day 'Cause
It's gonna go your way

Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can't you change it this time

King Darius, made a decree 
there won't be no praying around here, 
whosoever call on any God's name 
will be cast into the lion's den 
Daniel didn't pay the king no attention 
Three times a day he prayed to God anyway 
When confronted with the consequences of the lion's den 
I can hear old Daniel say 

All night, Daniel stayed in the lion's den 
In the morning, to the king's surprise 
God sent his Angels, to shut the lion's jaw 
And Daniel was still alive 
Daniel used the lions for a mattress and a pillow 
And the Angels rocked Daniel to sleep 
When he got up, Daniel let, everybody know 
I'm not ashamed of the God I serve.

Dottie Rambo,"Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise
For it was grace that brought me liberty
I do not know just why He ever came to love me so

To view the cross where Jesus died for me
How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul

Dottie West,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys with empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world so gay and bright
But I can't say I love you dear to a street of city lights

Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears

I never knew that I could hurt this way

Dottie West,"Last night all alone in a barroom met a man who set my heart awhirl
He had a smile on his lips and coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any girl
Then he came and sat down at my table and as he placed his warm hand in mine
I found myself wanting to hold him for temptation was flowin' like wine
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and he whispered I need you come with me let me be your man
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on

And I'll stand by you if you'll ever call
And if I should ever hear that she made you shed a tear

I want to be in the warm hold of your lovin' mind
Feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing that'd make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
Standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be

But I saw you last night you held my hand
So tight as you stopped to say hello
You wished me well you couldn't tell that I'd been

Crying over you, crying over you
Then you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling what can I do

And I watched our little boy outside at play
With the little girl next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops came my eyes would lame
'Cause I heard him name the game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little boy say to her

I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done

There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun

You might be turning yet

There are so many times that people
Have to love and then forget

Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

The note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a-runnin' 'round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be bringing up your little girl this way""
It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

And was playing soft

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done

Dottie West,"Here's a song for every woman
Who's ever waited for her man to come home
And for every man who's longed to be there

There's a storm across the valley, the clouds're rolling in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whining of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from ridin'
On your prayers up in the skies
Ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning supper's on the stove
But the light in your eyes that makes him warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him how you spent your time
And what's the latest things the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt your baby moved just yesterday

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again

And all the time that I can lay this tired old body down
And feel your fingers feather soft on me
The kisses that I live for the love that won't go away
The happiness that live in with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of just spendin' time with you
It's the livin' thing that make a house a home
Like a fire so softly burning the supper's on the stove
And the light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again

Until she cracked my head when she asked me to marry her
And move into a crib in some suburbian area
I knew that this was just too good to be true
And what you're askin me to do, girl, I cannot do
You told me, ""No committments"", and you best stick to it
Oh baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Sugar Ray ]
Now I'm makin money, and it's good to be single
To mingle with the ladies while their earrings jingle
And that's the way it is, cause that's the way that I want it
When I see a pretty mommy lookin good, I'm on it
Checkin out her profile to see if she got style
Cause if she ain't a 10, she ain't worth my while
I'm all about stickin and movin with the quickness
Forget the foreplay, and let's get down to business
(Yeah, is it good? Is it good, baby?) Damn, my jim hat broke!
But still I kept strokin till her boots were smokin
And left her on the bed with her legs wide open
Tryin to kick it to me like she was my girl
But yo, I had to tell her, ain't no way in the world
Maybe it's the way I hit that thing that souped it
But no, I'm not gonna be able to do it

Steadily, it moves
Under the headlight, the big bright and shiny eye

Get off!

For the mob boss, breakin laws

I can't keep my hands clean, I can't lie

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

I done told you once you son of a bitch

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Doug Cloud,"When I was young and in my prime (in my prime!),
I left my home in caroline.
Now all I do is sit and pine, for all those folks I left behind.

I got the blue ridge mountain blues, and I sat right here to say,
""my grip is packed to travel, and I'm back to ramble,
To my blue ridge far away.""

I'm goin' to stay right by my pa, I'm goin' to do right by my ma,
I'll hang around the cabin door, no work or worry anymore.

I got the blue ridge mountain blues, goin' to see my old oak tree,
Gonna hunt the possum where the corn cob blossom,
In my blue ridge far away.
Woo!

I see a haze of snowy white, I see a window with light,
I seem to hear them both sigh, ""where is my wand'rin boy tonight? ""

I got the blue ridge mountain blues, and I stay right here to say,
""every day I'm countin' 'til I climb that mountain,
In my blue ridge far away.""

Doug Duke,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Doug Duke,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Is on the verge of becoming extinct to me

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure

Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

The tune will come to you at last.

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Come to me, run to me, come to me now
I'm rollin' my sweetheart
I'm flowin' by God

She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
And she's sweeter than saccharine at a drug store sale

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Doug Spartz,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln

Why's everybody wearing suits and ties from western, I can't believe my eyes
And whose idea was it to hang these spurs, this brand new bar don't have a sink or fur
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong I need a jukebox with a country song
Well I looked back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud
Some clown was playing record, too fast, too long and too loud
This must has been a big mistake to try and speak my mind
So they were asking me to leave, I cried out one more time

Can I have this dance my you're looking pretty
Is there something wrong did he leave you hurting
I don't mean to pry but that tear in your eye gave you away

But sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it
I think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain

If your heart is tired for the rest of your life

Tonight please give my arms that chance
If you don't feel the need for conversation
We'll just let our hearts talk while we dance

Doug Stone,"I bet you can remember back when you were five or six
That year between each Christmas seemed like ten
And things that you looked forward to seemed so far away
And being grown was a million years back then

That summer between junior-high and high school took three years
Twenty more went by till you could drive
Oh, they made them good in the old days, some would last forever
But the ones they're making now just don't survive

They just don't make years like they used to
Strange, you turn around and then they're gone
Let's make the most of each moment together
'Cause the years they're making now don't last that long

It seems like only yesterday we held our first born child
Today he's going off to school, you know
And that favorite photograph of you and me that New Year's eve
Was that lost year or fifteen years ago

When we were still just sweethearts, the days would pass so slow
Tonight, time found us snuggled up so close
All that time that just stood still, oh, so long ago
Is flying by now when you need it most

They just don't make years like they used to
Strange you turn around and then they're gone

And if you're drinking you'll start thinking of the love that went wrong

And what they don't get, I've already spent.

Said he never would understand just what she saw in him.

Doug Stone,"She was the prom queen, the world was hers
With a wave of her hand, whispered words
Hearts broken by her abilities
Addicted to the sweetness of a gentle kiss
Lost in a search for something she might never find
Never know if she don't try, the results will come in time
No time to smell the roses, let alone slow dance
Too many bad memories of forgotten romance
She walked out slammed the door
Damn him, she didn't need him
A child game she had to cloth him feed him
Alone after so long gave up hope
Convinced all men were abusive
Undependable heathens and sold dope
Mister right wasn't coming
A fact that she would have to face
She didn't have no time to waste, she had a man to raise
No man to chase, sick of living in this blasted place
No time to sit around weeping like a basket case
Her son made it all worthwhile
The only man that got to see her smile
She reminisced about her lifestyle before the baby came
She did what responsible people do, she changed

She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was my best friend, my playmate
Moved in next door just before the first grade
We ran foot races, climb trees, caught insects
Before money and sex, powder and x
Before popularity came so crucial
She had love and the feeling was mutual
We used to cut our feet barefooted in chipped glass
Now we blow smoke as we skip class
New friends came, and with them came change
The pressure was all, would lil mama maintain
She began to drift away, the distance between us grew wider
Didn't have to speak to me, I could see the hurt inside her
I hear the words out of her mouth
But they don't reflect what she really feel
I've seen the smile before I know it isn't real
Artificial happiness, superficial friends
A nonstop whirl wind, when will it all end
Her eyes roll back, she began to convulse
They searched for a heartbeat, but she had no pulse
Autopsy results show she mixed powder and downers
And none of her new friends were around her
When her family found her, but a

She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady

She was a young girl seventeen, if I recollect correctly
A baby with a baby, that baby was me
She worked everyday still it wasn't enough
World was rough, ol' girl was tough
Drop me off in the morning
Come back and get me in the afternoon
Free spirits lost being guided by the moon
Used to take me to church, try to make me a man
But hard times put drastic changes in plan
She was out there, every time she got up, she fell again
In love with a bastard, stay in and out the pen
Alcoholic addict, never tried to change himself
Beat her to a pulp, and make her blame herself
I tried to talk to her, mama you don't have to stay
Just pack your bags and go, you can walk away
She tell me about this pain, hoping I'd never experience it
Baby boy love is some serious shit, I pray for change
Eventually it came, like rays of light after days of rain
She turned her life around, walked away never to return
Still tempted by the fire, just tired of being burned

She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

Doug Stone,"I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else
Proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons
I had for hanging on

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison
Doing time, I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him
Together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time
To spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do
Not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison
Doing time, I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil

Doug Stone,"Know what I'm saying, Big Haystak
Street Flavor Records, bitch, represent
I remember when I was young
All my people told me I could
Be anything I wanted to be when I grew up
You know what I'm saying, and that's it for us
I was a big old white boy from
Tennessee that wanted to be a rap star
And that was fucking impossible

I over came opsticals did what they said couldn't be done
I went from murder dog to fire? That's me, I'm the one
The only one who held it down for lower class
Before it was cool to be white trash
You can't change the world so why try
Watch them change to tie die's
From fist fights to drive bys
I be out there late night and I'm might die
So when I'm gone say goodbye to that white guy
I dedicate this to the hags and fags
Who associate Haystak with racism and rebel flags
You fucking bitch
When you mention me speak on killer weed and body bags
Hi proportion? And burning the flag
My grand daddy's mammy was half Cherokee
My grand mamma family came from an island in Germany
And me I'm just a mixed breed from Tennessee
Everything you fake mother fuckers pretend to be

But never ran a mother fucking thing 'round here
Pioneers lets get one thing clear
We been making music for years ya hear
Hardcore you better ask about hay
I get love 'round the way like E-40 in the bay
I'm from the land of the brave
Home of the free
And there's five million other fools just like me
We the have-nots little badass kids
Momma doing bad, dad der doing a bid
And we was set free to do as we please
Reek havoc on the streets of our communities
And we didn't have no curfew
We didn't have no rules
We don't need no book bags cause we don't go to school
Imagine my middle finger
In the mother fuckin sky
Screaming CWB till I die

Hey bro what you looking for
Twenty
Auh twenty, I don't have no twenties
But I got some fat dimes
Auh you like that huh
Come back and fuck with your people ya hear

Born a bastard child who struggled with love
We congregated on the corners puffin and pushing dubs
A lack of love, a lack of understanding
A lack of compassion a lack of better parenting
The sad thing is either they don't know
Don't show
Or just don't care, well
That is till Tad and Rad?
Come to school with gauges
And start shooting up the rich kids in the faces
Mom and dad ducked in their shoes
""It was the crowd they hung around
Music that they listed to""
White boys been dying around here for years
But it never make CNN
You know why
We were put here to die
So when we kill one another
It comes as no surprise
We animals in their eyes
I represent the trial when I'm behind the mic
Can't tell me nothing about no damn stereotypes, cause I'm a

In this life we lead are tragic...

Stories he could tell
Ain't that many ever

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

We've drifted out but somehow always drifted back again

So anyway, me and the boys got together and we asked

Wouldn't mind singin' with us on what has proven itself to
Be the perfect country western song.

And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in the pickup truck
She got ran over by a damned old train.

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Doug Watkins,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
",Imagination
Doug White,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Doug Williams,"After the storm has come and gone
After the wind has already blown
After the clouds have cleared the sky
God's going to wipe these tears from my eyes
After the storm

There have been days when I hurt so bad
The load on my shoulder seems
Much more than I could stand
And there have been times when the pain inside
Was so severe, I just sit alone and cry
Then a voice spoke to me 
It was ever so gently saying
You're going to make it through
The storm hovering over you?

These heartaches I feel are just temporary 
The storm is passing over
I see the sun breaking through the clouds
There's a new day coming and it won't be long
There'll be a rainbow in the sky
I'll have a brand new song
I'll shout my troubles over
And rejoice in victory
I'm going to sail on peaceful shore
There'll be a brighter day for me

I've got to keep my head up high
No matter how hard it seems
I've gotta keep on pressin' my way 
Though the roads been rough for me
Said I will not, I shall not
I just can't give up the race
God is on my side

It's gonna be alright
The storm has come and gone",After the Storm

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time

Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me

Really don't give a damn, what none of you hoes think
How many mo' niggaz, want to try my skills
Struggling hard, I'm trying to pay my bills
Never really know, who my friend or foes
Watch my friends, and keep my enemies close
All around the world, we may go
Still remain, to be the same old song

And it seems to be, that my time is now
I remember, when they said I would be nothing
But now that nothing is something, and I be bringing 'em down
Sho' I'm a clown, nothing but the skill when I be wrecking
Up out of Texas, with diamonds all over my necklace
I keep they head checking, pass to profession
And can't nobody contest, 'cause that's the way we are a legend
You better count your blessings, 'cause I'm sick and tired of this thang
And while I be blowing my Mary Jane, I'm chilling with thugs
Sipping on mud, trying to keep my head long from slugs
Guerilla Maab on the rise, and we keeping it crunk

It was all a dream, other people said I would never be
Nothing, now collecting dividends to ride a Benz
Down I-10, dropping the top in the wind
With a friend once again, yelling out fuck friends
Bubble lens, when I be stacking my ends
Trying to see, could you really picture me
S3 with a JVC, 18's in the trunk ready to beat
Chunking deuce to hoes, and burning off on them freaks
I'm a ghetto superstar, and a certified thug
So all you certified scrubs, get certified slugs
Southside till I'm dead, gotta be moving they head
Gotta keep my head up, for my brother in the FED
This is dedicated to niggaz, who be turning they back
Slamming all of they do's, and burning off in they Lac

I took a big six hundred to the shop, and told em candy blue my Benz
I put a bunch of money in my billfold, 'cause I'm real cold
When I'm on the microphone
Everybody want to kill, to get a piece of my mill
But I'mma weigh my skills, better surrender or bite my chrome
'Cause I'mma fight my homeboys, write my own bars
When it comes, to the pen and pad
Thinking about the swine I had, and everything I own
Could the shit wasn't bad, but in reality nigga
I was fucked up low life, living in sin
But I was given a chance, to start pimping a pen
Now Blockbuster, Soundwaves and Sam Goody's
Be running out of my product, and re-order again
And certify myself, half a million sold

A nigga want to plex, put his face all in the flo'

Douglas Joe Rommereim,"As I passed by a fine hotel
I saw a little girl, she sure looked swell
I gave her the eye, I tried to carry on
That big black Cadillac pulled up, huh, she was gone

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Oh, that should have been me
Driving that Cadillac

A little later on, five minutes past
And I saw a lady, she had a lot of class
I was trying to write her name down in my book
Her husband pulled out, give me one of them
Hot real dirty looks

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
The moral of the story is that it
Being her chaperone

Down in the corner was this real sharp cat
Had a 300 dollar platform shoes and a 100 dollar cowboy hat
He was standing on the curb by a fancy Buick down the floor
And this voice from inside says ""Come on sugar, let's go""

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
By now you know who that should have been
Driving that Dynaflow

I hate to get heavy but listen to this

I ate some fish 'n' chips, I felt okay
I passed by a fancy cafe
I saw a man eating one of them T-bone stakes
He hollered, gracious stand by the side feeling him, Lordy

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Where was I? I was standing outside with ice cream and cake

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me gettin' my natural kick
That should have been me
Rubbin' on with a chick

Douglas Niedt,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Just talking to the rain
You said I've been driving you crazy
And it's keeping you away

So just give me one good reason
Tell me, why I should stay?
'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
Saying things we were never meant to say

And I, take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I've been waiting for a chance to let you in

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me
You'll see everything is alright
If I just breathe

Well, it's ours, so overrated
Not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wonder in which way?

And I, give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize?
I've been waiting till I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me
You'll see everything is alright
If I just breathe, breathe

So I whisper and I'm
Hoping you hear me
Do you hear me?

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright

Thanks but I'm broken

As your insides fall to pieces
Shattered by the silent treatment

Feigning your humility

Most common observations that you make
Drown me out in conversation

Wash away my interest in your wake

We made it and I know we would

Down by Law,"I think it began back in 1992 - flames and riots and my innocence was through
The flames got put out but the hatred stayed so strong
Burning up the streets like an urban napalm
White boy white boy - why you gotta act so proud?
Black black boy - why you gotta talk so loud?
Whit boy white boy - so afraid you buy a gun
Black boy black boy - so busy hating everyone
Nothing comes free/ nothing comes free
And this town ain't half of what it used to be
Nothing comes free/ nothing comes free
Do you hear the sound of world burning down?
I don't like fear and I don't like feeling danger
Now I'm driving through this ghost town like a sad lone ranger
Amid the ruins of all these urban sights and sounds
Seeing those places sometimes it still brings me down
White boy white boy - you're so busy building fences
Black boy black boy - when you gonna come to your senses
White boy white boy - anger shouldn't be your new song
Black boy black boy - if you hate because of color, you've got it all wrong
That's when I said well, nothing comes free

'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you

Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman

Whole lotta Rosie

Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

Down Low,"This song goes out to all the people who out there who have broken relationships,
Misunderstanding and no trust, 
And it goes a little something like this
So long goodbye
Are you ready? 
Here we go, down low style

Uh, uh, check it out
Many nights, I lay alone in my bed, 
Looking back on the letter she wrote, I just read
I can't forget the moments and times I have of you, 
Is she save, dear lord, to my loneliness rules
Shall I pick up the phone and just dial or maybe shall I think it over, for a while?
The pain is so deep every time in my sleep and I record it all when I weep
But now we stay distant from one another, 
New people in our lives that we claim as lovers
Touching her really don't quite feel the same, 
If you ever been in love once feelings never change
I hope one day she realizes and see she could have it all if she´d stay with me
Some nights I wish I wouldn't break down and cry, 
But live must take its course
So long goodbye?

So long goodbye, there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial oh dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side (c'mon)
So long goodbye (so long goodbye baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry (no need to cry baby), I will be back here in times of need to be by your side

Can you understand that the way that I feel or life tearing us apart for real
I wish I could playback time, 
But she got her life and I got mine
Before I have to go and before I die, 
It's a struggle to live to keep my dreams alive
But one day I swear I'm gonna reach my goal and just to be on top, 
Without selling my soul
And maybe then we can work this out, 
And maybe then you'll understand what I'm talking about
Cause what I do, take concentration, to keep up the life in steady rotation
But one thing I want you to know in this song, 
I'll be your right to correct your wrong
If you need me, yo!, I'll be here by your side, 
To vanish away all your pain, so long goodbye?

So long goodbye, there´s no need to cry no more, so baby just dial oh dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side (c'mon)

C'mon, uh
Can't tell you why I'm leaving, can't tell you where I'm going to
Can't tell you where I'll be upon of that
Can't tell you why I'm leaving, can't tell you where I'm going to
Can't tell you where I'll be upon of that

So long goodbye baby
Uh, bring it back yo

So long goodbye (no need to cry baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side
So long goodbye (so long goodbye baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry (no need to cry baby), I will be back here in times of need to be by your side

He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Under your spell, in the magic you inspire.
Every farewell, sets me on fire
And I find it all so funny,
Like a joke without a punchline.

My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you,
The light that you let off is gold.
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room,
These chills didn't come from the cold.
They came from you.
They came from you.

I hear your voice like an ocean,
Washing over me I'm frozen stuck in time.
And I swear, I never seen the likes of you before.

These chills didn't come from the cold,
They came from you.

See I was doing my own thing 'till you came across my path,
Made me feel like singing, but usually I rap.
But how can I explain the things you do to me,
I'm acting all the proper words and phrases,
Hold up lemme get back to that,
Because I'm awe struck, star struck,
Turned around from my hard luck
Let you know that from bar one,
You are the one and that's bar none,
I'll try the best to control myself,
At least that's what I told myself,
But inside I just bought a farm,
You're the one that just sold that house,
Got my heart in that headlock,
I'mm hosing on and you hold the belt,
I mean this in the best way when I tell you that you're cold as hell
That makes no sense, but neither does this feeling,
I know that my time is short, but next to you, I touch the ceiling.

The light that you let off is gold.
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room,

Detached harmonies, all the airways scream dissonance
And we know of broken life, broken homes,
Broken hearts and broken bones,
Recycling the paper of a crying world's suicide note and
We're so blue, we're so blue. 
We're so blue, we're so blue

See the world spinning round
A sucking hole that souls go down
Embrace the sorrow of today because repentance finds a way
Only His blood can heal our wounds
Only His blood can heal our wounds
And if repentance finds a way, what's left today to be

Blue, so blue
So blue, so blue 

A final symphony,
The precipice too close, you're scaring me back away
Sin is real, it doesn't feel, It always, only always, steals.
Run to the cross the only joy that's real.

So blue, so blue
So blue, so blue",So Blue

He's stuck reminiscing of the wonders of the glory days.

There's a girl, day after her wedding.
She doesn't feel any different than before in many ways.

""Such is life"" you wisper passively,
Where did my dream go?

This is not what I imagined 
But this is real life 
In the trenches and 
We are living the dream.

Everyday comes with the promise that it could be great
If you wanted and 
We are living the dream,
Living the dream.

As for me, I'm singing a new song.
I'm not gonna dwell inside 
Some alternate reality
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

I feel free 
I'm making the best of it
I'm seeing with eyes that find the heart and soul of true beauty

Cuz every breath could 
Build up something, 
Tear it down, or just 
Leave it be,
So what'll it be?

This is not what I imagined 
But this is real life 
In the trenches and 
We are living the dream.

Everyday comes with the promise that it could be great
If you wanted and 
We are living the dream,
We're livin the dream.

Those with the richest lives, 
That could be you and I.
Let's answer the call tonight, 
We could be satisfied, satisfied.

Well, this is not what I imagined 
But this is real life 
In the trenches and 
We are living the dream.

Everyday, love makes the promise
That we can be great 
If we wanted and 
We are living the dream.

Highs and lows we'll take on together,
Choosing joy whatever the weather, and
We are living the dream, 
Living the dream,
Living the dream.

You're never ready
That's why they call it?

Tell me, are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be?
This is scaring me

Seems every time I try
To rest my heart is when
The rush is back again
Maybe this time I'll
Make it work somehow
Guess I'm gonna find out now

I get a rush
And it's love for sure
What else can it be
Something beckons me
And I go back for more
Ooo such a rush
Can't pass love by
What else can I do
Something tells me to
Give it one more try

I'm not gonna die if love passes me by
It goes and comes around, I know
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me
Waiting for the rush to come and find me
I still remember when love was an angel send
It will be back again

The master that we serve has shit our lives away
We're still enslaved, we're still enslaved

Everything's set now you're told what to do

Seeing truth now
Nothing from the sweat that was stole from you
Cutting yourself
Looking at your wrists as the blood hits the floor

Cause people buy em and fly em in a tape

When time's gettin too tough to take
You need an outlook (yes I do)
But not the kind that shock ya

Otherwise you might suffo-

Of a sound which some call a trend

But yo, rap is here to stay no matter who they say it's dyin
Cause the fans keep multiplyin
So as long as rhymes stay rugged, and beats stay tight

Respond to the vibes picked up in the street
Where they emanate - we innovate
And invent newer ways of droppin the content

Surroundin the issue, to make it official

Lettin the world know what goes on
See, we came to claim a zone in rap
Not on the map, and watch people adapt
To hintin to us and label it our sound
But who will be the one to wear the MC crown
The race is on, it's up for grabs
Civil rights, some will bite, some will kill and take cabs
Take it from me, I used to drive one
Had to quit the night I caught a live one
But now I travel at my own pace
Like to feel the bass up around my waist
Just like a seat belt, kinda keepin me strapped in
Cause when I rhyme I'm the sky captain

And understand why I'm hittin for the Def Jam team

You try to front and say that it was too dark
To see the ball, otherwise you woulda caught it
Well, catch this, we want you to support it

Yo, we're not late, we must be just ahead of our time

Bring a king, and we'll open a school
And just reach and teach like it's a day at the beach

And all, in '91 we're gonna have a ball
Because you shook my tree, and now my apple's gonna fall
To the ground, so polish up the crown
And pass it down to the world renowned
Cause here go we defyin gravity and name it after me
The be	-o-s-see-o M-o-n-e-why, gee
And my man Sam Sever, cause both of us together
Form the D-Sci, and we won't separate ever
He's rollin with me, so I roll with him
And we don't judge each other by the color of our skin
It's of no relevance to our intelligence
I rest my case with a fresh taste of elements

Doyle Bramhall,"Hello there, my old friend
Not so long ago it was til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road we started over again

You're livin our dream oh you on top
My mind is achin,' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin life by the drop

Up and down the road in our worn down shoes
Talkin about good things and singin the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time

You're livin our dream oh you on top
My mind is achin,' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin life by the drop

No wasted time, we're alive today
Churnin up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end

Said she'd known me a long time

And a full moon in the last week

The wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire glows we can warm our souls
Makin' rainbows in the coals.

Doyle Lawson,"There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow  way
For what few coins, the congregation could afford

Dressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's cornerstone
It was there, in that little mountain church house
I first heard the words, I based my life upon

At the all day, Sunday singing, with dinner on the  ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While the bothers and the sisters who've gone on to Gloryland
Slept in  peace in the maple grove nearby

Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's cornerstone
It was there in that little mountain church house
I first heard the words I based my life upon

Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's cornerstone

Stand affirm 'cause you are the aura of the mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope, you are the future
You are the past, you are the grandfather of civilization
That is why A N see wants old dogs to sit

The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and inta another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover
The African man seems to be everywhere
If there are people in the world
Who knows that right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home Africa

Martin Luther King, Mandela you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Africa for me and Africa far you de Klerk
It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an African way
Hello Africa tell me you you're doin'

Mmm, jumping on the mike, it 'cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mike, it 'cause me awesome affections
What you say to me, me a fun and me warm
Spend some me a time on the Tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize what me are
What me a really want, me not fly
No I am just coolin', come on now just set it off

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north
Following my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds
You know right is never wrong

Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Africa
Here comes the news from the mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth
Right, rapping is digging down river, north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side

My name is Alban, mi is a dentist, mi DJ here, mi DJ there

Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this
What we stood for ""fuck that fame and that glitz""

The meek shall inherit the earth

Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?

That working round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block

Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?
How 'bout this big ol' hole in the ozone?

Might not be in the back of the bus

Ain't no assistance in AIDS
Ain't nothing affirmative about you're actions

How fair, how fair, how fair

How dare, how dare
How dare, how dare
How dare she call my name 
How dare she call my name 

Well I don't believe in god and I don't believe I can
How strange, how strange, how strange
I was raised here in the country and the land made me a man
Now shes erased it, had me learn it all again

How dare, how dare
How dare, how dare
How dare she call my name
How dare she call my name

For her mother I'd pull water
Dig field, work for her father
I'd shine my boots and then I'd cut my hair

Said I'm moving for the west but you stay here

Will you do the trick?

I been split down the middle
Call a doctor quick!
I'm in need of a better half
Will you do the trick?

I just can't find my way all alone
Man this fog is so thick
Won't you shine your light for me?
Will you do the trick?

I've thrown everything at the wall
But nothing will stick
Won't you hand around a while?
Won't you do the trick?

I could build you a home on high
I could lay each and every brick
Will you be there by my side?
Will you do the trick?",Do the Trick
Dr. Dog,"I'm aware of the danger.
I think it's okay.
I was never that young.
I was born old and gray.
Alone and in shambles, 
It's alright, it's okay.
The storm cloud has broken, 
The haze burned away.

I was 23 miles from the Chesapeake Bay.
I'd worn through my shoes, always walking away.
Seems like all of my troubles roll and tumble this way.
The bottle has broken, the ghost has escaped.

Oh no.
I can't walk around with my feet off the ground.
And when they hit, although we are strangers, 
Run away, run away, run away.
I have.

I didn't talk much to strangers, I bled my friends dry.
Hard, hard livin', yet I was hardly alive.
But I kept on rollin' and now I know why.
The storm clouds have broken a hole in the sky.

We'll get away from the shelter, get away from the storm.
Get away from the mountains, get away from the shore.
Get away from the hang-ups that destroy the mind.
Get away from the darkness, get away from the light.


Oh no.
I can't walk around with my feet off the ground.
And when they hit, although we are strangers, 
Run away, run away, run away.
I have.",Get Away
Dr. Dog,"I walk with you everywhere I go
But it don't seem like you know
I sang your praise like an old songbird
But I don't suppose you heard

I climbed my voice to the top of my lungs
But I'm standing on the tip of my tongue
And all I see only looks the same
The picture is the frame

Oh soul of mine, look out and see
My time that is to be

I fight for you
My love is war
The battle of Baltimore
I took you back then
I'll take you down the road
You're with me on my own

Dr. Dog,"What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all

My thoughts are wicked and rotten
My goat don't wanna be gotten
And I had my fill of the whippoorwill
When he broke into song I shot him
Leave me alone

What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all

Well the train is loaded and leaving
And the Lord only knows I don't need it
And I snub my nose when the whistle blows
But it's never enough to get even
Get out of here and leave me alone
Get out of here and leave me alone

The moon can do what he pleases
He can cry so much that he sneezes
And if a falling star falls in my yard
Well I'll pick up the pieces
Get out of here

What does it take to be lonesome?

Dr. Dog,"I put on my clothes like a body guard
I put the dogs on patrol in my own back yard
I don't wanna fight but I'm constantly ready
And I don't rock the boat, but it's always unsteady

There's an elephant in my head
And I tip toe around it
There are eggshells on the floor
Therefore I never touch the ground

It's like that old black hole,
No matter how you try,
You set out each day
Never to arrive

I got my eyes on the prize
But it looks just like a mystery
And it all goes by on the lonesome trail to victory
I'm drawing in the blinds, I got my own four walls
And the show really starts once the curtain falls

Take this thorn from my side
Fix this chip on my shoulder
Time is racing with the clock
And I ain't getting any older

It's like that old black hole,
No matter how you try.

It's like that old black hole,

And I wrap up my body tight
With the sun in my eyes
I step into the night

Like the mystery in the dark
Oh, it's just another kind of light

I don't expect you to believe me
But everything is alright
I don't make rules for a living
I don't do tricks for a dime

I was born on a good day,
Deaf, dumb and blind.
Who am I to tell the truth?
I don't even know what it is.

I don't know how to say it but I know that I can show you.
I don't know how to say it but I know that I can show you.

I tie my boots up tight
And I head straight for bed
There's a pistol and a crystal
Underneath my pillow

There's a tender heart
Inside that ugly armadillo
""These are tears of joy,""
Cried the weeping willow

There's a spirit in the air
And there ain't no way around it
I was not prepared to lose it
On the moment that I found it

It's like that old black hole,
No matter how you try.

Dr. Dog,"I don't wanna waste time
I don't wanna stay here
Deciding whether we should stay or leave baby
Why you wanna go now?
I don't wanna go now
Even though our friends are gone
And the lights are on

You keep saying nobody cares if I'm here except me
Well baby, that's enough
I don't wanna let go
People they get so old
I hate when people say ""those were the days""
Well what are these then?

I really should have stayed home
So many people I don't really know anymore
And I got nothing to say but I don't know
I just get so bored

Over and over I get impatient and angry
When I feel like I've gone soft
It's such a drag, I just get dumber and dumber
I can't talk, I can't talk.

Dr. Dog,"I never really left. I was never gone.
I never strayed too far from where I was
I never noticed it. But now I know…
I come out for a minute and go back again
It goes on. It goes on

So strange it seems to want so bad.
To pine for things I never had
So far the gate. So far the fence.
I come out for a minute and go back again
It goes on. It goes on

And the cuckoo sang
With his hoot and twang
He come out for a minute he went back again
Getting out of the rain
And the cuckoo sang, and the cuckoo sang
Come out for a minute, he went back again
Stone cold cuckoo! Hexed and hoodooed. Here!

Well, I was once just like you.
Born to roam and ramble too.
So strange it seems to fade to blue",Cuckoo
Dr. Dog,"The man appeared to me inside that yellow wood
I’d carved his name in the dirt, at the crossroads where we stood
He said, “Are you looking for directions?”
I said, “Gee, I wish you would. Which way to the infinite road that unwinds from within.”

He said, “Follow the distant light”
Oh’ you know I will! Follow the distant light, just a little bit over the hill
Follow the distant light and although you’ll never near it
You can travel on forever and you’ll never be back here
I said, “alright”

The stranger appeared to me, he hopped down from his tree
I said, “I can give you anything, but you know that nothing’s free.”
Well I could take it or leave it. I said, “well what do you want from me.”
He said, “nothing much really, just a small token of appreciation 
that would mean so little to man like you and so much to a man like me.”

Gimme the distant light
Oh no I cannot do it
Gimme the distant light, he said through his teeth
Gimme the distant light
I said, “I ain’t quite yet through with it”
As I saw it shining dimly through the branches of his tree, I walked on

Following the distant light
Like the way some people look for parking
Following the distant light, and tripping all over my feet
But following the distant light
And I know if I keep walking, I’ll never touch it, 
but as long as I move it’ll shine down on me",Distant Light
Dr. Dog,"I fell asleep around quarter to four
I had a dream my baby didn’t want me no more
I was drowning in a sea of love
I was swallowed up by the water above
Oh water above, oh water below
Take me away in your undertow
I’ve been drinking from a broken cup
And a long way down means a long way up

Yeah a long way down, means a long way up

When I came to
I was feeling high
I got a telephone call from a friend of mine
Coming through so loud and clear
Yeah he was picking me up
Man he felt so near
When I hung up, and I looked around
I could hear the rain hit the cold cold ground
But there was sunshine just because
and it didn’t matter what the weather was

Yeah a long way down, means a long way up…

she was the only
she was a mystery

I went to London down to the dungeon
I’ve been to hell if I’ve been any other way
If I’m not mistaken I wasn’t taken
I found my own damn way down there for love.
But can it last all my life, as it passes?
Love can it last all my life, as it passes?
Love can it last all my life, as it passes?

I met her in a costume
Underneath a full moon
Love from the stormiest skies.
The whole masquerade stopped
Yet another shoe dropped
Just another kind of disguise

I’m holding on, don’t ask me why
I am afraid the only answer is a lie.
I tell myself the strangest stories,
I ain’t a crow I found a crooked way to fly oh love

And another time, different house, different song,
different friend, different band, he had real long hair,
pulled the record out, put the needle on and freaked me out.

Marlboro reds, white car, blue eyes, cd in, cd in, cd in, a cd in a car stereo and it freaked me out.

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that

So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?)
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?)
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now

I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)

(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck

I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes

That I'm on the flow ho
But they can't hang with my type og swing

Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on

Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching but I just watch them hang
So on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak, now everybody
Peeping out they windows when they hear me beating up the streets

Dr. Dre,"Wake up, jumped out my bed
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Now, I'm holding a dove, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what)
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I pick up I lick up, ya face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift then forget Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knocking em out the box 'n'
Knocking em out their sock 'n'
'Cause Robin is rocking
Breaking em down to the slab
Taking em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle, huh?
See ya watch and creak without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothing more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull then pull it!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and what the fuck
Do what I must and what I must is bust
The bubble or choose some trouble, forty-due's
So stick to my Luger, Lady of Rage is coming through

(Some cool shit, some cool shit)

I fears no one, I makes em cool off like a polar cap
Lynching as I hits, misses the rolling back?
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope stuck on the topic so stop and gimme my pops, kid
I'm living large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to broke art so the faggots
This young black kid, I'm mercenary, merciless
Murdering mega some niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worst than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, ripping the lyrics I'm leaving
Rough wind flex too complex, wrecks, then I'm peace
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
Ya quick to talk shit I whip your ass nigga
So watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
Ya wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make stagger, ob' skills and jimmy ragged
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Sold like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment up a track on crack
And I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off cheap
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th

Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas they pull they strap
'Cause, umm, police them come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boom, stomping black soldier
Here to teach and mould ya

Flex wicked styl-e, bomping be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Bop, bop, bop now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild, every night they shoot
It's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Teflon vest for your chest
Anytime ya step into my hood
But that'll do you no good

Indo smoke in ya lungs, like that
And you can lift it, on, and a fist a bomb
Takin' away like hell gone Vietnam

In my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
They wish they was a runnin' up in reality

Dr. Dre,"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get the fuck out after you're done

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Get the fuck out after you're done
And I hope in my ride to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
([Snoop:] But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this

Bitch!

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get the fuck out after you're done
And I hope in my ride to make a quick run

To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to long beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I put my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? [Snoop:] Why? [echoed 3X]
'cause a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks [Snoop:] Why? [echoed 3X]
'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out
Now

I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking' county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit... I'm heart-broken but I'm still locked
Man, fuck a bitch!

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get the fuck out after you're done
And I hope in my ride to make a quick run

I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'cause I'm doin my own thingdown with the swang
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck

And now I gotta do some
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the floor ho
But they can't hang with my type on swang
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung

I got my glock cocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated

I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
with their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker i'm Dre
so listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
rollin' in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches, clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by, 'cause I'm too hard to lift
and no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-are-E, from the CPT
on a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as i pop my top ya trip

No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists it's just

that gangster shit, that makes the gang of snaps, 
word to the motherfucking streets
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats, that I
hit ya with that I, get ya with
as I groove in my four on these, hitting the switches
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
but before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Reme Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
on my dick, cause my four on hit
pancake front and back, side to side and all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
on my way to the strip, now I'm just flossing
Checking my rear view, cause niggas they will do
jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching but I just watch them hang
so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak, now everybody
peeping out they windows when they hear me beating up the streets
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say, every single motherfucking day, yo
But I ain't tripping I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I'll be

Dr. Dre,"This is dedicated to the niggaz that was down from day one
Welcome to the aftermath
Like we always do about this time
Welcome to the aftermath

The aftermath, a second growth
The period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from The Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep, you ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?
The aftermath brings to you some of the best
Hip-Hop and R&B on the planet

We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're here

Watch yourself, peep the blow up
From state-to-state we're touchin' home
No matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system

Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music, the different sound view
R&B, Rap, whatever flavor, kid, it's all new
So say we bring it with the East and the West

The final results, the aftermath touchin' every coast
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest
If they business is tight

'cause keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying
Everything that we touch
And leave somethin' for our children

Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Gets ya free, yeah)
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, hey, keep on doin' it

Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is)
Keep on doin' it, ya gotta keep doin' it, keep on, keep on, yeah
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is that gets ya free, yeah)
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, oh yeah, oh

Ya gotta, you gotta keep on doin it, doin' it, doin' it
Aftermath is gonna keep on doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, yeah

Dr. Dre,"[Chorus: Repeat 2X] 
I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montiego Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...

[Chorus] 

Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'ma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't want to lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that why'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

[Chorus:]  

This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the forty five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...
Been there, done that...

Dr. Dre,"It's fuckin ackrite
Question is can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
Have fun and get blunted on a Sunday afternoon
My nigga Babe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uh drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? Ayo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice

Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say

Dr. Dre,"Now this this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (wife)

I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin strong, but comin home, to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas, Texas - assed-out

Now this this is one of them occasions

Naw ""ho"" is short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin tales of bein pregnant, catchin Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic - she's psychotic, rockin his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bouncin than a Zapp, she will doo-wah-diddy-ya
Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'mma see you on the rebound (what what?) D.P. style

Now this this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin it right

But you can't make a ho a housewife

Dr. Dre,"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin why
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
He had talent too I had plans on watchin him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go

Listen
Listen
Listen
Listen

If you wanna know why {why I live my life}
The way that I do {cause I got to get this money}
So don't worry about me {cause I know my way around}
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you

There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

Lurkin through the turf, think how I'mma just work

Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face

The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!

Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?

Dr. Dre,"It's fuckin ackrite
Question is can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
Have fun and get blunted on a Sunday afternoon
My nigga Babe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uh drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? Ayo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite

Niggas still player hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas ringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin the window down (em: hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin to job hunt
Niggas got AK's, niggas is way crazier
Than Dre was back in his n.w.a. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always trying to play rambo with they ammo

Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got rugers and m-14's with enough
Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin'
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Niggas doing brothers in worse than the klan
Can't even stand, in front of your building and chill
Without yielding, twelve-year-old children that kill
Blood spilling, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs
Filling the sky, usually drilling the one
That wasn't willing to die, yes sir in the killing field
I got my, life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
Question me, bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A soldier of fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on

Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately

Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos

Dr. Dre,"Aww they say uhh
A black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin' Earth, is her momma
It's her momma that told her,
""Get a man that got a good job girl,
Make sure he got a good car girl,
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin' girl""
What happened to just fallin' in love with a nigga with a bus pass
Just 'cause you loved a nigga
But I'm the pimp motherfucker
I gotta be the player

Biggest hoes, on planet Earth
Are walkin' through the motherfuckin' neighborhood
You knew when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you?
The ol' 'keep a nigga baby'
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here, 'cause that nigga ain't shit""
How 'bout being a woman, and tellin' the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a hoe
Tell the kid
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here, but he a good nigga
'Cause he take care of his real family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin' to keep, a nigga that I wanted",Ed-Ucation
Dr. Dre,"Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat

While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic

And tell your friends where the dick's at

Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hitman hit it; damn bitches

Chicken head, chicken fed, with a dick in yo mouth

We can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
That your pussy's been tampered with
Then you show him the new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick
You be workin it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin digging through some records instead
But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hookup somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya
He's always trying to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffing girl
Cause I just wanna

Fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin with
Baby was a virgin.. that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (see-ya!)

A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sit back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

And Firm Fiascoes - assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feed me mangoes, the other lightin my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (what?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that sixty-four Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
Cause we rebels over here, I smell Chronic in the air
That means we takin over this year

Light Speed, blazin Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate thai weed
Or we might be sippin on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas

I hang among hustlers, I slang and hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
Cause gangbangin is the active, activity
Where I be livin B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you
Slippin, without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas takin out like chores I meet whores on tours
Jeans hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores
We on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools ""RETREAT!"" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream-on-stars
To get loot and crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggas
At bar one, it's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sodom
Newenze gots my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me you hear?

A message to God

Since you finishin' 'em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein' him leave, or watchin him go

So don't worry about me (don't worry, don't worry worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

You'se a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit' you

For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot

Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru

Laid back in the shack, play this track

Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money

Dr. Dre,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming O.Gs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
Nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fucking with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
Lookin' at us, now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just having fun just watching it fly by

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know

Dr. Dre,"What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube, was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was banging with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'mma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first drew with
Claiming that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down! Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About 5 bank accounts, 3 ounces and 2 vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

Aight, hold up hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got something to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(The fuck!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right?) just know this shit

Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed whose throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like ""The Chronic"" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your sixty-four, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimpin repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'

I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the lo-lo's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back (So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Right back up in ya mothafuckin' ass, 9-5 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky, ooh wee!
Put it in the air, oh, you's a fool DR",Still D.R.E. [LP Version]
Dr. Dre,"I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!)
Rock on with your bad self
I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!)

I rock on with my bad self cause it's a must
It's the Lady Of Rage still kicking up dust
So umm, let me loosen up my bra strap
And umm, let me boost ya with my raw rap
Cause I'm-a break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, ya best believer
This grand diva's runnin shit with the speed of a cheetah, meet a
Lyrical murderer, I'm servin em like two scoops of chocolate
Check it how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwin bolos, ya better roll a Rolo
To find out I'm the number one solo, uhh
The capital are-A now take it to the G-E
I bring the things to light, but you still can't see me
I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style
For those that try to punk me, here's a Pamprin child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know

Ain't no doubt about it, I'm the undisputed
So what you uhh, wanna do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks
So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call em head spinners
I got the tongue that has outdone anyone
From the rising to the setting of the sun
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass, poom
Boom, bam, God, damn!
I'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks
Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give em
Let it hit em, split em, did it now I'm rid of em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!)
Rock on with your bad self

Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Oh shit, I'm the shit!
You can't get with the Rage then tough tit-ty
I pi-ty the fool, that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude (ooooh!)
You wanna get with the wickedness, with that
Big body girl that's kickin it, rippin it apart like Jason
You'll be chasin a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up, what you wanna nut up
Like cashew, don't you know that I will mash you? For real,
That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA
(So what you gotta say?)

But you gotta give credit when credit is due
Women back down and bow down to my motherfucking homegirl

She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs
Handcuffed and she busts
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up

Dr. Dre,"Heah hah hah!

Aiy baby, aiy baby... aiy baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker
Steady long, steady long nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)
and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through
Two in the mornin and the party's still jumpin
cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room gettin it on
and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)
So what you wanna do, sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yeah!
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
beeeitch, I'm just

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'
And I'll be

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)

Dr. Dre,"As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me",Murder Was the Case [Soundtrack]
Dr. Dre,"Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flagging me down
Saying, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Hey yo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, if you ain't up on things
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thing, to gang-bang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon 'cause
I drops bombs like Platoon (hey nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't want to be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well

Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fucking chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruff-neck
Now everybody scream 'nough respect to the X
'Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfucking name
Serial killer, serial killer, serial killer
