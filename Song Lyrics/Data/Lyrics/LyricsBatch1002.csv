Maps,"My memory
Feels like it's playing with me
These things I know
Yeah, I know

The sun will end with you
Need help to cut on through
Can only feel this way
When silence comes

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

Been here before
It won't happen no more
These things I know
Yeah, I know

They get into your mind
I guess you know the signs
Can only feel this way
When silence comes

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

In the most callous of ways
Yeah, this is where it's at
I'm quite aware of that

So please, just leave
What you've become
It'd be a mess for anyone

You're such a chameleon
It just ain't right
To treat folks so wrong
Then you turn
Into everyone's clown

Girl, it's a drag
To have you around
Things we lost in the fire
How we gonna get high?

I can't just leave

You're such a chameleon

Means nothing right now
You take me for a comedian
Who ain't got no clue
How this should be done

Well baby
I'm telling you now
I'll be long gone
When your ship goes down
Turning the mind
Is that interior turn

Where you simply say, yes
Where you say, I will
Where you say, okay

Maps,"You disappear and throw your mind
Your rules form nothing most the time
A fitting tribute no one hears
So let 'em have it, lose your fears

People will say, it's the coward's way out
People don't know what this was ever about
They treat you like pornography
As everything is shattering

There is someone for everyone
But when that love has been and gone
You settle for another one
Whether they be right or wrong
Whether there is love or none

You live only for the one you lost
Born for nothing, to abyss
And nothing worth this wasted wish
An emptiness on which to cry
Your rules are useless most the time

So, one last statement of intent
And boldly break that routine sent
From years ago and cry and sing
As everything is shattering

You know I never blamed you
For all the things we've been through
But life just ain't the same
As failure comes again

Everything is shattering",Everything Is Shattering
Maps,"So, let me begin with
Laying down the state we're in
With the pills and the gin
I can handle 'bout anything
But this is out of control

Do what you like to me
But please, don't hurt her man
'Cause I will hit you, hard as I can
But that ain't really the plan you see

Please, don't get me wrong
But you can't knock
What you've never done
It ain't always fun
But at least you'll be living some

So get the fuck off my case
Yeah, she is a legend, man
I don't doubt that
And I will screw it up
I'm used to that

But going out in style
Beats going out insane... I'm going

And we'll spend our lives
Like a fortune is burned
But maybe tomorrow we won't

Maranatha Music,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around, oh

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say, he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, “Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away”

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', “Catch me if you can”

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', “Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day”

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump

Creations revealing Your majesty
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring

You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable
Awesome, we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
Your are amazing God!
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go?
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?
Who imagined the Sun and gives source to it's light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?
None can follow

I left my home
With a pain in my heart
Not a word of goodbye
To the ones that I loved
I'm taking a train

To the lights and the smoke

Here's my experience

Have no feelings
Have no sex
I wonder who to pick up next
Playland scandal
Pocket weighs you down
Machine handle
Goes down
I lose all my money
Trying to make a killing
Can't even make my fare back home
So this is fun city

Have no feelings
Have no sex
Wonder who
To pick up next

I tried to make friends
Tried to make amends
I sunk so low
That it's hard to climb out
I've nowhere to live
But I've so much to give
I found the hard way
What's life all about

Have no feelings
Have no sex
I wonder who to pick up next

I'm all alone
And I'm lost in this city
Being paraded
Feeling degraded
I wanted love
And I thought this was the way
But I'm only young
And I'm often this wrong

Have no feelings
Have no sex
Wonder who to pick up next
I have no morals
Have no innocence
I'm quite straight
Just playing for rent.

Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Thinking how lonesome I've grown
All alone
In my room 
In my room
Where every night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending she's late
And I sit and I wait
Over there is the picture we took
When I made her my bride
Over there is the chair where I held her
Whenever she cried
Over there by the window the flowers she left
Have all died

I was the boy with the angel's eyes
And the blush in surprise
When you hold my hand in full view
Now I'm so wrecked that my eyes bleed
Watch me recede
Nails curl back
From the quick as they
Curl with my lips

Standing limp in the pool of the light
So callous and cruel
Bones are piercing me through
And the shadow of you
Is the shadow of my former self
A quick recollection and smile for old times
Sometimes I feel like I'm being unkind
Skintight yet sallow
Saddened by the shallow
Reaching for the glow

At the end of the tunnel
Somewhere up the ladder stands
I shout as the car glides
Over the kerb to the wall
And the hiss of the steam is the siren
Drawing me onto the rocks
Always as ever in no man's land
With my driver slumped over my wheel",My Former Self
Marc Almond,"He woke to the sound of the birds in the morning
Felt charged with a new lease of life
Time to break out of his present surroundings
A mother, a child and a wife
He'd not said good-bye to his last thread of childhood
It lay just beyond his front gate
So he packed just a few things
And he packed in his job
And he prayed he'd not left it too late

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

Joy held his heart
As he took to the road
Cast all his sorrow
To the breeze
Knew in his heart
It was the right thing to do
For he had to search out
His belief
Spring came and fall went
The year ran away
Love, hate and heartache ran too
Felt himself drift
Into memories of home
And the loneliness he lived on through

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

And he'd learnt about life
But he'd lost out on love
He was no longer only a boy
There were lines on his face
From the sun and the wind
But no lines there through
Laughter or joy

Shoes full of holes
But with fire in his soul
He walked down the dirt beaten track
Mother was gone
But his wife and child were living on
And they cried
""It's the boy who came back""
Goodbye through the evening
Goodbye through the night
Goodbye through the dreams
Through the sleep
Goodbye to our yesterdays
Hello tomorrow
It seems we were destined to meet

""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""",The Boy Who Came Back

Every day it fills me
Contempt
Every day it kills me
Contempt
Every tear that blinds me
Contempt
Building up inside me

You came crawling out the woodwork
Like some ghost from my past
With stories 'bout me
That I'd long since forgot
Telling me tales of how big you are now
But I know you as nothing
As nothing you got
You'd split me wide open
And spill all my beans
Because you think
That I still think
Something of you
You'd run away with everything
That I have
Take all my soul, sense and dignity too

Loving is the saddest game to play

Marc Almond,"Lying in her own asylum
Love has her in an endless coma
Tear marked pillows
Broken china
Things they say that love is made of

Wet and strewn
She lies sedated
Wrenched with arms and legs akimbo
Locked up in her own asylum
Locked up in love's endless limbo

The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak
The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak

Locked up in her own asylum
Feeling so ashamed and crazy
Lets the other inmates touch her
Touch intimate places on her
Love has her in a sea of vitriol

Tear marked pillows
Broken china
Things they say that love is made of

The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak
The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak

Swollen tongued and swimming eyes
Smiles but never ever smiles
Can't sleep at night for endless wailing
Weeping, wailing, howling
Love's shuddering howl
Love's shuddering howl

The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak
The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak

If she can hoodwink the doctor
She'll get out for good behaviour
She'll get out for good

Marc Almond,"I've destroyed another love
Have to stamp out every good that touches me
In and out of my heart
Crawls the ugly worm of jealousy
Born from insecurity
Never meant to drive you away
I, guilty of all crimes
Saw myself in another light today

I who never
I who never

Outside in the sun hazed street
Is an empty parade of sinking hearts
Will I see your ragged head
Among those in search of one fast kiss
My searching heart joins those
Goes out to take your hand
You were once a part of this
My searching heart joins those
Goes out to take your hand
You were once a part of this

I who never
I who never

Sat sad by silent phone
Changed my number forgot to tell the world
Get drunk get dead and gone
You were such a special one to me
How can I with so much
Really have nothing at all
How can I with so much
Really have nothing at all

I who never
I who never

Desperate, irrational
Just another face another window
I would prowl the city streets
Searching for your signs
Fuelled by sweeter times

This could even make me pray

Marc Almond,"Every day I watch my mirror
Getting a little older, wiser, sadder with the years
Missed chances
Forgotten romances
Starting now to loosen with the tears
I could fall in love
Any time, any place, any where
But I spent last night
Treading on valentines
Treading on valentines
You know it didn't mean a thing
I didn't make me give two damns
You know I thought I'd never fall in love
It only worked in films
Response, responsibilities, bravery, hardship
Giving up and giving too
Here's little things I think I mean
Some consequence to you
I'll never get the chance again
Faces heartbreakingly wonderful
All flash by me
Steaming neon's in the rain
Diamonds down the memory drain
But you inspire me, fuel and fire me
Never leave me
Or deceive me
We could sit out winter evenings
Laughing over Love and Little White Lies
Sit out winter evenings
Laughing over Love and Little White Lies

Bitter coffee
Stomach aching
Pass the time while our hearts are breaking
I've got faith in you
So don't you have faith in me?
Misted mornings
Damp in sorrow
Love me just the same tomorrow
Something blue and something borrowed
And a bruise inside of me

I'm drunk on your delivery
Intoxicated by your eyes
Got to find an antidote
Before we say goodbye
Car wrecks and romantic moons
With you and I the stars
We're somewhere in a midnight movie
Somewhere off afar

There's no ice cream in the interval
No sweets or cigarettes
Just you and I
And a cast of thousands
Trying to forget
We could sit singing songs for suckers
Blacked out with  hymns of pain and sorrow
Oh kiss me once before you go
I may be dust tomorrow

Every day I watch my mirror
Getting a little older, wiser, sadder with the years
Missed chances
Forgotten romances
Starting now to loosen with the tears
My heart is pulsing brilliant red

And you know red's a colour for sin and danger
Ready now to take my chance
With any handy stranger
People will always
Love and Love and Love and Love and Love
But what the hell
We fool each other
When we've suffered through enough
But you inspire me
Fuel and fire me
Never leave me
Or deceive me
We could sit out winter evenings
Laughing over Love and Little White Lies
Sit out winter evenings

Oh can't you feel my heart

Marc Almond,"You cried last night in your sleep
Close my arms 'round you when you weep
Archangel on wings of the night
Keeps you safe 'til the kiss of the light
The hour is dark before the dawn
And so the lull before the storm
A world full of people alone
But I found a love of my own

My candle burns at both ends
It will not last the night
But ah my foes and oh my friends
It gives a lovely light

Soft voices whispering to me
From the sad heaving breast of the sea
As I stand in a pale light again
A moth clinging desperately to his flame
The hour is dark before the dawn
And so the lull before the storm
A world full of people alone
I cling to a flame of my own

My candle burns at both ends
It will not last the night
But ah my foes and oh my friends

Marc Almond,"You, unbelievably small
Bang your hands on the wall
Say ""To Hell with them all""
Say ""To Heaven with you""

Me, what will become of me?
Wading into the sea
Water way past my knees
Swallowing oceans is my speciality

You, like a trembling bird
Hanging on to each word
Crawling out of my sight
Oh how spite makes might

Me, crass stupidity's pawn
Kept us shouting till dawn
Old memories torn
Wishing I'd never been born
(You're losing it, losing it, losing it)

And you, Jack of Diamonds maybe
But the Ace ever me
With each turn of the card
Ever hardening heart

Me, smiling one moment
Crying the next
Building up to explosions
That leave me shipwrecked

You, stubborn brazen and wild
Unpredictable child
Emotional blackmail
Always destined to fail
(You're a failure in love, you're a failure in love)

Me, saying things I regret
I don't want to stop yet
Got to make you break down
Got to make you break uncontrollably down

You, rhinoceros skin
Never, never give in
Never, never giving
Hurts so to see me win
(You're always unforgivably stubborn)

Me, yes a cancer you tell
With the softest of shells
Always ending the same
Taking all of the blame
I'm taking all of the blame

This is the last time)

Marc Almond,"First I saw you
Love in a silk black slip
In dark waters
Sinking like a ship
Trouble on your lips
Murder in your song
Song of a mean man
Lovers come and gone

Oh Melancholy Rose
Oh Melancholy Rose

Come souls' midnight
We'll both sail away
Leaving red sunsets
To end our passion play
Bitter allows
Tingles on the tongue
Body and soul
Lovers come and gone

Oh Melancholy Rose
Oh Melancholy Rose

Always running away
Black Sobraine hair
Turning cigarette ash grey
Sprawled across troubled beds
Hands outstretched
Reaching for the pills
In lonely rundown motels
Life, love, men
Dust to dust
Disaster after disaster
Must be some dark kiss on your lips
A promise of heaven or hell in your song
Tomorrow it'll all be gone be gone

Oh Melancholy Rose
Love has come and gone
Oh Melancholy Rose

Marc Almond,"Well now I've been on my own for many a year
Seems like I'll never get loved
Got me a hand on this brother of mine
And I'm gonna get me the rub

Put Bessie Smith on the wail
Bring me the five young daughters
And help my ship to set sail

Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her

When I'm downtown in Barcelona
When I'm pissed or when I'm pissed off
Mother Fist just gives me her tender kiss
And some of her sexy stuff
And I lock my door from the inside
Turn my mind to sweet sweet pain
And I wail just like Yma Sumac

In confinement solitary
A soldier lost in the legion
Or a sailor out on the sea
A beggar, thief or a rich man
A gunman mercenary
A one legged crook
An Armenian cook

Marc Almond,"Well it seems you have a heart
I saw it once so I know it's true
You let it out on Sundays when
You let it beat me black and blue
When you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It was the most precious gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Well it seems you have a soul
You let it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It keeps me warm when I'm feeling sad and blue
Well you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
I wrapped it up in a bouquet of barbed wire
It was the wickedest gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Oh just like Johnny Rio baby
I need to be desired
I give up looking for my past
For the ones I left behind

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

It was the most precious jewel
I could give to you
Colour me red when I'm feeling blue
The colour of a kiss
In a young girl's dream
The mark of a guillotine
A drop of blood from a single thorn
Red wet sheets in the afternoon
A red light leading to my tomb
Ruby red all around my room

Ruby, ruby red
Oh shine a light onto this boy's bed
Oh, ruby, ruby, ruby red",Ruby Red
Marc Almond,"Once in a night
I spent in Istanbul
I had a dream of a forbidden world
Where even angels
Fear to look upon
A place where all of love is doomed to die
Her face appeared
Through clouds of bitter wine
Sour as the morning's early hours
She took my hair
And she curled it around
Her fingers
I was but a fool for love
The scent of Turkish oils
Mixed with the harsh tobacco
In the overcrowded bar
Hashish
And cool mint in her hair
I was a fool for love
I was a fool
She sang to me
A torch song softly laced
With mysteries Arabian
It poisoned my mind
A sickness in my soul
I tried
I didn't want to hear at all
A curtain fell
Before my eyes I did
Succumb into her healing breast
She sang that song
I gave her all my soul
And my all
To the pleasures of the flesh
I cried that night
For those forsaken times
Those times when I was
Simply satisfied
I turned to dust
That night a thousand times
That night a thousand times I died inside
And through what's left
Of my sad life I hear
Her singing in the fevers of the night
Look into the mirror of my eyes
And tell me what you see
It's not your love I need
You'll see
Sorrow, tears and darkness
These are the pleasures
Beyond your dreams
I found myself
Down by the sea
A hundred years ago
When I was in my teens
And years go by
I turned into a man
My childhood trapped within the sand
I crawled through life
On broken glass through hell
It seems I wakened my desires
And woke one day
Wet with the sweat of fear
Wet with the sweat of fear
As now with you
I'll reveal your mother
Come to me
I'll take you to the safety of the womb
Tell me your secrets
Sorrow tears and darkness
Pour out your heart
Sorrow tears and darkness
You'll be a fool
A fool for love
And hell had never seemed so good
As when I lost my soul
Became a fool for love
Help me, please to find my way
Look into the mirror of my eyes
Your kiss has clouded up my mind
And tell me what you see
I was a fool, a fool for love
It's not your love I need
I cried for those forsaken times
You'll see
She took my soul in Istanbul
Sorrow tears and darkness
She left me on that night to die
These are the pleasures beyond your dreams
These are the pleasures beyond all my dreams
I am lost
Help me to find my way
Here in a world where angels fear to gaze
My love is doomed to die
Alone tonight in Istanbul
And I a fool
For
Love

A little sweet

I like the mornings in the park
The summer heat

I got the smile
I got a box under the stars
Shoes on my feet

I got the joke
I got the twist
I got a lazy afternoon
I'm a man over the moon
Man of the world
Oh let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Chain me to a tree
Watch me
I'll set myself free
Escape from situations
Houdini would be proud of me
I'll lie around like Byron
And write verses to the moon
I'm the crime and I'm the siren
I'm a fighter in the ring of life
I've got the medals
I've got the scars
I've got a pocket full of hope
I got the beat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world
And the moon is in my head
The moon is in my head
The moon is in my head

Marc Almond,"He brings me flowers every morning
He brings the world onto my bed
He makes my bedroom into spring time
Violets, gardenias, roses red
He brings me tea and serves me chocolate
And I lick honey from his finger tips
He makes the world a little brighter
He makes my shadows a little lighter
I know where she keeps her money
I know she has but little time
I know that she completely trusts me
I've got her where I want her
She's completely mine
I've seen her brooches thick with diamond
I've seen her count her beads of jet and pearl
I'll bleed her of her soul and riches
I'm so happy that
Oblivious the bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart
Kept boy
I kept you encaptured
Kept boy
You keep playing the part
He cooks me dinner with the trimmings
He polishes my silverware
With tears of joy my eyes are brimming
Without him my world would be very bare
I know where she keeps her papers
Her testaments, her deeds to own the house
Her trusting look keeps me in stitches
I'm so happy that
Oblivious the bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart

I kept you encaptured

Keep playing the part
Kept boy

Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart
Kept boy
I kept you encaptured
Kept boy
Keep playing the part
He brings me flowers every morning
He brings the papers to my bed
Opens the curtains to my bedroom
And chases bad dreams from my head
And as we celebrate your birthday
The one you thought would be my last
There's something bitter in the champagne
Something working very fast
Oh, oh, how I'm, how I'm feeling very dizzy
The ceilings, the ceilings are becoming roundabouts
I caught your eyes upon my riches
Not so oblivious this bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
No more playing a part

I'll keep you forever
And ever (x10)
Kept boy
I'll keep you forever
And ever (repeat to fade)

Your hour has come
And you know those that God loves
Die young

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment

You're thinking too much about
Who will think badly of you
You throw away chances
Let love pass you by

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment

Don't be afraid of the dark of the night
Just reach for your feelings
Let your mood tell you
You're making the right moves

The days fade away
And before you can say
I wish I'd made all the right moves
It's too late

With guilt on your shoulder
With fear in your heart
You're bedeviled by angels
Belittled by fools

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever

Marc Almond,"Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile and making me frown

In a world that was small
I once lived in a time that was peace
With no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling unknown shook my heart
Made me want you to stay
All of my nights and all of my days

Yeah I gotta tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah something has invaded my nights
Painting my sleep with a color so bright
Changing the grey, changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you

I've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing, woah yeah

Every hour, yeah, every day, yeah

You touch me and my mind goes astray
And baby yeah",Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart
Marc Almond,"Do you remember those hazy amber days?
We were but children having the time of our lives
We had no regard or respect and a floor was a bed
And a bed held the mysteries of life

They had to end but so soon
And to sit in the dark of my lonely room
Made it all seem so cruelly real

Say no goodbyes, no regrets
For the things that we said and how we said
That we only wanted an answer to our dreams
We wanted an answer to our dreams

Ignorance is bliss
When adulthood we can't resist
To embrace the years with grace
What a waste, what a waste

The fun we had, the fun we'll have
Reckless immaturity

Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me
Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me

Growing older
Who needs someone to love him
Through life's winter
When the weather grows a little colder

I know I have a darker side

Your master of illusion

A secret or a little lie to test you
A song a verse a lullaby
A symphony once in a while
To try and impress you
I'll take your heart to the limit
The colors of my joy
My tears to dress you
But sometimes dear

I'm knee deep in fallen women
Being alone in the scarlet city
Can be tough
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
I'd give you anything you asked
Just for a second of your time
I could be your guardian angel
When it comes to pleasure
I could be your guide
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
Well I've seen the sights of New York
I've seen day become night
I've seen the Brooklyn Bridge
All covered in lights
I've dived to the depths
I've scaled the heights
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
I've had it all
But I'll give you the most valuable thing in the world
I'll give you my very last pearl
I'll give you the most magical thing in the world
I'll give you my very last pearl
For this could be the magic
This could be the magic
This could be the magic
The very last pearl
Make a wish on the
Very last pearl in the world
The very last pearl
Somewhere deep in the scarlet city
Waits the key to all my dreams
You're the cure for someone jaded
Someone jaded, someone just like me it seems
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
I want to be your angel
I want to be your angel
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
I've seen a Mediterranean night
The ships on the sea
The most beautiful eyes in the world
And the saddest eyes in the world
Call me romantic
Call me deluded
But I didn't care at all
But I'll give you the most valuable thing in the world
I'll give you my very last pearl
I'll give you the most magical thing in the world
I'll give you my very last pearl
",The Very Last Pearl
Marc Almond,"You make a fire
Here in my heart
Your kisses burn me
Sending sparks
Auras fade
Charisma pales
Your kisses burn
They scorch my soul
And world without end
Through tempest and storm
Your kisses my fire
Your love keeps me warm
When your kisses burn
Why are my lips like ice?
I'll make a fire
There in your heart
Made not of love
But only hate
And for the fuel
Will be your soul
An inferno
To consume you whole
And world without end
Through tempest and storm
My soul be your fire
To keep my heart warm
With my touch
I'll freeze your heart
Your kisses burn
The tides will turn
You brand your promise
On my tongue
I'll kill you
With this final fire
And lead you to
Your funeral pyre
And world without end
Through tempest and storm
My soul be your fire
To keep your/my heart warm
I will take your very soul
Your kisses my fire
Your love keeps me warm
Your kisses my fire
Your love keeps me warm
I will take your very soul
",Your Kisses Burn
Marc Almond,"We find love, you and I
It's a new game to play
Then we tell our first lie
And see a love go away

And we find
We're alone

We rush on, you and I
We don't need love at all
We need thrills, we need speed
And we stumble and fall

And we find
We're alone

We're loyal, you and I
To flowers that are dead
We forget how to cry
And save photos instead

And we find
We're alone

We hear guns, you and I
And we ask what is that
Then we open The Times
We're informed where it's at

And we find
We're alone

We're moral you and I
We stand for what's right
We slaughter our evil bygones

And in life
We find we're alone

We're lucky, you and I
We're alive and secure
But in the bank and the church
We can never be sure

And we find
We're alone

We've made it, you and I
We have glory and fame
But we never know why
We feel so ashamed

And we find
We're alone

We've power, you and I
But what good is that now?
We'd build a new world
If we only knew how

And we find
We're alone

We are old you and I
We beg warmth from the sun
In the dreams that we dream
We ask, ""What have we done?""

And we find
We're alone",Alone
Marc Almond,"You've understood nothing
If you need trains to fleet to adventure
And white ships to take you away
To see the sun in your eyes
To see the songs you can't sing

Then
If you don't believe in tomorrow
And tomorrow to be able to hope
To find again in the hope
That slipped from your hand
To find again the hand
That your hand has left

Then
If you need words pronounced by the old
To help you justify all your renunciations
If poetry to you is no more than a game
If all your life is only a growing old

Then
If you need boredom
To help you see the found
And the noise of town
To satiate remorse
And then weakness
To help you seem good
And then anger
To help you seem strong

Then, then
You've understood nothing
Nothing......nothing
You've understood nothing",If You Need

A patient girl who knows the score
Whistle for her
And the passing time
My death waits like a desperate truth
At the funeral of my youth
We pray for that
And the passing time

My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as all love is bright
Who loves for us
Amd the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
You know, there's nothing left to do
Angel or devil, Idon't care
For in front of that door
There is you

My death waits beneath my pillow
To catch my sleep in endless tableau
So lets freeze
The passing time

My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's drink to that
And the passing time

My death waits in your arms
Your thighs
Your soothing fingers will
Close my eyes
But let's not talk about
The passing time

But whatever is behind the door
And whoever waits for me
Angel or devil
I don't care
For in front of that door
You will be

My death waits among the fallen leaves
At my coffin where they greive
And now lets nail the passing time

My death waits among the rows
Where the blackest shadow goes
Let's cast blooms upon the passing time

My death waits in a double bed
Sands of oblivion at my head
Pull up the sheets against
The passing time

But whatever is behind the door
You know there's nothing much to do
Angel or devil
I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you",My Death
Marc Almond,"Behind the dirt
Sprawled before us
Behind narrow eyes
And faces of fat
Beyond those hands
Opened or closed
That strain in vain
Nor raise their fists
Further than frontiers
That barb our path
Further than misery
We must look

We must look at
What is beauty
The grey sky or blue
The women by the stream
The faithful friend
Tomorrow's sun
The fly to the swallow
The boat that returns
The faithful friend
Tomorrow's sun
The fly to the swallow
The boat that returns

Beyond the concert
Of sobbs and tears
Of cries of anger
Of men in fear
Beyond the din of
Streets and singers
Of warning sirens
Of swearing porters
Stronger than children
Who recount the wars
And stronger than
The great who've made us make them

We must listen to
The bird in the wood
The murmur of summer
The rising of blood
The mother soft songs
The children's prayer
And the noise of the earth
Gently falling to sleep
The mother soft songs
The children's prayer
And the noise of the earth
Gently falling to sleep

We must look",We Must Look
Marc Almond,"Desire...love...mystery...magic

Just close your eyes
Imagine you're in a place
Where you can taste all you crave
In life's masquerade

Come hold my hand
And all your wishes come true
Burlesque and blue
The carnival's calling to you

Your peace of mind
Will come in time
You'll understand all you'll see
Though it all seems
Like one of your dreams
It's a reality

We're drunk on life
We're drunk on life
Desire, love, mystery and magic

Desire...love...mystery...magic

Just close your eyes
You'll find yourself in a place
Your heart will race
No time for sorrow or tears

Riding a horse
On a merry-go-round
Colour and sound
Surround you to brighten the years

Janvier, fevrier, mars, avril, mai
Make way for June and July
August, September, October to wave
Novembre, decembre goodbye

We're drunk on life
We're drunk on life
Desire, love, mystery and magic
In a carnival of life
In a carnival of life
Desire, love, mystery and magic

Desire...love...mystery...magic
Desire...love...mystery...magic

Eros awake
Our hearts to take
Ready to break every law
I find I'm no longer
Chasing my youth
The truth is that I'm chasing yours

We're drunk on life
We're drunk on life
Desire, love, mystery and magic
In a carnival of life
In a carnival of life
Desire, love, mystery and magic
And magic...
",Carnival of Life
Marc Almond,"On Monday I took a flower
Dried it in my hand
Covered it in poison
And I threw it on the land
On wasted ground it tried to root
But choked upon the sand

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Tuesday I took a bird
Such pain to hear it sing
I blackened it with petrol
And oiled it's little wings
I tainted the breeze
As I threw it to the wind

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Wednesday I took a man
He begged please help me die
For he lay in pain and suffering
It made his loved ones cry
I can be terrible and gentle
In the blinking of an eye

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Thursday I took a woman
Heavy with a child
My old friend rape had paid a visit
Had stayed a little while
In a back street I touched her
With a wire and a smile

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Friday I took a city
Cursed it with a plague
Powdered crystals, smoking pipes
To crush and to enslave
And a row of dirty needles
Lines the route onto the grave

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Saturday I took a country
Praying for the rain
Parched throats and swollen lips
Without a harvest grain
And I wiped out generations
And I'd do it all again

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Sunday I took the world
A bomb I did employ
Seven days to create life
And one day to destroy
Every woman every man
Every girl and boy

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

Now as I close my diary
And I've made my final date
I blow away the ashes
And I stoke the smoking grate
I've no distinction between pain and joy
No line twixt love and hate

There's no room in my diary for you, my friend
There's no room in my diary for you

Marc Almond,"She's in my veins
Gold in my veins
She is my pain
And my joy
Time and again
Waxing or waning
I am insane
For La Luna
Madame de la Luna
When she is sleepy
She's creepy, mysterious and wicked
When she is full
She is full of promise and joy
Beaming her smile
All the while
Across Heaven's horizons
Weaving her dreams
Into hearts of lonely boys
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
She'll bring out the killer
Bring out the lover
She loves a tyrant, a pirate, a dreamer, a crook and a liar
A joker, a trickster, romancer, a dancer and fool
Cold as the frost but in her heart is a fire
Hanging around the dark throat of the night like a jewel
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
Moon, moon, delirious moon
Alone in the blue
Like a silver balloon
Moon, moon, delirious moon
Dancing a waltz
To a lunatic's tune
Madame de la Luna
Bewitching is she
I cannot live without her
She's scattering stars
Dancing with Mars
Cheek to cheek
With La Luna
Cheek to cheek
With La Luna
Madame de la Luna
She sings as she brings in the harvest
She pulls out her tongue
At the cruel Ethiopian sun
When she's hiding
The dark can bring a terrible vengeance
A pounce in the shadows
A moment alone with a gun
Adrift on a sea of indigo silk
Passionate like an Arabian torch
Enticing two lovers to jump off a bridge
Changing the man into the wolf
Sometimes she's a terrible flirt
Causing mischief and mayhem wherever she can
Sometimes she's a woman that hurts
Sometimes she is a man
Encouraging drunks to sing coarse serenades
Lighting the way for the young renegades
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
She says better times are gonna come soon
Better times are gonna come soon
Trust in the moon
Trust in the moon
La Luna",Madame de la Luna
Marc Almond,"I remember the sea I remember
How I thought she would sing forever
Though her voice it became a whisper
But the sea still sings in her heart

To the furthest shores of alaska
From the bow of a floundering tanker
Her shores in eternal winter
But the sea still sings in her heart

She waits for the moment
So still and alone
On her shoreline a necklace of feather and bone
No laughter of children
Where nothing will grow
But the sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart

I remember the sea, I remember
How she rose in a terrible temper
On a stormy night in September
How the sea still sings in her heart

Taking back all her stolen treasure
Giving back all our waste with a pleasure
Hand in hand with a furious weather
How the sea still sings in her heart

No longer distraught and no longer alone
She took all our shorelines and made them her own
Drowned all the people asleep in their homes
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart

The mermaids were singing a warning
The mermen were teasing and taunting
The sirens a song that was haunting
Tearing each ship from it's mooring
And the sea shed her black coat of mourning

I remember the sea I remember
The stillness and calm of the water
And a song that went on forever
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart
",The Sea Still Sings
Marc Almond,"She draped herself in widow weeds
Veil of black and buttoned sleeves
Hid her face from the world
A shadow where once had been a girl

Her husband of past twenty years
Had passed away leaving her in tears
Heart full of the future's fears
She kneels beside his grave

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
""please stop your tears and throw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey""

Then she did wail a chilling sound
Beat her fists and hit the ground
She moaned his name, she pulled her hair
She chanted verse and muttered prayer
How could a man so just, so good
Leave her a widow like he could

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
""please stop your tears and throw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey""

And deep within chador of lace
The deep etched sorrow on her face
This madonna in her cowl of grief
Subservient in her belief

Then came the reading of the will
Grief had hold within her still
But unable to believe her ears
She stopped her sobbing, halted tears

Not a penny, not a pound
No provision to be found
Not a thought of recognition
The will was read with cold precision

Anger jumped up in her breast
Well maybe this was for the best
Even as the will was blessed
She tore away her veil

Tears of rage to tears of joy
No more grief from death's envoy
No more weeping, gnashing teeth
No more prostrate with grief

She thought he loved her
So sure he loved her
She thought he loved her
So sure he loved her

But all his treasure all his wealth
Just signify love for himself
Just signify love for himself

The chador fell unto the earth
Witness a woman's rebirth
Witness a woman's rebirth

She exorcised grief's ugly demon
With a new found sense of freedom

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, now she can say
She stopped her tears and threw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey
",Widow Weeds
Marc Almond,"And if one day I should become
A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you

My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return

I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree

And no pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
I'd sing that song they sang to me
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I could have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows

My name would then be Handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whiskey that came from Twickenham
Authentic queens and phoney virgins

I'd have a bank on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I wanna be

Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
And I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

Now tell me, wouldn't it be nice
That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there?
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
'Cause down below is really nowhere

My name would then be Jupiter
Then I would know where I was going
Become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing

If I could play deaf, dumb and blind
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night

When my angelic work was through
The Angels and the Devil too
Could sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way",Jacky [Single Mix]
Marc Almond,"When I was seventeen
I was chasing after dreams
In southport
I had to get away
Or end up in a nursing home alone
When I was seventeen
I had a special love
And southport
Didn't seem a bad place after all

On the promenade
The carnival facade is peeling
And the floral clock
Has stopped a moment caught in time
Such a sad decay
Well, it's something like the way I'm feeling
For such a dream so big
Southport seemed a little bit too small

And I was still naive
I really did believe in magic
Thought I had found a love
And treasured it above all else
But then I looked beyond
I saw another life was waiting
I was chasing after dreams
I had to find them by myself

I hope you understand
Such a love could never be
The sea has turned my soul
And it aches to be free
I will always think
Of southport at the fair
Summer on the beach
The fun that we had there

With southport in my mind
But las vegas in my heart
I set out to search for the stars
But every dream I dream
Follows where you've been
And it's tearing my heart apart

When I was seventeen
I left to find my dream
From southport
January came
I blame myself for out goodbyes
Nothing is so sad
As the sea side out of season
And nothing is so sad
As you and I

When I was seventeen
I was chasing after dreams
In southport
I had to get away
Or end up in a nursing home alone
And now it seems I'd never been
A boy of seventeen
In southport
It didn't last
A lifetime passed
A love outgrown

Was it all a dream
Or was it all for real
I'm standing on the pier
I'm trying not to feel
The tears are in my eyes
Your face is in the sand
I'm trying to look down
I'm reaching out my hand
I'm falling to the wind
I'm waiting for the sea
But the sea is never in
It's never in for me
In southport
(it's never in for me)
(repeat and fade)

Marc Almond,"Night and no morning
Day and no dawning
And the tears that keep falling
Over me
Dream with no ending
Darkness descending
And the years that keep calling
Out to me

And soon comes the morning sun
Exposing my desires
And then my heart will die
My eyes will burn as I start to cry
Eyes that seem only to weep
Eyes that reveal a fear
Where should be only sleep
A fear tomorrow may find me here
I push my tired body on
In keeping the dawn at bay
Afraid of what I`ve become
Afraid of another day
And soft is the rain on my face
Lady Night weaves her magic spell
Hiding that which I fear
The face I knew only so well

Night and no morning
Day and no dawning
And the tears that keep falling
Over me
Endlessly searching 
My hunger returning
Loneliness burning
Into me

If I believed in God
I`d pray for the dawn to stay away
For as the dawn awakes
This light will flicker, flicker and die
Eyes that are hungry as mine
Eyes that are desperate as mine
We look and we recognise
Both seeing something we despise

My eyes have seen tomorrow
My eyes have seen the truth
The all revealing eyes
Eyes that once burned, burned with youth
Eyes will reveal what is true
Eyes that look deep, deep in mine
Eyes that belonged to someone I love
Those eyes belong to someone like you",Night and No Morning
Marc Almond,"Love
Is a beautiful brutal thing
It sings at night like the wind
It stings your heart like a whip
It rocks your soul like a ship
And love
Is a beautiful brutal thing
It can mean everything
Or nothing at all
Such a feeling can make you tall
Or as small as a distant star
It's the cushion to break your fall
Love triumphs over all
Love
Is a beautiful brutal thing
And it gives the sweetest of pain
It wakes your spirit and then
You feel like living again
And rain
Falls when you think the Sun
Has just begun
To shine above
And love
Is mysterious as it's old
It's the secret you've never told
It's the tears of sorrow and joy
For that girl or that boy
It makes you feel
It makes you feel
It makes you feel
A beautiful brutal thing
And love
Is a beautiful brutal thing
It can mean everything
Or nothing at all
Such a feeling could make you tall
Or as small as a distant star
It's the cushion to break your fall
Love triumphs over all
It makes you feel

",Beautiful Brutal Thing
Marc Almond,"Sometimes we touch
Sometimes we kiss
Sometimes we just look
In spiritual bliss
In warmth or heat
In sound or vision
We like to come
To some decision
Under the moon
In the dark
Down in the street
In the park

In sweat of fear
I'd risk it all
To have you near
I've never seen your face
But I'm longing for the time
When we don't have to hide
Anymore
We'd swap phone numbers
But we'd never call
Of real excuses
We've none at all
Though good intentions
Are on our mind
We may not like
What we might find
We hold emotion
Well in check
No words of love
Just words of sex
So much to say
So much held back
We don't surrender
We just attack
I've never seen your face
But I'm longing for the time
When we don't have to hide
Anymore
Light the candle
Burn a fuse
It's now or never
Win or lose
To have and hold
To give and take
Through thick or thin
Make or break
I've never seen your face
But I'm longing for the time
When we don't have to hide

Marc Almond,"I've had my fill of ugly words
I've had my fill of lies
When the only truth or beauty now
Is deep within your thighs
The roses are in bloom my dear
I haven't any fear
That you'll love me
Like you did last year
Look at me
Do you see
A man against the world
But don't look at me
And see an unhappy man
With some powder and some paint
And the patience of a saint
I'm still here
My life's not over yet
I'm not up there on the shelf
I've found someone to love
Apart from just myself
I've had my fill of bitterness
I've had my fill of dirt
I've had enough of emptiness
I've had enough of hurt
I think we'll get the last laugh
If we don't break down and cry
And find the joke's
On you and I
Look at us
Do you see us in a burlesque show
Look at us are we in vaudeville
We've tasted every thrill
Every powder every pill
And we're still here
I've had enough of broken cups
I've had enough of scenes
Of other people's laughter
When we go through our routines
The lilies aren't in season
So I've no reason to fear
That you'll love me like you
Did last year
That you'll love me like you
Did last year
That you'll love me like you
Did last year

Crying in the rain
It was a kind of so so love
And I'm going to make sure it never
Happens again
You and I
It had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were a sleep around
A lost and found
And not for me I fear

I tried to make it work
You in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit
(Well it just wasn't me)
You're used to wearing less
And now your life's a mess
So insecure you see
I put up with all the scenes
And this is one scene
That's going to be played my way

Take a look at my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me

Under the deep red light
I can see the makeup sliding down
Hey little girl you will always make up
So take off that unbecoming frown
What about me- well
I'll find someone
That's not going cheap in the sales
A nice little housewife
Who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails

Take a look at my face
For the last time

For quite a while now
And to keep you secret has been hell

Marc Almond,"There is a bed where I can end my days
To think about the road I've run the miles I've come
There is a bed where troubles melt away
My lonely hours or hours with you
The times that we've come through

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away
There is a bed that is my sanctuary
A bed where I can end my days

There is a bed",There Is a Bed

It doesn't matter anyway
Don't hide the photos

I'm quite sure we've both seen funnier sites

Beauty is skin deep

Youth has gone
We're still young
It's hard I know to believe
That I was somebody's son

The memories of what we both were

Youth sleeps in a deep deep sleep
Beauty is skin deep

Youth has gone
And don't think I don't cry
We've let ourselves slip
And now I asked myself why
I'm on my own
And don't think I really mind

I've got to get away 
From the pain you drive jnto the heart of me. 
Fhe love we share seems to go nowhere 

And I've lost my light for I toss and turn - I can't sleep at night. 

Once I ran to you 
Now I'll run from you 

This tainted love you've given - 
I give you all a boy could give you. 
Take my tears and that's not living - oh

Now I know I've got to run away 
I've got to get away. 
You don't really want it any more from me - 
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight

Sprawled across a black piano
Hollerin' the blues
Morally low and dying slow
What a way to go go go

It's the little surprises I like in life
You know, like the way when you treat me nice
Love that's as rough as morning mouth
Open up the stitches let it all fall out

Love the lie we're living

For playing and forgiving
Broken bracelets, broken dates
And half a bottle of heartache

Knocking me off of the windowsill

Marc Almond,"The one who has me for his own
Is on the town and not alone
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slams the door without goodbye
Tonight my eyes are jealous green
Tonight I'm melancholy mean
He meets in secret rendezvous
Some dame to tell his troubles to
The heel

He'll promise her most anything
A sable coat, a diamond ring
She'll find him out when it's too late
And all she'll get will be the date
But while the dawn's a distant thing
In his embrace her heart will sing
A dizzy head will spin with lies
And all too late a woman cries
The heel

The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow
And in the gloom I hear a laugh
It's coming from his photograph
I wring my hands and mop the floor
And swear to even up the score
But where a kitten cried tonight
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel

I dare not play my radio
One more complaint and out I go
I'm sick of playing solitaire
The ace of spades is everywhere
There'll be no sleep for me tonight
The sheep I count are never white
They all turn out to be jet black
And who's the leader of the pack
The heel

At dawn I know he'll stagger in
Demanding coffee black as sin
And as I take it from the tin
I'll slip a little powder in
He'll look at me and start to cry
And cross his heart and hope to die
And mumble I know how you feel
But I've been on a business deal
The heel

Then as the pot begins to perc
I know my plan will never work
When he starts to drink it up
I grab his hand and break the cup
It's only jealousy I know
That brought my thinking down so low
Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave?
The heel

But now he's reeling on the stair
I'll try to act like I don't care
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click
We're in a web of love and hate
Where it will end is up to fate
I'll let him have his little flings
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel",Heel

Sluggish city daylight in the afternoon
Here's that special silence
Just before you walk out of the hotel room
Each time we're so close I assume
That we'll never be again

A casual affair
Was all that you could spare
From your emotional change
A calendar of greetings
Strangers on the street
The best we've ever arranged

Now I just can't stand all the pain
All the constant break and mend
Oh, how long can we pretend
That we're just good friends?

I gave you my devotion
Hiding nothing up my sleeve
If I walked clean out of your life
Would you even notice me?
So much tangled up emotion
Should I stay or should I go?
If I walked clean out of your life
How long would it take you to know?
Are we such good friends?

And how sordid this has become
As the means approach the end
And how long can we pretend?

Marc Almond,"I went walking down by the river
Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried
He told me he was very lonesome
No one cared if he lived or died
He said sometimes the thunder and lightening
Make all the little clouds cry
He said, ""Have faith in all kinds of weather
Through the sun will always shine
Do your best and always remember
The dark clouds pass with time.""
He asked me if I would tell all my world
Just how hard those little clouds try
That's how I know I'll always remember
The little white cloud that sat right down and cried
",Little White Cloud That Cried
Marc Almond,"I've spent many a night
Lying on my back
Waiting for the dawn
To pierce and crack
And the ceiling
Hanging from the sky
And I envy the boy 
Who grabbed the toy
And ran away
And found a joy
While I stood in the shadows 
Wondering why

Flying towards me
Then he laughs
A woman's face
The terrible taste
Of the morning after kisses
And goodbyes
I could never seem to catch my footsteps
Have desires, they fly away
Every day I have to fight the plague

How can I sleep in hours like this
When anguish tracks me like a fist
My nakedness exposed, I can't stand
Still I...try to remember lips on lips
Hips on hips and ice on fire
In gloom and glow 
When did they leave the man

In the mirror of the night I see
A face that staring out at me
Like a fallen star
Burned itself out
Like a deadly scrapes 
Across the ground
My voice cried out
In a gravelled sound
No one's there to hear me
But the plague

Straining hard to see
Running after me
I keep pounding pounding on the door
But it's all so vague
When you meet the plague
And I keep coming
I keep coming back for more ",Plague

Explore the ship
Replace the cook
Let no one leave alive
Across the straits
Around the Horn
How far can sailors fly
The twisted path
Our tortured course
And no left alive
We sailed for parts
Unknown to man
Where ships come home to die
No lofty peak
No fortress bold
Could match our captain's eye
Upon the seventh
Seasick day
We made our port of call
The sun so white
And the sea so blue
No mortal place at all
We fired the gun
And burned the mast
And rode from ship to shore

We sailors wept
But our tears were tears of joy
How many moons
And how many Junes
Have passed since we made love

And a seaman's log

Where we can climb up to the stars

It just takes a little money
And we'll get there by and by
For I've got a little more
Than any other girl
You pay a little extra
For a trip around the world
And if the world is not enough
Then I'll take you to the sky
Put you in an armhold
Blacken both your eyes
For you'll find no other woman
That will love you like I do
I'll just open up the oven door
And leave the cooking up to you

And she took me to her room
That had never seen the light
Those sheets had seen a legion
And she beat me up all night

Her lips a gash of lipstick
And she sucks a cigarette

A cowardly boy
Adventure only dreams

A captain of
A pirate ship
A million crimson themes

I wish to be
Content you see
To take the softer seat

To summon gut
To play the slut
My bass drum for to beat

Hey!

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor in my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

But it happened that
There came a ghost
To visit on my soul

I coloured him
From picture books
With eyes as rich as gold

A ghost who would
Embody
All my sickly frame would be

A hero
And a challenger
Of heart and spirit free

Hey!

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

And gyp the blood
And I retook
The world upon our backs

And we drank from dawn
To dusk
How the warm breeze took our drags

For we had the reins
On europe we
Had our anger like a flame

The balls to fight
The system
And the nerve to win the game

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

So purity
I would spit upon
All saintly sights be damned

For it seems correct
To kill and steal
To be a proper man

I find myself
Full up with hate
To lose it on the world

An eye for deeds
Of darker shade
And a lip so wickedly curled

A skull encrusted
Captains hat
Fell down upon my brow

I gathered all
My hopes and schemes
All wisdom for to know

And rip the shirts
I wore around
My shoulders like a robe

Dark ermine trim
And tainted grin
Grim warnings to forbode

And all the love within me
Would be churned for something sour
My angels tongue ripped from my throat
And tortured by the hour

For I have no time to learn
For love wounds me with it's touch
May the gods take me a screaming
May the gods take me a screaming...

Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze

And I'm scrubbing these floors while you're gawking
Maybe once you tip me and it makes you feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this pit of hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talking
No
You'll never guess to who you're talking

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you wonder: ""who could that have been ? ""
And you see me kind of grinning while I'm scrubbing
And you say ""what she got to grin ? ""

With a skull on it's mast-head
Will be coming in

What's wrong with you ? earn your keep here""
You toss me your tips and look to the ships
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here tonight

And you see me kinda staring out the window
And you say: ""what she got to stare at now ? ""

There's a ship

Turns around in the harbour
Shooting guns from her bow

Well you gentlemen can wipe those smiles off your face
'cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frigging place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up, safe and sound
And you yell: ""why do they spare that one ?
""why?
""why the hell do they spare that one ? ""

All the night through with the noise and to do
And you wonder: ""who is that person that lives up there ? ""
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking fine with a ribbon in my hair
Well just look at me now
And a ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up it's mast-head
And a cheer rings the air. hey!

My ? ? ? on the dock is a swarming with men
Coming out from the ghostly freighter
They're moving in the shadows where no-one can see
And they're chaining up people
And delivering 'em to me
Asking me: ""kill them now or later ? ""
Asking me: ""kill them now or later ? ""

Noon by the clock and so still at the dock
You can hear a fog horn miles away
And in that quiet of death I'll say:
""right now !""
""right now !""
And they pile up the bodies
And I'll say: ""that'll learn you.
That'll learn you.""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And

You came from the Burma Lagoon.
You said, ""Would you like a bit of travel?""
You promised me all but the moon.
I asked you what you did for a living.
And you swore, God's my witness, to me.
That you worked for the railroad people,
And would never ever follow the sea.

You said a lot, Johnny.
Not a word was true, Johnny.
You betrayed me, Johnny

As long as I pleased you at night.
But only a few weeks later,
Not a thing I did was right.
Up and down we tramped through the Punjab,
The river along to the sea.
But now when I look in the mirror,
There's a broken face that I see.

You wanted no love, Johnny.
You wanted the loot, Johnny.
But your lips, Johnny,
I could never forget.
You asked for everything, Johnny,

Why did treat me so bad?

And I do love you so.

I wish I had paid more attention
To that nickname of yours and the rest.
All along that bloody awful coastline,
You have been a notorious guest.
In a sixpence-a-night bed one morning,
I will wake to the thunder of the sea.
And your ship will be leaving the harbor,
And you won't even wave to me.

You have no heart, Johnny!
You're a bastard, Johnny!
Why did you leave me?
Can you tell me that?
I love you more, Johnny,
Than the first night, Johnny.

A fish from the China Sea
At times one sees it crossing
Diminished in his eyes

He washed his hands and was still

A hundred stars and his ship
He saw the balconies of the pope
And the golden breasts of the Cuban girls

Giving me aches with pathetic opinion
People, it's fact, are insufferable turds

Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

And I can't bear the little creeps
That tell me they hate my hair
They're always incredibly ugly
If they dropped dead tomorrow I wouldn't care
They feel that they have to comment
Have to put up with their penneth-worth
They're sick, hypocritical, mincing, unwitty
Not worth a spit in the dirt

They're not worth a spit in the dirt
They're not worth a spit in the dirt

Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

There's trouble going on
Behind your eyes
Blue little eyes
Where trouble lies
They gave you too much trouble
But not enough time
The time starts here
And here you'll find
I want to be inside
Be inside your mind
Riding where your secrets hide
And worship at the shrine
It's time to be adored and explored
So you wanna be adored and explored
And you're gonna be adored and explored
So come on and be adored and explored
There's a storm coming up behind your eyes
You're gonna give the world a big surprise

So you wanna be adored and explored
And you're gonna be adored and explored
So come on and be adored and explored
No more tears
For downtrodden years
You're an undiscovered land
Unexplored by man
Open your mind
Leave it all behind
Its all there to find
In a too bright mind
Unconventional child
You ran too wild
Now its written in the sky
You'll emerge as the butterfly
As the butterfly
So you wanna be adored and explored
And you're gonna be adored and explored
Yeah, it's time to be adored and explored
So come on and be adored and explored

Look around and I can see
A thousand people just like me.

Give yourself to the heat
Sacrifice yourself to the beat
The rhythm of love
The beat of your heart
Don`t follow the rules
This love can be cruel

Come on now
Oh yeah!

The law of the night...
It`s the danger you love
The danger you feel
The fear is your fuel
Excitement is real
The joy of the ride
Your heart at the wheel
Is your mind in enough confusion?

Feeling so free
Is all that you know
Your hand on the gun
With no-one to know
And all your desires
Have nowhere to go
You`re in need of a love transfusion

Give yourself to the heat
Sacrifice yourself to the beat
The rhythm of love
The beat of your heart
Don`t follow the rules
This love can be cruel

And you`re lost in a passion of fire
As you climb between shadow and light
Just a slave to the rules of desire
You surrender to the law of the night

The law of the night
The law of the night
Is fueling you on
The flick of the knife
The draw of the gun
The thrill of the ride
While still on the run
No time to think of tomorrow

The glamor of violence
Deep in your soul
Your hand at the wheel
With nowhere to go
You`re taking a trip
You`re out of control
It`s time for a transformation

Marc Almond,"In the city of nights
In the city of nights

As the lights go on there`s a magic glow to the sea
But as we move through the streets we can feel the fear
As night goes on there`s a tragic show in the city
Those songs are on the ebb and mixed with tears

And down the alleyway the drunks are fighting
Over who will have the last drink from the can
It all seems so romantic in the lying
But what a sad existence for a man

There`s speeders, dealers, girls of easy virtue
Laughter, lies and lovers sparkling eyes
Glitter boys and girls out for the dancing
Good time girls and boys out for the highs

And there`s a hotel on hope street
Where the concierge will understand your needs
She doesn`t care your colour or religion
And she always has a room for you and me

In the city of nights
In the city of nights

There`s an oriental flavour in the city
Marta Haries, saris and sarongs
Incense candles, prayer and incantations
Golden girls Arabia in their song

It seems the doors are closed on the asylums
And in the street they`re putting on a show
Talking to themselves they get no answer
Or suggestions for a better place to go

In the city of nights
In the city of nights

A young man dreams of the open sea
In the year from no God knows where he`ll be
No open door to set him free
No open door to set him free

Girls sell kisses to the lonely men
Boys turn tricks with the sleight of hand
Women fear to walk where men desire
Inspiration, hope and fire

Hey don`t be a stranger
Make a friend don`t let it end you
Hey don`t be a stranger
There`s a light burning in the city
In the city
In the city of nights

As the sun goes down there`s a wind blowing through the city
A darker day as summer says goodbye
Another world is waking in the city
All live fears, important knowing eyes

And there amongst the litter and the debris
The sally army busking out a song
Drowning out the sound of breaking windows
Sing along, sing along, sing along

And after her dance
In a dressing room dusty and dirty
She squints in the mirror
And tells herself never again
She's pushing an age that hits on the wrong side of thirty
She pulls off her wig
But the stain of the make-up remains

Lives in a rented apartment
She's working all hours
To meet all the bills and demands
She's a girl with a difference
Or two in every department

With a wife and two kids on her hands

To escape from your hurt and your sorrow (sorrow)

You were always in a world of your own

You tried hard to capture them like little birds
You would keep them in cages forever and ever

Marc Almond,"On a dark night in a lost hour
In a town built from neon and chrome
Where las vegas seeks the desert
In an old broken down casino
There the gambler slapped his money down
Dirty dollars one hundred or more
Placed his last bet on a poker game
Crossed his heart for the winning score

But the players at the table
Two men of the phantom creed
Seemed to play with sombre purpose
Than a reason and pure greed
And the gambler felt his back freeze
And fear brushed his ageing brow
For he'd seen those men before in his dreams
Here they sat before him now

And the one smoothed back his black hair
With a comb slicked by brylcream and grease
Flipped the cards with a flippancy
Of a wily and slippery ease
With his sharp suit shade of lilac
On a shuffle he made the cards sing
Gold studs and menthol cigarettes
Rubies set in a skull ring

And the other of the clergy
With a colour and robe of pale ivory
Silver grey at the temples
And a smile that was stern and was kindly

Jack of hearts lead, wait for aces
Became faces of family and friends
Until the deck showed him a picture
Of his life from beginning to end
Reverend life he flipped an ace
And the gambler felt blood in his heart
For he knew this was the game of games
He would need all the reverend's heart

Anger, lust and gluttony
The gambler seems hit hard
Each failure and each feature
Mapped out in the slippery cards
Greasy mr.d. flashed a winning grin
And stood facing reverend life
The reverend paled as he saw the score
The gambler felt pain as a knife

His troubles, tribulations
Revelations and regrets
A wife, a child, a fight to trial
Turned by the hand of death
And the gambler saw his hand stained
With the blood of his family ties
And with the yellow smile of mr.d.
In his mind he crumples and dies

And these two great men from different worlds
Faced each other and shook of hands
The reverend shrugged ""ah well next time""
And departed for heaven's land

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble

Marc Almond,"I really must stop always being the child
Chasing his youth his heart, nose to the wind
I really must cure my tender nostalgia
Bury deep my stars beneath the veil of night
I must postpone my Spanish chòteau
Dreams that befuddle like an old wine
I must also give up those sunny states
To become a man
And when that day comes
You will forgive me, you won't be surprised
When I show my teeth, when I show my bite
Then I will be a man
And I will stand tall
I really must share my classes with others
So my youth can pass at last, so I forget
I really must scrape my nails on my heart
That my life hardens with sorrow and pain
I must upset my guardian angels
Who soothed me too much
And when that day comes
You won't be annoyed
If I scratch a bit, if I practice being....so savage!
You will forgive me, you won't be surprised
When I show my teeth, when I show my bite
Then I will be a man
And I will stand tall
And you will be prepared to find before you
Someone who's like you, a wolf among the wolves
Then I will be a man
And I will stand tall
And you will be prepared to find before you
Someone who's like you, I'll be a wolf among the wolves
Then I will be a man

Marc Almond,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease the candle flame
A thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me, me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
That never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay
For yesterday....when I was young, young, young,......young

Marc Almond,"This is my destiny
For one brief moment
And I'm not gonna let it die

I'm like the sun shining brightly
This is my destiny
For one brief moment
And I'm not gonna let it die

Marc Almond,"I don't mean to be bitter
But I'll hurt if you call
Telling me you landed on your feet, after all
Now your bedroom eyes are looking tired
My baby has your sparkle died
You smile
But all the while your heart
Hardens up
With a cry

You're good at living out a lie
You know you're giving out a lie
You're always living out a lie
You know you're giving out a lie

I kissed your mind
While on the run
Once more I've been too near the sun
You filled the role
And love was hot
I watch the tv
Weeping now
It numbs my passions
Sleeping now
Some opera shallow drama
Fills up my life
And I ask myself why

I'm good at living out a lie
You know I'm giving out a lie
I'm always living out a lie
You know I'm giving out a lie

The poison barely passed our lips
The words are threads
The truth that never should be said
Friends can go between
Each pouring fuel upon the fire
The spider weaves her web
Of honesty and lies
But I need the pain
To feel alive
A twisted reason
To survive
I'll say I hate you
And with all of my heart
I will try

Oh god
Its just another lie
Its just another lie
Its just another lie
Its just another lie


It wasn't always cruel like this
Our dreams were chiffon and cerise
But promises made off our heads
Were just like pissing in the wind

Marc Almond,"On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to show off for us
There is the sun, the sand, and the arena
There are the bulls ready to bleed for us

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Don Juan
And all the ugly girls
Turn into swans

Who can say what he's found
That bull who turns and paws the ground
And suddenly he sees himself all nude
Who can say what he dreams
That bull who hears the silent screams
From the open mouths of multitudes

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to suffer for us
There are the picadors and the mobs revenge
There are the toreros and the mob's revenge,
there are the toreros - and the mob kneels for us

It's time when grocery clerks
become Garcia-Lorca
And the girls put the roses in their teeth
Like Carmen

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to drop dead for us
The sword will plunge down
And the mob will drool
The blood will poor down
And turn the sand to mud

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Nero
And the girls scream
And shout the name of their hero

And when finally they fell
Did the bulls dream of a hell
Where men and worn out matadors
Still burn
And perhaps with their last breath
Would they pardon us their death
Knowing what we did at
Carthage, Waterloo, Verdon, Stalingrad, Iwoa Jima , Hiroshima, Saigon",The Bulls
Marc Almond,"Way back then I was a champion
A fighter in the ring
And all the crowds would cheer
My praises they would sing
Now I am a forgotten man
A hobo out alone
No champ to push me on
Nothing, no-one to call my own

I was a dark eyed boy
Stars in his eyes
Promises made flesh and blood
Grip of arm
And granite charm
Oh, times were golden
Times were good
Sinew young
And skin of ore
Molten and streaming with dreams
Now I nod away the days
Barely remembering names it seems

Oh, I would smile
To hear the bell
Ringing out my glory
Like a bull I paced the ring
My bloody territory

I held on high
The fist in glove
The symbol of my power
Now I wait
A punch drunk fool
To fade away forever

Broken noses
Broken jaws
And many broken hearts
An idol
And a hero
Till my courage fell apart
And now my brain a-ringing
With the final bell and count
They hold my hand up limply
Told the world
That I was OUT!
I didn't mind the scars
The blood
The crushing of the hand
But to lose a nation's
Love, respect
Is something I'll never understand

I'm gonna bury my head
And cry",The Champ
Marc Almond,"One day the devil came above ground
One day the devil came above ground
To study his interests
He saw everything
The devil, he heard everything
And having seen all
Having heard all
He returned to his home below
And down below
They organized a grand feast
At the end of this feast 
The devil rose to deliver his speech
This is the jist of what he said
Okay!
Okay
The world up there is like a sea 
Of raging fires that spit and roar
Okay
And man has fought like crazy
With dangerous games of war
Okay
Trains are derailed
A crash
His boys filled with ideals
Place bombs on the tracks
Well that creates original death
That death creates without confession
Confessions without remission
Okay
Nothing is sold 
But all is bought
Honour and sainthood
Okay
And states change secretly
Into anonymous societies
Okay hey hey
And the mighty extort their dollars
From countries that are poor
And Europe also rips the scars
With it's post colonial gorge
That creates death from starvation
And starvation of nations 
Okay
And man has seen so much of it
That his eyes have become grey
Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And no songs seem to exist
Except when sung on stage
Okay
They dispense with hired thugs
And jack-ass poets get the elbow
but in the papers everywhere

And laughter in dishonest ones

Marc Almond,"A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned

A passing phase, a week of love
But all at once you had enough
It pales so soon, waned with the moon
No deep concern for a lover spurned

She'll destroy you with her little games
See you swallow all the blame
Make you pay in many ways
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll tell her friends to treat you rough
That you just weren't good enough
Make the going really tough
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

And every day, more guilt to pay
A lesson learned from a lover spurned

It was all so cozy for you
You had a wife, two children
And a beautiful house
And me, well you wanted me

When it suited your needs
And now, now I have nothing
Just a handful of faded photographs
Nothing but a cold empty heart

But I'm not easily forgotten
I'll appear when you least expect
To make you pay
You asked for it that way

She'll come to get you with a knife
Write poison letters to your wife
Totally destroy your life
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll make a fool of you at work
Drag your name through the dirt
Make sure that it really hurts
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned
",A Lover Spurned
Marc Almond,"And he dances every night
Framed in candles
And white white light
All is revealed
When all is too bright
You're such a pleasure
A wonderful pain
Makes me never want
To love again
But sorrow always comes
To those with fickle fame

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

We are consumed by corruption
Old before our time
Hurt by others' hunger
Scarred by love as greed (how I need)
How cruel the birthday of 17
Youth behind you
The long years ahead
Showing you what you might have been
Instead of drifting, drifting, drifting

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

Foundations crumble
Walls subside
We all break apart
When there's heartache inside
Hold back those years
Those tears
With a futile pride (we're gonna come clean)
Beware of love
And of dark-eyed men
They're sweet and they're tender
But they have no hearts
Just long smashed
Cruel shards of broken glass

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

And all those songs
That made me cry
Keep flooding back
And years of new discovery and you
Disturbing my dreams
Now we're flowing down that river
Heading for the delta
I don't know which way to flow
But my heart's a forest fire
And yours a field of snow

I don't know which way to flow
Don't know which way
Don't know which way
To flow",The River
Marc Almond,"The sea says
Come with me and whisper
Run with me
And tell me
Why is it you're lonely

I held your hand
In those years as a child
Soothed all your fevers
Tousled your hair
Gave you my treasures
My shells and my shingle
Made you feel happy
When things seem so bad

The sea says
I gave you stories
Adventure and mystery
When all was not well
I sung you to sleep
Crept into the cracks
Of your imagination
Made you feel happy
When things seem so bad

The sea says
Please don't go to pieces
Things can't be so bad
Why looking so sad

Marc Almond,"There are many who have laid with me
Then got up and walked away from me
And played around with me like I was a game
Every night was a one night fling
When I'd given them everything
They never even asked me for my name
God they never even asked me for my name
Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it
So if you love me
The way I love you
Why can't we spend our lives as one
My reputation was all over town
As a woman who was passed around
I knew every wrong way to go
Seen every room with a bed inside it
And every habit I've tried, I tried it
But from now on I say hell no
No but from now on I say hell no
Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it
So if you love me
The way I love you
Why can't we spend our lives as one
Why can't we spend our lives as one

Marc Almond,"You kissed my grateful skin
And left a chain of bites and bruises

And wander through your rooms of silence

Your tongue is love
And your heart is violence

And fire is sixes
Vengeance feels nice
I know the shine
Behind your tricks is

Who would have thought
It would end like this
You gave a stranger
A dangerous kiss
Now your pretty eyes

As they fall

In a somnambulistic decay

Where did it go?
Gone to the land
Of satin and snow
Long gone

Marc Almond,"A winter morning sun in New York
Champagne wakes and checks the time
It's hard to keep a cup of coffee down
When there's so much on your mind

Kicks a cockroach 'cross the bedroom floor
Checks the mirror, grabs some clothes
Waits for the aching to subside
Where to find it? No one knows

And they say you're doing fine
They're just playing with your mind
And they never even know your name
But they all want you to shine, to glitter all the time
They all want a little taste of Champagne

Takes the subway, early afternoon
Downtown to Eighth Avenue to the Show Palace Theater
Where Champagne bares all
In a low rent, nude revue

In the darkness, shadow people
Stare at Champagne glassy eyed
Takes the tips and imitates a smile
Waits for the aching to subside

And they say you're doing fine
They're just playing with your mind
And they never even know your name
But they all want you to shine, to glitter all the time
They all want a little taste of Champagne

Later in a room, on a little glass pipe
Sweet dreams to help him forget his life
He leans on the wall, rolls back his eyes
And says to all the aching, ""Goodbye""

Marc Almond,"Remember when we were back in school
Two young kids with wild ideas
Years gone by we sweated and saved
For a cupboard with a view
Now too old for work they say
What's the point in biding time
Living out our yesterday
When wild ideas could all come true

We could settle into being old
But all that glitters could be gold
So meet me in my dream
I won't fall asleep without you
Meet me in my dream
Underneath the Vegas lights

Look around our shabby room
Paper peeling curtains frayed
Faded photos on the wall
Like us they've all seen better days
We drew our savings from the bank
For roulette wheels and reckless nights
Sinatra's records on our minds
Fruit machines and neon lights

We threw away our everything
And blew it on a final fling
So meet me in my dream
I won't fall asleep without you
Meet me in my dream
It's lonely here without you
Remember way beck then in school
All the things we said we'd do
So meet me in my dream

Marc Almond,"Sad little boy of the street
Hands of a thief
With the mind of a dreamer
Dodging the puddles with feet
Of a torero in an arena
Sings an old andalucian song
Dancing along
Using his dirty red coat as a cape

Rain thundering down
Sounds like the applause from
Hundreds of people
He feels free as the wind
Free as the swifts
Around the cathedral
Kneels to acknowledge his fame
Forgets all his pain
Little toreador in the rain

Bathed in a rainbow of pink
Purple and blue outside la molina
The pavement reflecting the neon
Lights this torero in his arena
He looks down at his clothes
Imagining those
Worn of sequin, gold and brocade

He kneels and kisses the beast
Fearing the least
Knowing death will not find him
But maybe one day he will face
The horns of the devil
His childhood behind him

Brave young man from the streets
No more a thief
No longer a dreamer
Stands in front of the beast
A golden torero in an arena
It starts to thunder and rain
Remembering that day
He danced like a fool on the wing of a dream

Sand turning to mud
Soon where his blood will splatter and mingle
Free, free as an angel
Up with the swifts
Around the cathedral
Never to be seen again
Dreams all in vain
There lies the toreador in the rain

Little toreador in the rain
Little toreador in the rain

Locked inside my head
It creeps upon my mind
And warms me in my bed
A vision shimmering, shifting
Moving in false firelight
A vision of a vision
Protecting me from fear at night
As the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong
I don't know where you end
And where it is that I begin
I simply open my mind
And the memories flood on in
I remember waking up
With your arms around me
I remember losing myself
And finding that you'd found me
And the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong
Be my child, be my lover
Swallow me up in your fire glow
Take my tongue, Take my torment
Take my hand and don't let go
[Chorus]
Let me live in your life
For you make it all seem to matter
Let me die in your arms
So the vision will never shatter
And the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong

My love stayed strong
My love stayed strong
And my love stayed strong

While you sleep away the day
You go out every evening
Collecting waifs and strays

They follow their illusions
They don't know what to do
They need a clear direction
That's why they turn to you

You're pleading
Please don't leave me
Don't go from me so soon
I need to be found
For I'm a stray too

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

On the streets of Rome
They find a home
In shadow or in coffee bars
Down the winding alleys
Through the brightly lit arcades
No matter where they are

In and out of life they wander
Little waifs and strays
They stay until you fall in love
That's when they slip away

In the dark you'll see
Those sad brown eyes come shining through
Your heart will melt
You felt the way they looked at you

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

You find you need someone
To love your days away
Just when your heart is crying out
Please stay

You play with the food upon your plate
No one seems to be on your side
Things that threaten to hurt your pride

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

Smiling you did your time at school
Crying quietly like a fool
Saturday night and Sunday morning
Did all the things they asked you to do

They say that home is where the heart is
But home is only where the hurt is
Pull the wool over the eyes
Forget your worries that you started

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

When you stay out every night
The first time from your bedroom site
Started to show some concern
But by then it was too late

Fear it's time to pull away
Shut yours ears to all they say
Be yourself you know it's true
Because in the end what's left is you

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

Mother loves to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Father nevers undestand
When children have the upper hand

Marc Almond,"Now you're kissing other guys
And when you kiss you close your eyes
Do you hold regrets or do you easily forget
Can you be so quickly swayed
Can tender words just fade away
Can you blame me for feeling betrayed

As one love dies a new begins
Do you say the same to him
If he knew the things I knew
Would he say ""I love you too""
Soon you'll turn, for him too late
Recrimination and heartache
Would you blame him for feeling betrayed

Betrayed
Betrayed

Put all your trust in someone who
You believed was true to you
That's how a broken heart is made

Now I know your plan in mind
To take from everyone you find
Capture hearts with your cute smile
Hypnotize and beguile
Cruel love is the game you play
Were you treated once this way
The world dealt you a bad hand
And you're gonna make it pay
You were...

Betrayed
Betrayed

Put all your trust in someone who
You believed was true to you
That's how your broken heart was made

Keeps the boredom away

Champagne chilled
And the pills well spilled

And overkill

The curves
The kinks

That's what you call a star

Too many of my skeletons
In other people's closets
Too many people taking
Without leaving deposits
Too many people bringing me down
Bringing me down

Well they may find me on a hotel floor
High heels in a pool of gore
Curtains closed
And a bolted door
Breaking every law

And if I die before I wake up
I pray the Lord don't smudge my make-up
The dress will be fine when the hem I take up
The dress will be just fine

Sometimes I feel like a moral-less child
Sometimes I feel that I've gone too wild
Spilled my guts
Done myself in
Died for a multitude of sins
It feels good to die for your sins
It feels so good
So good boys

And end it all in tears
Lets all holler and beat our breasts
Ending it all in tears

For a guy named Tex

The little lights are dancing
And the clock on the wall is announcing another day
I keep hearing things you used to say

The way
And your mouth so dry
As you fake the kiss
Playing the part you do best you can

Lying there naked across the sheets
Like a lizard in the sand
Becoming me and failing to see
The little girl you've become

And you fall as you slink across the room
Your lips parted in a kiss
Parading your flesh in the way you know best
Like a broken seductress

I'm casting my mind back to my fourteenth year
When I learnt about what we call the pleasure of love
And it was new to me then
And a wave of sadness shivers my skin

With your face staring at the wall
Playing with reminders of yesteryear

And I was in love with you

Like your aura and your glammer
Make the legend
Easier to live through

And I once dreamed a look
I collected your memories too

And the face holds the pain
As you try to live your legend through

Aging to an art
Wishing we could grow together
When we only grow apart

It's so sad you never gave in smiling
Aging to an art
Wishing we could grow together
When we only grow apart

Life behind the shades is a life all in the mind
With no place in the living at all
You die with the dreams and so it seems
With imagination's down fall
Keep up the whispers
Incite the adoration
That glows around the image of you
With a kiss to the screen
As you play out the scene
As you try to live your legend through

And I once loved a smile
And I once dreamed a look
I collected your memories too
Now the eyes hold the flame
And the face holds the pain

",Your Aura
Marc Almond,"A tenement, a dirty street
Walked and worn by shoeless feet
Inside it's long and so complete
Watched by a shivering sun
Old eyes in a small child's face
Watching as the shadows race
Through walls and cracks and leave no trace
And daylight's brightness shuns

The days of Pearly Spencer
The race is almost run

Nose pressed hard on frosted glass
Gazing as the swollen mass
On concrete fields where grows no grass
Stumbles blindly on
Iron trees smother the air
But withering they stand and stare
Through eyes that neither know nor care
Where the grass is gone

The days of Pearly Spencer
The race is almost run

Pearly where's your milk white skin
What's that stubble on your chin
It's buried in the rot gut gin
You played and lost not won
You played a house that can't be beat
Now look your head's bowed in defeat
You walked too far along the street
Where only rats can run

The days of Pearly Spencer
The race is almost run
The days of Pearly Spencer
The race is almost run
The race is almost run

A tenement, a dirty street
Remember worn and shoeless feet
Remember how you stood to beat
The way your life had gone
So Pearly don't you shed more tears
For those best forgotten years
Those tenements are memories
Of where you've risen from

Marc Almond,"Another town, don’t know it’s name
An empty feeling, just the same
A silent drive, another show, to a lonely hotel room I’ll go
At times like these I miss you so

But a thousand hands applaud tonight
I sing my songs, my star shines bright
I stop and smile, I take my bow
I leave the stage and then somehow

Backstage, I'm lonely, backstage, I cry
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little

Out on that stage, I play the star
I'm famous now, I've come so far
A famous fool, I let love go
I didn't know I'd miss you so

Backstage, I'm lonely, backstage, I cry
Hating myself since I let you say goodbye
Backstage, I'm lonely, backstage, I cry
Hating myself since I let you say goodbye

Every night a different room, every night a different club
And yet I'm lonely all the time
When I sign my autograph, when I hold an interview
Can’t get you out of my mind

Come back my love, come back to me
I need you now so desperately
What good is fame? It's just a game
I'd give it all to be the same

Backstage, I wait now hoping I'll see
Your smiling face waiting there, backstage for me
Your smiling face waiting there, backstage for me

Backstage, backstage, backstage
You’re waiting for me backstage
You’re waiting for me backstage
Waiting for me backstage, waiting for me backstage

Marc Almond,"Sing a song of sad young men
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men
Sitting in the bars
Knowing neon lights
Missing all the stars

All the sad young men
They’re waiting in the cold
Trying to forget
That they're growing old

All the sad young men
Choking on their youth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
Someone to love them for just a little while

Tired little girl
Does the best
She does the best that she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man

While grimy moon
Watches from above
All the sad young men
Why they play making love, making love, making love

Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light
Guide them home again
All the sad young men

Off comes the clown's disguise

But I hope your smilin'
As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this business
That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

And feel the magic of their charms

And the hand that I can hold

I'll go to sleep and I'll dream again

",Stardom Road
Marc Almond,"These darker times

Where do we go from here?

Living for trivial information
It's a hopeless situation


Blinded by lies

False Gods and fake religions

Ulterior motives and bad intentions

Nobody knows what waits round the corner
We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




These darker times

Why has it come to this

Urban decay and revolution

Suicide is the only solution

Am I being unrealistic


To feel so nihilistic

Don't judge the stage of my mind
'cause brother we're two of a kind



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times



We gotta keep dancing
Through the years


We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times



Each night twisting

Turning in my bed

I'm trying to make sense of it all

Is it all in my head?



These darker times
Who shall I talk to now


Nothing going on in your eyes

Only the darkness in your eyes

It's a soulless situation

It's a spiritual vacation

Turn on the TV

Pass the remote

Turn off the light

And abandon all hope



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times



We gotta keep dancing
Through the years


We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times

Marc Almond,"Rain keeps on falling
Sun refuse to shine

And say that you are mine

Marc Almond,"It was the heat of the night I think
Or it could've been the effect of the drink
But I had to brush away the flies
That started to collect around your eyes

I've still the taste of the sweat and the dust
You're still playing games and abusing my trust
In the heat of the night
In the glow of the light

It's the back and the bite
That's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego

Do you need them for sex
It was a bite of a night gone wrong
And the effect of listening to negative songs
Stuck in a love scene from blood and sand

And the way the room keeps spinning around
I steal the taste of the sweat and the dust
(Now I know what they mean by looks can kill)
You're still playing games and abusing my trust

(And they're having a strange effect on the way I feel)
In the heat of the night
In the glow of the light
It's the back and the bite

That's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego
Do you need them for sex

And you're moaning about your wasted life
Lying there listening to ""Spanish Eyes""
With the cups on the floor
And the plates in the sink

And the room full of smoke
And then you full of drink
You skin's going dry
And the color of sand

Ignore the cigarette burning your hand",Heat
Marc Almond,"Over there
In the cold
Stands the Hustler
His eyes are old
He has seen a million ugly scenes
Places where men droop with mould
The backrooms
Where soiled goods are sold
Seen with opened eyes since frail fifteen
He has found it hard at first
But on his brow there sits a curse
For when the young must suffer
At the hands of men

Memories of Christmas past
Were never there to ever last
Things as were can never
Be again

Over there
By the wall
Stands the Hustler
He's not very tall
He's trampled by the jaded by the sly

He's seen the darker side of men
First fascinated and then
He found his urge to laugh
An urge to cry

He'll find close friends
No friend at all
He feels so lonely, tired and small
How few are chosen from
The golden call

There's something in us all it seems
To crave adventure
Hunt for dreams
But corruption the seducer spoils our schemes
And surely as the snow will melt
The Hustler
Grabs his soul and heads for home
With lessons learnt under his belt

Over there
By the wall
Stands the Hustler
With the men of law
On either side to flank the sallow youth
But some of us will never learn
It takes the blow of fists to burn
How painfully we suffer for the truth",The Hustler
Marc Almond,"We've hit those depths again
Playing black games again
Black mellow lies
And the narrowing of eyes
Playing those games again
You hold the reins again
But then I turned the card
And you know I hit hard

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

Shaking your head that way
It's so true when they say
That love is a pain in the heart
A pain that pulls apart
I'm breaking rules again
You're breaking hearts again
Pretend to despise
When there's love in your eyes

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

And I'm loving you
And you're hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the other side of love



",Loving You Hating Me
Marc Almond,"Come and meet
Another kind of love
Meet another kind of love
Different than the real thing
But just as demanding
And just as demeaning

Treacled in apathy
All worries swept away
By one so simple act of annihilation
And I've not cried like this
And I've not felt this calm

Meet murder my angel
You've arrived at the moment
To cross over the threshold

I met another kind of love
Met another kind of love
And I've not felt alive in this way
For a long time

Your pleaser
Annoyer
Destroyer
And voyeur
Waits alone at the corner
At the back door to paradise

You're shaking all over

And there's no way back my angel
There's no way back for an angel

I'd like to drown me in my coffee
Counting hours with cappuccinos


Sitting framed within the window




I sit here acting like I'm reading
I'm lonely

I'm reading minds


And sadly dreaming
There's some of me left to believe in



Surrender

That businessman smell
Found in one night hotels

The sheets are unwashed

Tobacco and sweat
From the stories they tell


And initials in dust


The man at the desk
Throws you looks of disgust


Soon I'll try hard to lose you
Drown you in my cappuccino

Come tomorrow


I won't know you from Adam or Eve

Look me in the eyes

And tell me you love me

Once, before you leave

Marc Andre,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home

Marc Anthony,"No hay día que pase
Que yo no me acuerde de ti
No hay labios que bese
Que no, no me sepan a ti

De mis sentimientos
Aunque estés lejos
De nada me sirve
Porque yo te quiero

Wow!

He tratado de olvidarte
Y todavía no lo consigo
Todavía siento tu amor
En mi pecho encendido
He tratado de olvidarte
Y todavía no lo consigo
Y es que cada anochecer
Deseo estar contigo
He tratado de olvidarte
Y todavía no lo consigo
Que me hiciste, que me diste
Que quede por tu amor mal herido, oh

Wow!

Yo lucho y lucho, ay como lucho
Yo trato y trato, pero es en vano
Yo lucho y lucho
Pero te extraño
Ay, como lucho

Marc Anthony,"Mirándonos tu y yo
Deseándonos
La luna sobre nuestro amor
Cada segundo se hacia eterno

Mis manos atrevidas
En tu cuerpo navegaban
Tu estabas confundida
El deseo te traicionaba
Luchabas sin remedio
Contra lo inevitable

Que linda tu, que impropio yo
La luna llena
Nosotros dos
Deseándonos, amándonos

Tu y yo
Abordo de un hechizo
En ruta al paraíso
Solos tu y yo

Amantes sin remedio

Y el deseo como siempre
Traicionando a la razón
Y tus ojos suplicando por favor

Y me falta tanto
Para irme llenando
El vació adentro
Que tu me has dejado
Lento va quemando

Todo ha sido en vano
Todo ha sido falso
Esto es un mal sueno
Eso es un engaño
Que tu llamas amor

Pero el amor es blanco
Y tu me lo has manchado
Es un niño ingenuo
Que tu has maltratado
Es confiado y libre
Ya ahora vive en prisión
El amor es todo
Y tu lo has vuelto nada
Es calor de un beso
No una fría cama
Es una pareja
Convertida en uno
Y tu y yo somos dos

Ya logre borrarme
La ultima caricia
Ya no siento pena
Ya no tengo risa

Marc Anthony,"No me conoces
Y haré tres noches que dormiste
Entre mis brazos
Ya no recuerdas las tantas cosas
Que conmigo hiciste tú
Como creerte si te morías cada vez
Que me besabas
Y hasta decías haber anhelado siempre
Un hombre como yo 

En ocasiones tape tu boca
Para que no se escucharan
Los fuertes gritos enloquecidos
Que brotaban de tu ser 

Ahora te empeñas
En ignorarme cuando te miro a los ojos
Pones la cara como sintiendo enojos
Como si yo fuera un extraño en tu vida 

Si esa es tu forma
Lamento mucho haber estado contigo
Aunque confieso y
Pongo a Dios como testigo
Que estoy muriendo, por tenerte
Una vez más 

No me conoces
Y hasta una foto me pediste
Aquella noche para guardarla
Y acariciarla cuando te acuerdes de mi

Ahora te empeñas
En ignorarme cuando te miro a los ojos
Pones la cara como sintiendo enojos
Como si yo fuera un extraño en tu vida 

No me conoces, mi amor
Nadie sabrá de lo nuestro
De aquella noche sin freno
Del temblor de tu cuerpo
Y del calor de tus besos

No, no me conoces

Pero tu y yo lo sabemos
Que fuiste lenya, yo fuego
Y ahora resulta
Que no soy suficiente para ti, oh

Marc Anthony,"Otra noche que promete
Ser igual de cruel
Para mi corazón
Una mas que pasaré
Sin escuchar tu voz
Otra dosis de agonía
Y yo sin encontrar
Alguna solución
Todo me recuerda a ti
En esta habitación

Esta casa que ha vivido
En carne propia nuestro amor
Cada cuadro que pusimos
El jarrón junto al sillón
Las caricias que nos dimos
Antes de decir adiós
Y esta foto, la primera de los dos

No sabes como duele la vida
No sabes como duele tu adiós
Yo se que ni siquiera imaginas
El daño que me has hecho, mi amor
No sabes como duele perderte
No sabes come duele aceptar
Que para mi es urgente olvidarte
Y no tengo valor para empezar",No Sabes Como Duele

Por volverme a buscar
Por hablar de los dos
Y salir a cenar
Tal parece que yo
Te hice falta de más
Que no fuiste feliz
Con tu otra mitad
De repente te da
Por volver a sentir
Quien es el que en verdad
Sabe hacerte feliz
Pero se te olvidó
Que al marcharte de aquí
Yo quedé igual que tú
Libre para elegir

Y hubo alguien
Que se encargó de darme
Todo cada tarde
Que se moría por llenarme
De detalles y palabras amables
Sí hubo alguien
Que mientras tu vivías
Tu vida muy aparte
Se encargaba de la mía con coraje
Y logró conquistarme
Y a ese alguien
Una noche de locura interminable
Le entregué mi cariño, mi cuerpo
Mi alma, mi mente y mi ser
Como tú ya no sabes

De repente te da
Por romper a llorar
Por decir que jamás
Me pudiste olvidar
Pero se te pasó
Que al marcharte de aquí
Yo quedé igual que tú
Libre para elegir

Wow!

Se te olvidó decirme adiós
Se te olvidó decirme adiós
Y hubo alguien
Alguien que llenó mis días
Y llenó mis noches
Con una nueva ilusión

Se te olvidó decirme adiós
Se te olvidó!
Se te olvidó decirme adiós
Y hubo alguien
Se te olvidó decirme adiós
Abrías mi puerta para otro amor

Ella me da tanto
Tú me dejaste ir
Y no pensaste en mi
Y ahora no puedes vivir
Sola, sin mi
Ahora hay alguien que me da
Mucho amor y un cariño
Sincero, perfecto y bonito, tú ves

Wow!

Te lloré
Te digo, te lloré, te lloré
Te lloré
Te digo, te lloré, te lloré
Te lloré
Desconsolado
Te lloré
Triste y desesperado
Tú no pensaste en mi, pena
Y te marchaste, mi nena

Y llora, que te llora
Llora, que te llora
Llora!
Pero tú ya no me importas
Oh, y ahora no puedes vivir
Sola, sin mi
Y ahora no puedes vivir
Sola, sin mi
Y ahora no puedes vivir

De mi borinquen hermosa

Se del olor de sus rosas
Por eso a mi tierra riquena
Por siempre la llamare Preciosa

Isla del caribe
Isla del caribe

Preciosa te llaman las olas
Del mar que te bana
Preciosa por ser un encanto
Por ser un Eden

why tienes la noble hidalguia
De la Madre Espana
Why el fiero cantio del indio bravio
Lo tienes tambien

Preciosa te llaman los bardos
Que cantan tu historia
No importa el tirano te trate
Con negra maldad

Preciosa seras sin bandera
Sin lauros, ni gloria
Preciosa, Preciosa

Te llaman los hijos de la libertad
Preciosa te llevo dentro
Muy dentro di mi corazon
Why mientras mas pasa el tiempo
En ti se vuelca mi amor

Porque ahora es que comprendo
Porque ahora es que comprendo
Que aunque pase lo que pase
Yo sere puertoriqueno
Yo sere puertoriqueno

Por donde quiera que ande, oh
Por que lo llevo en la sangre
Por herencia de mis padres
Why con orgullo repito

why por eso es que me nace hoy

A ese noble jibarito Raphael
Why a mi isla del encanto

There's even talk about you wanting me

Marc Anthony,"Days have passed
And still no sign of us
Not a hint of what used to be
When you lived in that part of me
This blinding silence
Lives in every room

Of what once was a happy home
Now we're sitting here all alone
Could this be that it was all a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

[Chorus: x2]
Am I the only one
Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
and the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thought of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Could this be that it was a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

Y necesitas vivir
Para aprender a querer
Y no comprendes mi bien
Que no basta con la piel

Marc Anthony,"It was a coldest day in December
A day I always will remember
I looked into your eyes
And faced my deepest fear
I had drifted too far
Far from you my dear

So how could I
Turn away from the one I love
How could I
When I know what my heartâ??s made of
Could it be
That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye

Why was I so afraid to tell her
That for her I would fight a thousand soldiers
But just like an angry child
I kept my feelings locked inside
There were rivers of tears
Flowing from her eyes

So how could I
Turn away from the one I love
How could I
When I know what my heartâ??s made of
Could it be
That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye

When you fall in love
You never know how long it lasts
But the one thing I knew in my heart
Is that I was fading much too fast

So how could I
Turn away from the one I love
How could I
When I know what my heartâ??s made of
Could it be
That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye",How Could I
Marc Anthony,"When you hold me like this 
So many memories fill my eyes 
The first time we kissed 
The times we nearly said good bye 
But still here we are 
Tested and tried and still true 
And stronger than we ever knew 

Love is all 
The laughter and the tears that fall 
The mundane and the magical 
Love is all 
All is love 
The careless word  the healing touch 
The getting and the getting of 
All is love 

There's a me you've always known 
The me that's a stranger still 
The you that feels like home 
And the you that never will 
But still here we lie 
Tender and trusting and true 
With everything that we've been through 
Repeat chorus 
All the glory 
All the pain 
All the passion 
That turns into ashes 
Only to rise again 
Repeat chorus",Love Is All
Marc Anthony,"As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life's worth a thousand skies
You're the simplest love I've known
And the purest one I'll own
Know you'll never be alone

[Chorus]
My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And 'cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
Baby you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive.

Though these words I sing are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile?
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

[Chorus]

I will soothe you if you fall
I'll be right there if you call
You're my greatest love of all

[Chorus]

Mostly to myself cause you make me believe
No one could ever love you like I could

There wouldn't be a day when you would feel alone
And never would there be a time that you didn't know
That no one could ever love you like I could

So if you'd be the one to share in all my dreams
I'd never let you go
If you'd stay with me
I promise you'll always know
I couldn't spend my life without you
And please believe me I would never doubt you

I'll be the one to (help) answer all your prayers
Anytime you need me
Know that I'll be there
Cause no one could ever love you like I could
No one could ever hold you like I would
Cause no one could ever love you like I would

So if you'd be the one to share in all my dreams
I'd never let you go
If you'd stay with me
I promise you'll always know
I couldn't spend my life without you
And please believe me I would never doubt you

I'm hopin' that you hear these prayers of mine
I'm hopin' we'll be together for all time

No one could ever hold you like I would
Cause no one could ever love you like I would",No One
Marc Anthony,"It's not enough
To say I've loved and lost
Just a thought
To know I had it all
Times can change
But love will not grow old
Turn the page
Turn down this bed alone

[Chorus]
Do you still remember me
How could you forget
You're everything I need
I'm out here on the ledge
There's no words for me to say
And too much to regret
You're where I should be
Do you remember when
I let you go
What was I thinking of
I'll never know
What it's like to love
But there's no way
How can I replace
Love so strong
When I can't forget your face

[Chorus]

We used to dance
I used to sing
Do you remember
You and me
'cause if I could
Hold your hand
I'd be a king
'cause I remember

Marc Anthony,"Girl I see how you're looking at me
And I must say you're looking sexy
But the truth is my baby has been good to me
Girl the way that you move's so tempting
Gotta say that I like what I see
But the truth is my baby has been good to me

Friday, I saw you looking my way
I know that you've been wanting me
I can see it in the way you've been taunting me
Your eyes make it hard for me to walk away
When the truth is I want to stay
All I gotta say is girl there's just no way

Girl I see how you're looking at me
And I must say you're looking sexy
But the truth is my baby has been good to me
Girl the way that you move's so tempting
Gotta say that I like what I see
But the truth is my baby has been good to me

In my mind I've made love to you a thousand times
But that is where I draw the line
I could lose everything that it took so long to find
Let me be as clear as I could be
Though you do what you do to me
I gotta tell you girl there's just no way

Girl I see how you're looking at me
And I must say you're looking sexy
But the truth is my baby has been good to me
Girl the way that you move's so tempting
Gotta say that I like what I see
But the truth is my baby has been good to me

She's been good to me
She's the only one who ever really stood by me
She believes in me
She's the only one who ever took a chance on me
So girl there's just no way

Girl I see how you're looking at me
And I must say you're looking sexy

Gotta say that I like what I see

Marc Anthony,"I remember how it used to be
When you said you were in love with me
Now I'm all alone sitting by the phone
There's that memory hanging over me

Oh, you were something
And now we're nothing

[Chorus]
I still can't believe you're leaving me
In the middle of what used to be our thing,
That's okay
And I still don't see a reason for you killing me the way you did that day
That's okay

I can't shake all that you promised me
Can't believe I let it conquer me
Now you're on your way to that better day
And I'm here at home sitting all alone

Oh, you were something
And that's why were nothing

[Chorus]",That's Okay
Marc Anthony,"I have been in love and been alone
I have traveled over many miles to find a home
There's that little place inside of me
That I never thought could take control of everything
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way
I had never known what's right for me
Till the night she opened up my heart and set it free
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night

When I called you late last night you see
I was falling into love
Yes I was crashing into love
Of all the words you said to me
About life, the truth and being free
Yeah you sang to me

Girl, I live for how you make me feel
So I question all this being real

For the first time I'm not afraid of love

Ya te veo que me estás mirando
La conciencia me está matando
No puedo olvidar como ella me quiere a mí
Babería de tus placeres
Pero sé que su amor me espera
No puedo olvidar como ella me quiere a mí

Veo, lo que me estás haciendo
Sé que quieres seducirme

Siento que en cualquier momento yo podré
Como un loco rendirme a tus pies

Marc Anthony,"Te marchaste en tu barco de papel
Diciendo que el amor tiene sus dudas
Y me dejaste sin sueños otra vez
Como un espectador de tus locuras

Y se marché también mi fantasía
Detrás de tu partida silenciosa
Sabiendo que un ejército de espinas
Protege a tu suerte caprichosa

Y se escapé el amor, amor aventurero
Raíces de cartón y corazón de acero
Y se escapé el amor, robándose tu pelo
Y se llevé también las noches bajo el cielo
Y se escapé el amor, el hueco de mi cama
Lo mismo que un ladrón salté por la ventana
Y se escapé el amor detrás de tu mentira
Abriendo una vez más la misma herida
La misma herida, ah

De pronto me quedé sin esperanza
Tu barco de papel no se vea
Y alarma le di un poco de confianza
Trepándome a la rueda de la vida

Y se escapé el amor, amor aventurero
Raíces de cartón y corazón de acero
Y se escapé el amor, robándose tu pelo
Y se llevé también las noches bajo el cielo
Y se escapé el amor, el hueco de mi cama
Lo mismo que un ladrón salté por la ventana
Y se escapé el amor detrás de tu mentira
Abriendo una vez más la misma herida
La misma herida, ah

Salté por la ventana
Ese amor que pa' mi no estaba
No estaba para mi este amor fugaz
Yo que pensaba que era de verdad

Salté por la ventana
Ese amor que pa' mi no estaba
Y ahora me encuentro en la soledad
Por culpa de tus mentiras

Marc Anthony,"Si es como dices qué haces aquí
Envenenando este mes de abril
Con ese cuerpo de alambre que
No es sombra ni de lo que fue

Si lo has dejado qué haces aquí
Como una rosa rota en la basura
Porqué me miras asé
A quién le quieres mentir
Tienes los ojos llenos de agonía

Te daré cobijo
Te daré calor
Por ti, mi pajarilla herido
Pintaré de rosa la melancolía
Por favor no digas que estés bien

Barco a la deriva que
Se hunde un poco cada día
Barco a la deriva que
No quiere ver el faro, no

Barco a la deriva que
Se hunde un poco cada día
Barco a la deriva que
No puede ver el faro que le guía

Oh, si en plena lava bajo el volcán
Siguen brotando
Las más bellas flores
Porque no puedes cortar
Los hilos del espiral
Que van metiéndote
Vidrio en las venas

No, ya no te voy abandonar
Saldrás de aquí mi cervatillo herido
No podré dormir
Mientras estés hundida
Por favor no digas que estés bien

No tengas miedo nunca más
Sabes que no te voy abandonar
No tengas miedo nunca más

Yo no te voy
Yo no te voy a abandonar

Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí

Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel
Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte
Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me aleje y en cambio quise

Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche

Marc Anthony,"Que dependencia
Dan su olor y sus besos
De la forma de hablarse y mirarse
Que hacen que el techo del cuarto sea de cielo

Qué dependencia
Sus sueños despiertos
Sus promesas calladas
Que le gritan al alma
Lo que se lleva por dentro

Como guerreros con miedo
Bajo una luna dormida
Ellos prefieren callar a decir la verdad
Y descubrir las heridas

De qué depende, depender
De sentirse inseguro
Incapaz, inmaduro
De qué depende depender

De esconderse entre muros
Que uno mismo ha hecho suyos
Puede ser, no lo sé, sólo sé

De sus preguntas respuestas
De su alegría y tristezas
Sus calmas tormentas

De su apego a la muerte
Que se disfraza de vida

Hasta que te des cuenta
Que este corazón herido
No querer sentir las horas
Cuando sepa que te has ido

Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me dar por vencido
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo yo no descansar
Aquí esperando siempre estar
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me dar por vencido

Hasta que vuelvas conmigo aquí estar
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me dar por vencido

No sabia lo que pasaba
Hasta el cuerpo me temblaba

Marc Anthony,"Tal vez tu tenías razón
Tal vez tu tenías razón
Y era inútil esconderse
O soñar, comprometerse
Tantas cosas

Tal vez tu tenías razón
Tal vez tu tenías razón
Y ese miedo que sentías
Que gritaba, que perdías
Tantas cosas
Era yo

Y tan fácil que a mi ha sido
No enredar nuestros destinos
Y dejar que los caminos
Continuaran separados
Pero tal vez yo tenía razón
Y solo había que vivir

Ay sin miedo, sin excusas
Vivir
Inventando la locura
Vivir

Como Dios habría querido
Vivir
Recordándolo al olvido
Vivir

Rescatando lo perdido
Vivir
Y perder hasta la vida
Viviendo, oh

Es cuestión de corazón
Es cuestión de corazón
Ay, de morir en el intento
De sentir cada momento

Tantas cosas
Tantas cosas
Que aunque duelan
Son la esencia de la vida
Tal vez yo tenía razón
Y solo había que vivir

Solo habría que vivir
Hay que vivir, que vivir
Solamente hay que vivir
Solo habría que vivir

Como Dios habría querido
Darnos al amor
Solo habría que vivir
Es cuestión de corazón

Entregarlo todo
Solo habría que vivir
Hay que vivir, que vivir

Yo no quiero sufrir

Y me sientas en tu cama

Marc Anthony,"I used to try
To set aside
Some time for being lonely

So many times
I prayed to find
Someone like you to hold me

All i know is that when i think of you
I'm not alone
I just simply close my eyes
And sing my song
And i am home
Loving where i belong

Do you believe in loneliness?
I do now
That's where I found you and I'll never let you go
When all i knew was onlyness
There you were
With you around
Who's lonley now

I feared the night
But now it's mine
'Cause something's out there for me

Let's take our time
I'm satisfied
With having you to own me

All i know is that when i think of you
I'm not alone
I just simply close my eyes
And sing my song
And i am home
Loving where i belong

Do you believe in loneliness?
I do now
That's where I found you and I'll never let you go
When all i knew was onlyness
There you were
With you around
Who's lonely now

Do you believe in loneliness?

Marc Anthony,"We've been over this before
And I'm sensing you want more
I don't need someone who complicates me

And it's not that I don't care
But there's some things I can't share
Girl, I told you I'm not there

Girl, the world's been down on me
I don't need someone to own me
Girl, a lover is all I need
I'm the one who needs to hold me

since I met you, I've been hearing the same thing
And it seems it's all we talk about lately
So before you go out on the limb
Don't tell me it's love
It's that look in your eyes that betrays me
And the things that you do to amaze me
Don't tell me it's so

What I'm offering's what you see
I'm giving you my honesty
And I'm sorry if it hurts to hear the truth

And maybe I will find in time
That all along girl, you were right
That I should have made you mine

But for now I still believe
That I don't need someone to own me
Just a lover is all I need
And someone who's gonna hold me

since I met you, I've been hearing the same thing
And it seems it's all we talk about lately
So before you go out on the limb
Don't tell me it's love

Marc Anthony,"I love the way you smile when I look in your eyes.
I love the way you laugh when I try to be funny.
And how the tears roll down your face when I say no one could ever take your
Place.

[Chorus]
Cause baby when you sleep, I watch you breathing. 
And baby when you dream, I dream with you.
Cause everywhere you are is where I wanna be, It's true.
Everything you do makes me know how much I love you.

The way you touch my lips right after every kiss,
And softly whisper that I'm your everything.
The way you pray our love wont die
Every night just before you close your eyes.

I believe that things were meant to be.
As sure as there is love, yours is meant for me.

Marc Anthony,"I should have told you
I should have found a way
I should have worked a little harder just to show you love

If I'd have given
A little more of my time

Now I am faced with lonely nights
And I can't bear to live my life
Knowing that I might be losing you

[Chorus]
Give me a reason to stay 
Because I want to
Baby, just give me a sign that let's me know you really care
Show me a better way that 
I can love you
Baby, I'll do my best to make a change
Just give me a reason

I wanna please you
I wanna understand
I wanna know that you still want me when I touch your hand

That you're just scared to try

And I can't bear to live my life
Knowing that I might be losing you

Marc Anthony,"Baby love
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you what I'm thinking of
So I try to find a way that I can show you love
What you mean to me

It's not enough to give you everything that you were ever dreaming of
I could never find a way that I could pay you love
For all the things you do
'Cause when my life gets crazy
The only one who comforts me is you

When I'm feeling all alone
When I'm searching for someone I can run to 
I reach for you
When I need a hand to hold
Or a place where I can feel what love can do
I reach for you

Needing you
Is something that I've really gotten used to 
I can't imagine being here with no one else
No one but you

What I found 
Is it doesn't get much better than when you're around
Having you is all I really need when I get down
You pull me through

'Cause when my life
Gets crazy
The only one who comforts me is you

And I'm waiting for the day you say that you belong to me
I swear
No one will ever love you better
I swear
We could be so good together

[Chorus]
I never wanted anyone the way I want you (baby)
I never met someone who gives me everything you do
I swear
If I'm with you there's no other
I swear
There will never be another

Cause of you there are more reasoned to be thankful everyday
Cause of you I'm reminded of the chances I should take
It't the comfort of your warm embrace that shelters all the rain
And there's nothing I wouldn't give for you to feel the same
I swear
No one will ever love you better
I swear
We could be so good together

Somewhere, Somehow you appeared
And everything's so different now
When your around

Marc Anthony,"All my life
I've followed signs
On many a road

Tried to find
What was right
And do what I'm told

But sometimes
You cross the line
And never can go back home

I've been here
And I've been there
Always on the go

Looking for
Something more
To call my own

Up to now
I have found
That life as a whole was cold

'Cause I've never belonged

[Chorus]
I want to be free
And live without warning
I want to finally see
What it's like on the other side
I want to be free
'Cause a new day is dawning
I want to be me
I want to show the world I'm alive

Who's to say
I need change
And I am not what I'm not

Look at me
And what you see
Has been through a lot

Now it's time
For me to find
What love's really all about
And all that I've lived without

Marc Anthony,"Baby when I think about you
I don't need to think 'cause I just know
That baby it's the way you love me
That makes me so damn sure that your the one
Don't you know that I've waited for you
You are everything I've wanted all my life
Never thought I would find what I need
'Til you came along my dreams seemed so far away

[Chorus]
I could be with another girl
And I can take a trip all around the world
But why would I go anywhere when I've got you
I could spend my money on fancy clothes
Meet a thousand women doing videos and shows
But baby I'm so glad that I got you
Maybe I just got lucky

'Cause a chance like this don't come along every day
And can we hold on to what we've got
If I ever lost you girl, my whole life would change
You should know that your life gives me strength
And without you I don't know where I would be
It's because of your sould I'm at ease
No matter where I am I'm not alone. eh

[Chorus]

All that I have
Is nothing when it compares to you
And I can't believe
Hoe your love makes me feel
I'm glad that I've got you
And girl you've got me too

[Chorus]",I've Got You
Marc Anthony,"Look what you do to me
Oh girl, I must admit that this is new to me.
And I never thought that love could vome so easily.
'Til you opened up my eyes to how it's supposed to be.
I'd never known love to be so pure and gentle.
In all I've seen love was quite this simple.
It was for me so lonely and so temperamental.

[Chorus:]
Holding you is the safest place no doubt about it
Kissing you makes me wonder how I lived without it
Wanting you is as natural as natural can be
Love won't get any better

Finally I hold my head up high 'cause you belong to me
And I'm catching myself smiling over everything
You should know that I am proud to have you next to me.
I'd never known love to be so pure and gentle
In all I've seen love was never quite this simple 
It was for me lonely and so temperamental

Girl I'm in love with you
I live to kiss and touch you
I always knew
You'd be the one to run to
I'd say I do

She can't see
That she's taken the best part of me

With nothing left to tear apart
Half of me is walking 'round
The other half is on the ground

It's all on me

A comentarme que te duelen tantas cosas

Y muchas veces soy el eco de tus penas
Ten cuidado que no te asalten ni se crucen

Pues tus frases y tus dulces gestos
Son la hiel
Que me lanzan, me seducen y provocan 

No se trata de perdones ni de excusas
Solo quiero que tu trates de evitarlo
Deja quieta la pasión y los sentidos

Dejando atrás lo que fue parte de tu vida
Tomando lo que no era tuyo

Como matar de un día para el otro

Hasta cuando volverás
A mis brazos no lo se

Necesito de tu fe
Para entender

Como me cambio de piel

El miedo eterno a caer
Como le puedo enseñar a la razón
que equivocarse es humano

Sin ti las noches son eternas,
Tu aroma sigue aquí, no me deja ir
Por más que intente y quiera olvidarte,
Yo nunca lograre dejarte,
Cautivo de este amor sincero
Esclavo de tu voz

Por que estoy amándote, soñandote,
Aunque no estés aquí
Y yo te esperare,
Amor aunque los años lleguen sin querer,
Yo te perdonare,
Si en otros besos y otra piel encuentras el amor

Marc Anthony,"Aturdido y abrumado, por la duda de los celos
Se ve triste en la cantina a un bohemio ya sin fe
Con los nervios destrozados y llorando sin remedio
Como un loco atormentado por la ingrata que se fue
Se ve siempre acompañado del mejor de los amigos
Que le acompaña y le dice ya esta bueno de licor
Nada remedias con llanto, nada remedias con vino
Al contrario, la recuerda mucho mas tu corazón

Una noche como un loco, mordió la copa de vino
Y le hizo un cortante filo, que su boca destrozó
Y la sangre que brotaba, confundiose con el vino
Y en la cantina este grito a todos estremeció

No te apures compañero si me destrozo la boca
No te apures que es que quiero con el filo de esta copa
Borrar la huella de un beso, traicionero que me dio

Mozo, sírvame, la copa rota
Sírvame que me destroza, esta fiebre de obsesión
Mozo, sírvame, la copa rota
Quiero sangrar gota a gota, el veneno de su amor

Marc Anthony,"Halle una flor
Un día en el camino
Que apareció marchita y deshojada
Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro
Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla

Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos
A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma
Recuperó el color que había perdido
Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara

Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor
La fui abrigando en mi alma
Y en el invierno le daba calor
Para que no se dañara

De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo
Y he prometido cuidarla
Para que nadie le robe el color
Para que nunca se vaya

De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas
Nació el amor que un día se había perdido
Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra
Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido

Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor
La fui abrigando en mi alma
Y en el invierno le daba calor
Para que no se dañara

De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo
Y he prometido cuidarla
Para que siempre este cerca de mí
Para que nunca se vaya

(Para que nunca se vaya)
(Para que nunca se vaya)
(Para que nunca se vaya)

Con otro amor así

Yo me quede indiferente

Lo que hubo entre los dos

Morir de amor fingiendo estar alegre
Queriendo amar y estar indiferente, indiferente

Es mi sonrisa donde escondo el llanto
Mi cuerpo tiene aquel perfume tuyo
Que me recuerda como estoy sufriendo
Y que de celos yo me estoy muriendo

Comprendí que solo a ti te quiero tanto
Y me quede indiferente
Si al lado de él ya vives tan contenta
No hago falta más, luchar para que
Te amo más que a mi vida

Now she's dead, but whose this head
Speaking of things apart

Born a true blue thoroughbred
Head a chiselled face of fables

Blooms that twine around your ears
Blossoms of the royalest texture angel of the years

Clad in sacks and scraps of linen
Living 'neath your waterwell
Praying that my youthy pauper's face
Will quench you well

Gazelle girl striding through your palace
Precious jewels nestle in your hair
Rameses born with platinum future
Take my heart and care.

I said girl wouldn't you like to rock
But could it give me love
Give me little love from god's heart

Walking down by the westwind
I met a boy he was my friend
I said boy we could sing it too
And we do
Give us love
Give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts

My gone little mama cut out without a sound

With my greased-up levis,
Baseball boots above my head
If it wasn't such a tragedy
I might wish I was dead

She took my ice-cream mustang
And my purple coloured dodeville
She even took my panpipes and my elixir of life pill

Marc Bolan,"Jasper was fine but he had glass eyes
He crucified me with his pixie coloured lies
His hair was black, he had a bend in his back
He tied my cousin Eddy to the railroad tracks
The train it come, he started to run
Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun
Jasper was born with a moth in his mind
The moth was too soft on the curtain behind
He startled the face of a friend of my girl's
He cut out her eyes and he wore them with furs
I get half the dues, wear my shoes
Tonight you might laugh while crying the news
'cause Jasper C. Debussy, that's his kind of blues

Mama

Jasper he dressed in the darkest of clothes
He wears scarlet pantaloons and five foot one inch hose
His face is like a rock and his eyes like the night
He's like a grim faced dog that's looking for a fight
Silhouette looks like a furry Persian rat
When you see him coming mama, you'd better run
Because Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun

My Baby she knows I'm on a scene
My baby keeps asking where I've been
My baby's guessing that I'm messing
It's all put together with alligator leather.

Marc Bolan,"Met a woman she's spouting prose
She's got luggage eyes and a roman nose
Her body is slung from side to side
Need a lift she said much obliged
I'm riding piggy-back
Then I came to her shack

We go inside the place it's a mess
She said my name's the liquid poetess
She unties her mouth
And her buckskin dress
She drinks from a bottle
Labelled tenderness
I'm in one hand in the other's a can

She puts me in the can
And smiles through the wall
I got the horror's 'cause I'm one inch tall
Next thing I know's a girl by my side
Dressed in a bayleaf she's trying to hide
I asked her name she said Germaine
Do the rock do the one inch rock.



",One Inch Rock
Marc Bolan,"I saw this mirror, I looked through it
Reflections looked most better than all
Cared too much, hating hatred
Seeing things deformed and almost cold
Crying sadly, shielding gladly my eyes
From the ugly side of fat men seeing, almost
Thin men peeping, sleeping, looking, falling
Dizzy from their windows high

The men of magic thinking if evil
He was bringing sunless children
Seeing all the bad,
'cause beauty was too ugly
And faceless people
Wondered at the beautiful forms they had

Now the mirror's broken
I'm smiling, seeing good things
Yet despite foot splinters swirl in the air
Forever call him beauty
Children come at night time
Weird things blackening the fairest maiden's hair

Marc Bolan,"My eyes went up 
It was sunrise 
The sky turned black 
It was noon 

A ship of the silverest 
Metal 
Shadowed out 
All of the moon 

A shape 
That was golden and crimson 
Extend a claw 
To my frame 

I sunk in the sand 
Like an infant 
I screamed 
But my tongue was lame

My eyes 
Were all fiery flame 

A sound like sweet dove 
I did stutter 
And then the ship 
Swum the skies again",The Visit
Marc Bolan,"A box of doves
I placed beside your chest
Liar, a stork of silk
With rubies in it's nest

Fire of my love
Will burn thee
To a wizened word
For ere to go unheard

A mare of wood
Elder, elm and oak
Liar, will keep you fair
If you jest me, no joke

Fire of my love
Will burn thee
To a wizened word
For ere to go unheard

I'm old and bruised
But my fate is that of youth
Liar, trickster you
Be a grisly dragon's tooth

Fire of my love
Will burn thee
To a wizened word
For ere to go unheard

You gashed the heart of my heart
Like a Portuguese witch
I'd planned for you this land
But you devoured my hand

Smells like rain
There's a way you look at me baby
Heals my pain
Now I've studied every inch of your body

The touch of your skin just pulls me in
Every single time

There's a silent conversation
Filled with hidden revelations
In your eyes

Every whisper from you soul to my heart

And that's the beauty of who you are

There's a faith you're saving for a rainy day
I could use right now
There's a way you move my soul to sing 
Only you know how

You are sensual salvation
With the holiest temptation
Baby I'm never never never gonna be the same

Marc Broussard,"""Rolling down the road, going nowhere,
Guitar packed in a trunk
Somewhere around mile marker 1-12,
Papa started hummin' the funk
I gotta jones in my bones before they know,
We were singing this melody
Stop the car pulled out the guitar,
Halfway to New Orleans

Said take me home
Take me home

Could feel the sun about to rise,
When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope,
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night,
Spillin' over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road,
Groovin' far as the eye can see

Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home
Said take me home

This Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy finally found,
Said this Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy done finally found his way home
Said take me home

Here we go,
Hot damn you should have felt the groove,
Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot,
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky,
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes,
And we disappeared into the groove

Said take me home
Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home

Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
You don't know nothin' about this

Hopes and dreams push away the pain and regret

Between the moments that linger before us
Haven't you wondered why I always leave?

And everything I do reminds me of being with you
It's a lonely night but I'll be alright

What the future will bring
When you wrap your wings
And take me where you are
Where you and I will be together
Once again, we'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be, where you are

And I can see your face
Your kiss I still can taste
Not a memory erased

Oh, how I see your star
Shinin' down on me
And I'd do anything
If I could just, be right there where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight

And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin' back at me)

Only then will I be free
Then I will be free, so take me where you are

Now baby there are times when selfishly
I wishin' that you were here with me
So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see

That every night when you are dreamin'
I'm here to guard you from afar
And anytime I feel in love
I'll close my eyes and dream of where you are

Where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight

And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin' back at me)

What's that you ask?
I have no name, I have no name
For I am known only as man
For I am known only as man

I'm a wanderer, I have no place or time
I'm just drifting on this lonely road of mine
And if you like you can come along with me
But I promise you that I am not the man I used to be
But I promise you that I am not the man I used to be

Now you and I we've seen our share of ups and downs
Somewhere we just lost hope
I can't change the past but who cares?

Marc Broussard,"Hey, you were good at playing the fox, girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hot for nobody
Girl, just you wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown before

'Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Hey, baby you were playing the part with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cool, baby

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
'Cause my love love light's burning

When you play with my affection
You met you your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell off the vine

Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said you're just a baby, maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better
Mama, shake off that dream
I told her that you were really cooking
My love is burning for a turn at the steam

Marc Broussard,"Trying in my life, trying to survive
A world away from home
Doesn't feel like I belong
Just another night alone

Like a ship out on the sea, loneliness can be
The beacon on the shore
Cannot reach me anymore
Just another night alone

Without you, I'm waiting on the dawn
Missing you, your memory lingers on
Takes me home again but baby, until then
I'll just sing this song through another night alone

The rain upon the roof
It's tapping out a tune, yeah
True and sad and clear
This harmony you never hear
Just another night alone

Without you, I'm waiting on the dawn
Missing you, your memory lingers on
Takes me home again but baby, until then

We can't pretend that I'm someone else
Try to surrender and I try to understand
I can't remember who I am

The evil things that I've done
Wash away in the warmth of your sun
The broken man that you see is not me, no
Just a shadow where I used to be

Took you for granted and I had to pay the price
I have lost you once but I won't lose you twice
You try to hold me but I, I cannot sit still
Baby, I love you and I always will

The evil things that I've done
Wash away in the warmth of your sun
The broken man that you see is not me, oh no
Just a shadow where I'll be wonderful

I'll be everything
There's a miracle in the melody of this song I sing
Will be beautiful, endless everything
You're the miracle in the melody and this song's for you

The evil things that I've done
They just wash away in the warmth of your sun
The broken man that you see is not me
Just a shadow

Hard knocks, out in the street

Can't bust through that ceiling without feeling the burn
And I ain't got nothing that I did not earn
Chasing that mighty dollar 'stead of hitting the books
Studying Donny and Stevie, learned to sail the hooks

Guessin' no one's asked you in a quite a long time

How you livin' while the world is spinnin' 'round?

Doctor's hands are tied, teacher's underpaid
We put all our worth in the money that is made
Times are changin', they're movin' so fast
Got to stick together or we ain't gonna last

We gotta fight to survive as a people
We gotta fight, fight, fight for our lives
If there's ever a time in your life
You better fight, fight, fight to survive

Well, it's dog eat dog, family livin' on the street
Daddy's beggin' for money, all he wants is a drink
Television ain't the only place to get the news
Talk to a neighbor, pay back a favour
There's someone countin' on you

We gotta fight, fight, fight for our lives

Just to get a smile from you and a kiss or two

If the feeling's right and you're feeling light

Just a touch of you, little bit of me
Might be the recipe for a real good thing

Either way baby we can't lose
But the truth is that it all comes down to me and you

Know the fellas probably want me to choose
Between hanging out with them, spending all my time with you
That's exactly what I'm gonna do if it's alright with you

Marc Broussard,"Deep in the heart of a man is a need
For someone to satisfy, someone to plead

You've got to give love to show that it's true
Saying you need me just doesn't mean we

Why do I wait till tomorrow

So many ways to spend my money on things for me
Like big gun and old guitars, nothing too much for me
She waits at home alone where I should be

When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

And I'll never have to look for love again

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh honey I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful, I got lucky with you

Sometime it takes a while
And other times it comes naturally
But I give one look at you
I knew that you were meant for me

You know I'm not gonna walk away
Be here tomorrow just like today
And I'll never have to look for love again

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh baby I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful, I got lucky with you

It's such a simple thing
But it's so beautiful
That you're mine, I'm yours

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh baby I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful

Marc Broussard,"I love your body
And the way you move your hips
Your lips are honey
You're a candy flavored kiss
Baby you're sweet 
Like a Sunday afternoon
I'm goin' crazy 'cause 
I'm crazy over you

Woo, woo, woo
Let's go to Vegas and 
We'll make love
In a heart shaped hot tub baby
So tell you're momma 
That the games up
This is real love
Let me tell ya now

What you are to me is
Only everything
Everything baby
What you are to me is
Only everything
So listen honey
Let's sit under the apple tree
And don't say anything
Kiss until the morning
'Cause what you are to me is
Only everything
Everything baby

Don't wanna wake up in 
The morning without you
Go back to bed
So I can dream about you
Look at the clock
Like I can't wait till you get home
I love to hear your message 
Playin' on my telephone

Oh you are
The only
One who can make me feel the
Way that I
Feel for you
No one can ever replace

Marc Broussard,"It's been so long since I kissed your lips
I still think about that day
Looking back
At old photographs
Baby is it wrong for me to say
That I don't feel too strong
I feel weak
I'm still here all alone
And when I fall asleep

[Chorus]
I see you when I close my eyes
And baby you're right next to me
Holding me
I feel you when I see the sun rise
I'm wondering where you could be
Cause everything has gone away
And now I'm trying so hard to make it
But I still think that saying goodbye was
Our big mistake

The scent of you
Still on your pillow
Makes me think I'm holding you
When the morning comes
I wish you were there
To wake me up the way you do
So will you pick up the phone
So I can hear you speak
I'm still here all alone
And every night I fall asleep

[Chorus]

Oh, we will both played a part
With all the things that we've done wrong
I'm not trying to ignore
But a part of me is gone
And I don't wanna feel this way anymore

[Chorus]",Our Big Mistake
Marc Broussard,"The other day we were in the yard
We had a fight and you put up your guard
You said your peace and the way it should be
I could've pleased but that ain't me
You know that I'm a man that speaks my mind
A little rough here and there is fine
But lately we've been goin' round and round
Feels like you always want the higher ground
I'm getting tired so can you be straight with me

[Chorus]
Is there something that you want me to say
Are you trying to make me see it your way
Cause there's one thing I need to understand
Do you want my love?
Do you want my love?
Or do you want a yes man?
Do you want a yes man?
Do you want a yes man?
Do you want a yes man?

Its always easier to agree
But would you lay down if you were me
Can you respect it when I speak my mind
Cause true conviction is hard to find
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong
Admitting either way is just as strong
Eating words can be food for the soul
Digging your heels will put you deep in a hole
I'm getting tired so can you be straight with me

[Chorus]

I gotta mind and it's all my own
I hope they write it on my headstone
Here lies a man that said what he meant
A heart of gold and a head of cement
I'm getting tired so can you be straight with me

Is there something that you want me to say
Are you trying to make me see it your way
Cause there's one thing I need to understand
Do you want my love?

Is there something that you want me to say
Are you trying to make me see it your way
'Cause there's one thing I need to understand

Do you want a yes man
Do you want a yes man
Do you want a yes man",Yes Man
Marc Broussard,"Tell me I'm unfaithful, if that's the way that you feel
This is going to be painful, cause it's about to get real
Telling me to be honest, how I wish I could
Cause all I ever wanted was just to be understood

I'm a rolling stone with a loaded gun
Rambling man, baby I was born to run

I didn't mean to break your heart, I'm just reckless
But the long shot love we had to begin with
I wish it didn't go down like this
My hurricane heart, you're picking up the pieces

Tired of talking it over
I said what I needed to say
You pint your finger at the sinner
I never said I'm a saint

Yeah, fell in love with a prodigal son
Rambling man, yes I am

I didn't mean to break your heart, I'm just reckless

Marc Carroll,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child,

Marc Cohn,"I got 29 ways to make it to my baby's door
I got 29 ways to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I got one through the basement
Two down the hall
And when the going gets tough
I got a hole in the wall

29 ways just to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I can come through the chimney like Santa Claus
Go through the window and that ain't all
A lot of good ways I don't want you to know
I even got a hole in the bedroom floor

29 ways to make it to my baby's door
If she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I got a way through the closet behind her clothes
A way through the attic that no one knows
A master key that fits every lock
A hidden door behind the grandfather clock

I may be here to tell some kind of story

Down the hall somewhere and I am
Lost inside a dream
Maybe I am falling
Maybe I am flying

Marc Cohn,"Down by the boathouse at Shaker Lake
When there wasn't nothing but love to make,
They were two young lovers wishing on the stars above.

Well, they carved their initials in an old birch tree
With a heart and an arrow and a 'sixty-three.
You had to be blind not to see
It was a perfect love.

It was a perfect love.     
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Well, they worked one summer together at the '64 World's Fair.
They met Robert Kennedy there.  
Well, that was
Right before the fall.

And they saved up a little bit of money for his career,
And they talked about the future underneath the giant sphere.
And all around them, the little voices were singing
It's a small world after all.  
Yes it is, small world after all.
And it was perfect love.

It was a perfect love.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
(Under the moon and stars above it was a perfect love)

Now they were dizzy from dancing on Rockaway Beach. 
They came to Rockaway.
Yeah, and everything they dreamed of was still within reach
Dreaming, dreaming as the years roll by,
Like they always do.

Well, they had their share of hard times, too.
But whatever they were, they never let it get them down.

Now, they just go walking down a country lane;
See the leaves changing in the misty rain.
And only one thing remains the same, whoa.  Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Just a perfect love			
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Marc Cohn,"Got into a cab in New York City 
Was an Oriental man behind the wheel 
Started talking about heaven 
Like it was real 
Said ""They got mansions in heaven

They're saving the best for last 
Look around this town 
And tell me that it ain't so

And you never have to listen 
To what these customers say and I know

I remember when I was a child 
Lost in the streets of Chinatown 
My mother had a vision and I was found 
(Saving the best for last for me) 
Oh-oh, saving the best for last

And when I finally take this journey
I'm gonna wave goodbye to Earth 
Gonna throw this meter in the ocean 
And prove what I was worth 
And I don't care who tries to flag me down 
They're gonna have to find another ride uptown
And I know

Marc Cohn,"Watched it coming up Winslow
Down South Park Boulevard
Yeah it was looking good from tail to hood
Great big fins and painted steel
Man it looked just like the Batmobile
With my old man behind the wheel

Well you could hardly even see him
In all of that chrome
The man with the plan and the pocket comb
But every night it carried him home
And I could hear him sayin'...

Don't gimme no Buick
Son you must take my word
If there's a God in heaven
He's got a Silver Thunderbird

You can keep your Eldorados
And the foreign car's absurd
Me I want to go down
In a Silver Thunderbird

He got up every morning
While i was still asleep
But I remember the sound of him shuffling around
Then right before the crack of dawn
I heard him turn the motor on
But when I got up they were gone

Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh the secrets that old car would know
Sometimes I hear him sayin'...",Silver Thunderbird
Marc Cohn,"There's a stranger in a car 
Driving down your street 
Acts like he knows who you are

Or are you gonna stay out?""

Might be the one they told you about 

Well you never were one for cautiousness

I'll watch my heart set sail
I'll take my trembling fingers
And I'll lift up your veil
Then I'll take you home

After ten hours on the bus.
I was staring at the stains on the ceiling, baby,

I heard it echo in the hotel shower,
I heard her start packing her things, so,
I called her number and I heard it ring...

Sometimes I just want to tell you 
We'll be all right
At least that's what some part of me believes

But you look older today 
Than I've ever seen you 
Think I know the reason 
We might wash all our tears away 
But you got to bundle up, bundle up, bundle up
For the rainy season 

Oh, oh I've been holding on so long 
Holding on and holding on so long 
Oh, oh I've been holding on so long 
Won't you bundle up baby 
Could you bundle up, bundle up, bundle up
For the rainy season",The Rainy Season
Marc Cohn,"My father was a working man 
But his work was never done 
He stood behind a counter 
And he smiled at everyone 
He bought himself a business 
Worked seven days a week 
Took a holiday for Christmas 
Then he fell asleep beside the tree 
But one day 

One day 
There's love for the lonely 
One day 
They walk in the sun 
One day 
Rest for the weary 
Rest for the weary ones 

Now my mother stood beside him 
She did what she could do 
But if you look at some old photograph
She looks tired too 
I hope there was some laughter 
Cause I know there were some tears
Now all I can say is I pray to God 
That after all those years 
After all those years 
That one day 

One day 
There's love for the lonely 
One day 
They walk in the sun 
One day 
Rest for the weary 
Rest for the weary ones 

Now I'm just another traveler 
On another winding road 
I'm trying to walk some kind of line
I'm trying to pull some kind of load 
Now sometimes I move real easy 
Sometimes I can't catch my breath 
Sometimes I see my father's footsteps
And man it scares me half to death 
But one day 

One day 
There's love for the lonely 
One day 
We walk in the sun 
One day 
Rest for the weary 
Rest for the weary ones",Rest for the Weary
Marc Cohn,"She runs down the staircase 
And into the yard 
And she goes down to the end of the drive
With her friends on the phone 
And her angels on guard 
She's just recently feeling alive 
After all of the tears and the changes 
Now there's something that's taken ahold
She's becoming gold 
She's becoming gold 

She thinks of a boy 
That she knew back in school 
And she wonders if he's doing all right 
The man of her dreams 
Isn't all that he seems 
And the baby don't sleep through the night
Something is moving inside her 
And the weather is turning so cold 
But she's becoming gold, 
She's becoming gold 
She's becoming gold (I've seen her) 
She's becoming gold 

She can hear in the distance 
The sound of the cars 
And she sees the snow falling down on the hill
Now the trees and the houses 
Are white as the stars 
And she doesn't want to cry 
But she probably will 
As she thinks about all of life's mystery 
And how slowly the answers unfold 
She's becoming gold 
She's becoming gold",She's Becoming Gold
Marc Cohn,"Don't know much about you 
Don't know who you are 
We've been doing fine without you 
But, we could only go so far 
Don't know why you chose us 
Were you watching from above 
Is there someone there that knows us 
Said we'd give you all our love 

Will you laugh just like your mother 
Will you sigh like your old man 
Will some things skip a generation 
Like I've heard they often can 
Are you a poet or a dancer 
A devil or a clown 
Or a strange new combination of 
The things we've handed down 

I wonder who you'll look like 
Will your hair fall down and curl 
Will you be a mama's boy 
Or daddy's little girl 
Will you be a sad reminder 
Of what's been lost along the way 
Maybe you can help me find her 
In the things you do and say 

And these things that we have given you 
They are not so easily found 
But you can thank us later 
For the things we've handed down 

You may not always be so grateful 
For the way that you were made 
Some feature of your father's 
That you'd gladly sell or trade 
And one day you may look at us 
And say that you were cursed 
But over time that line has been 
Extremely well rehearsed 
By our fathers, and their fathers 
In some old and distant town 
From places no one here remembers 
Come the things we've handed down",The Things We've Handed Down
Marc Cohn,"I'm writing you this letter from some old hotel
I can feel the distance between us
From the Spanish Steps to the Liberty Bell
I know the angels have seen us, seen us, baby

They see you down on Seventh Avenue
While you're just hanging by a thread
And I'm sitting in a lonely room without a view
Wishing I was there with you instead

Won't you walk through this world with me
Walk through this world?
Over the miles of mystery
Walk through this world with me

I'm staring out across the rooftops, baby
I've seen the writing on the wall
Heard a little bit of thunder at the seventh wonder
But everything is bound to rise and fall, that's all

Walk through this world with me
Walk through the world
Over the mountains and the shining sea
Walk through this world with me, walk on, walk on, walk on

Let me get this ringing out of my ears
Let me get these stars out of my eyes
'Cause I just want to look back over all the years
With you right there standing by my side.
Could you just...

Won't you walk through this world with me
Walk through this world?
Over the miles of mystery

Marc Cohn,"I can see the sunshine
Coming through my room
Breaking down the winter of my discontent
Looking out my window

At the people passing by
I keep wondering where my old companion went

On the steps of the museum
I wrote a line or two
But it took a while to find my way
Back to something true like

[Chorus]
This is where I lay my hat
This is where they know my name
This is where they show me that
A man's not so alone
Maybe I'm already home
(Sometimes you've got to go back)
Maybe I'm already home
(Sometimes you don't know why)

Rolling down the window
Burning up the daze
Cutting through the veil that keeps on blinding me
I was only sleeping
Waiting here for you
Waiting for your touch that keeps reminding me

Well I've seen the world of wonders
Been underneath it too
But it took a while just to find my way
Back to something true like

[Chorus]

Why it had to take me so long
Just to find a place that really feels
This must be where I belong
Thinking about it
All I had to do was click my heels

[Chorus]",Already Home
Marc Cohn,"I was driving down Ninth Avenue
As the sky was getting dark
Didn't have nothin' else to do
So I kept on riding to Battery Park

I stepped out in the damp and misty night
As the fog was rolling in
Man said, ""Last boat leaving tonight
Is the boat for Ellis Island""

As my feet touched solid ground
I felt a chill run down my spine
I could almost hear the sound
of thousands pushing through the lines

Mothers and bewildered wives
that sailed across the raging sea
Others running for their lives
to the land of opportunity
Down on Ellis Island

""What is this strange paradise?""
They must've wondered through their cries and moans
After all they've sacrificed
Their faith, their families, friends and homes

Then on the Inspection Stairs
They were counted out or counted in
Frozen while the inspectors stared
Down on Ellis Island

Now me I only stumbled in
Just to wander around that empty hall
Where someone else's fate had been
Decided in no time at all

And cases filled with hats and clothes
And the belongings of those who journeyed far
They're strange reminders I suppose
Of where we're from and who we are

But as the boat pulled off the shore
I could see the fog was lifting
And lights I never seen before
Were shining down on Ellis Island
Shining down on Ellis Island",Ellis Island
Marc Cohn,"I'm coming to see you, tomorrow sometimeD
Gonna bring you some roses, gonna tear
off the vines
Gonna talk to the wind that blows through the trees
Kiss you like always from down on my knees

Gonna ask you some questions, get no replies
Wipe all the tears, falling down from my eyesEm
'Cause the one that I wanted, I never could know

Gonna park in the street, gonna open the gate
Walk to the spot where you always wait
I'll be shaking my head like I usually doD
'Cause the name and the dates tell me nothing
about you

But I'll sit in the shadows and let you explain
All of the sadness and all of the painEm
Did it all seem so hopeless you just had to let go?

Yeah I'm coming to see you but I really can't wait

Like why were you hiding so much of yourself?
Why were you living for somebody else?

But I'll sit in the shadows and let you explain
All of the sadness and all of the painEm
Did it all seem so hopeless you just had to let go?

Marc Cohn,"Got your call from California
But I could hardly hear your voice
Through the hissing of the highway
And all that other noise

You said ""I might lose you in the canyon""
Then you went riding up the coast
Now all these things we leave unspoken
Seem to haunt me like a ghost

[Chorus]
I lost you in the canyon
Guess you tried to let me know
Lost you in the canyon
A long, long time ago
Lost you in the canyon
Brother you fade out slow

There were times I thought I knew you
Before these changes came to pass
But you don't think about it do you?
From up there in your house of glass

The Earth is shifting underneath you
The land is sliding all around
Do you ever stop to wonder
About that paradise you've found?

[Chorus]

I hear you moving through the mountains
Through the fires and the floods
But I can't fix this bad connection
In the wires or the blood

[Chorus]",Lost You in the Canyon
Marc Cohn,"They say my final masterpiece
Was this house upon the hill
High above the great and mighty river
My hand could not hold the brushes
Yes I guess I lost my will
And you can't keep painting paradise forever
Oh forever

From the Andes to Niagara
To where we stand today
I drew the great creations of my master
'Til the oil and the canvas
Lord I threw them all away
And traded them for stone and brick and plaster
I traded them all for you

(Winter wind blows and the river lies frozen at my feet)
I traded them all for you
(Springtime come and the river want to run above the street)

[Chorus]
She came to me one night
While I was tossing in my dreams
She said she'd give my family protection
I recall the night I died
Beneath her arches and her beams
I thanked her for the shelter and direction
I was lost until Olana

(Sun beat down on a summertime town -- he left me there)
I was lost until Olana
(Watching these hills turning gold for one more year)

Oh I've been from Jerusalem to Rome
Now I'm floating through these rooms tonight alone
And looking back on everything
All I ever wanted was a home

I was lost until Olana
How sweet the sound
How sweet the sound

They say my final masterpiece
Was this house upon the hill

[Chorus]",Olana
Marc Cohn,"I could hear the shutters banging
In my mother's house
And the wind just kept blowing off the lake
I ran down to the front door

And told the ambulance man
""Everything's all right here Sir
There must be some mistake""

[Chorus]
Saints preserve us
We're all going down
This ship is sinking in the sea
Saints preserve us
And carry us along
For we may be together in eternity

My father was staring off into another world
And my mother she was laying very still
The baby was crying
And I tried to block it out
Then from somewhere deep inside me
Came a deathly chill

[Chorus 2]
Saints preserve us
Wherever we might fall
This is all too big a mystery
I remember I was standing in the corner of the room
Saying ""Look at how she's leaving us
So quietly so soon""

And in her final hour
I saw her reaching up her hands
Like she was asking to be taken high above us
Didn't she love us?

Wherever we may fall

And carry us along",Saints Preserve Us

Come to me

Sometimes she moans, sometimes she weeps
When the wind starts a howlin' out of control
She's trouble in mind, she's nothin' but soul

Now don't feel afraid there's nothin' to fear
It?s just strange visitations year after year
She gave me somethin' I needed but now the feeling is gone
And it?s high time I told her she's gonna have to move on

From the eerie lake to the hills that shake
I've been haunted on every coast
I might miss her I know but I'm letting it go
I'm givin' up the ghost, givin' up the ghost

Last night she came in at the usual time
Twelve is the number that the church bells did chime
But the wind didn't blow, there was barely a breeze
Just a light shinin' over the sycamore trees

From the eerie lake to the hills that shake
I've been haunted on every coast
I might miss her in know but I'm letting it go
I'm givin' up the ghost, givin' up the ghost

Now feelin' much better but I'm still on the brink
I just got a letter in vanishing ink

I heard you cut your hair
Heard you got naked in a car

I cast off the very mention of the name

Is surfacing like truth and oil
All that I dreamed while underneath

Turning my head, I turn straight back to you
Surprised and teary-eyed, almost surrendering

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Marc E. Bassy,"Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
Disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

Shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

It’s just you and me

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
I know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
Yeah, we was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie, I gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window 
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So 'till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n (Eazy)

Marc Enfroy,"Look in my eyes
Can you tell?
My soul’s been taken apart
Empty and cold
Abandoned
A cast away heart

Gone with the tide
Floating adrift
Spirited away
Only a breath
Ships pass through me
Like evaporating spray

Apparition
Lost on a still ocean
Misty cloud
Barely a sound
My pale scattered light
Is fading white
Fading white

I won’t cry
I won’t miss
A home that wasn’t what it should be
Is there a place
A place to belong
Where love will recreate me?

Darkness clouds your eyes
What’s going on in your head?

Just say something
Your silence is a razor

You know I don’t deserve this
Think about everything we’ll miss
The cries of my cuts echo in the air
Hope drains from my veins
Can’t numb the pain
But why would you care?

I’m still here
You can’t ignore me forever
Just say something
Your silence is a razor
A razor
A razor

I won’t be brought to my knees while you play the saint
You’re high on your denial passing me the blame
I’ll stitch my wounds with the burning needle of my pride
And mend myself from the inside
While you let love die
You let love die

Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky

Light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans

Taxis line up like a string of pearls, around the block again

I remembered everything and every window pane
Every word came back to me and I was superman
But then I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

There's a bus that leaves at 8:15 and another one at ten
Should I climb aboard, risk everything, and ride it to the end?
Watch the hills like roller coasters up against the sky
Wish that you were here by me, so close that I could die

You said love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you tonight inside this empty dive
Till I saw your face across the street

Every word came back to me and I was superman again
Till I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

But that was just my way 
To hide all the wreckage
Ever time I drove my heart 
Right over the edge

But the river runs so fast
You're never in the same place twice
Are you still here inside my bed 
Or was it all just in my head

Crashed out in Deloraine
NY city's  blue with rain
You got my heart 
Shining like cellophane

Still those years they went like lightning
Some were thieves and some were dancing
Wrapped in over coats of heart ache

But the river runs so fast
You're never in the same place twice
Are you still here inside my bed 
Or was it all just in my head",Was It All Just In My Head

Mais cette larme sur mon visage est éternelle
Passent les nuages je les vois qui refluent
Mais cette l'arme comme ton image
Ne me quittera plus, ne me quittera plus

Certaines inclinaisons ne durent qu'une saison
Je le savais bien sûr mais le coup fait trop mal
Comme un pauvre animal
Je lèche mes blessures

Passent les nuages le dicton je le connais
Mais cette larme sur mon visage coule à jamais
Passent les nuages tes beaux yeux restent secs
Mais cette larme sera le gage de notre échec

Ce qui peut tourner mal, finit par tourner mal
C'est la loi de Murphy une triste règle dont
Nous ne feront pas l'exception
Et c'est pourquoi ma jolie

Passent les nuages le soleil point déjà
Mais cette larme sur mon visage ne sèchera pas
Passent les nuages et défilent les jours
Mais cette larme comme un tatouage
Restera toujours

Marc Lavoine,"Oui l'amour est mal coiffé,
L'amour non identifiée,
L'amour est un clandestin,

Si l'amour est voyageur,
L'amour pousse à l'intérieur
Et l'amour à toujours faim,

L'amour est mystérieux,
L'amour c'est un malheureux
Mais l'amour est un héros,

L'amour est insaisissable
Même si l'amour est cassable,
L'amour à ça dans la peau.

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là,
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

L'amour est couché par terre,
L'amour c'est un appel d'air,
L'amour est un évadé

L'amour un jour fiche le camp
Un jour l'amour te reprend,
L'amour c'est un habitué,

Que l'amour est volatil,
L'amour fait son difficile,
L'amour est un beau parleur,

L'amour nous fait ses aveux,
Mais l'amour fait ce qu'il ce veut
Comme il brisera ton cœur

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là,
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle s'est jetée sur moi

C'est comme un point de non retour,
On peut s'y perdre pour toujours,

L'amour peut devenir fou,
L'amour s'accroche à ton cou,
L'amour a le diable au corps

Car l'amour est dangereux,
L'amour c'est un ange heureux
Qui n'a pas peur de la mort,

L'amour n'est pas invincible
Mais quand il te prend pour cible,
L'amour est plus fort que toi,

L'amour couche avec la vie,
L'amour défait tous les lits,
Il aura raison de moi

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

Marc Nelson,"She left me  now beg please for my heart 
She's wants to come back to me 
Now he's gone 
You're alone 
Time to pay 'cause you did me wrong 

I was sittin' at a bar thinking 
Trying to catch myself 
Call me trippin' 
She's loving somebody else 
But I'm too cool 
To let it get me down 
'cause I knew one day 
Girl that you'll be back around 

[Chorus]  
I was wokrin' at a 9 to 5 
While he was living large 
I was bring the food to your home 
He was giving fancy cars 
Now he's telling you, you have to leave 
Sounds like the same thing you said to me 
I'm not the only fool baby 

Tell me why you're at my door 
Why could you not sec before 
Tell me what it is he said 
To make you come back to my bed 
Now tell me what 
No tell me girl 

Tell me why you're in my world 
Got togo, connot stay 
Don't you know it's too late 

[Chorus] 

I know yo've been through many changes 
And I can tell you've never loved someone before 
But baby girl, I just can't take it 
I want you back

Marc Nelson,"[Chorus] 
Baby  I understand why 
Maybe you don't think I know 
I see the stain your eyes 
I feel the pain when you cry 
Every night  but there is light 
Tonight, tonight 

Girl  I know that we have made it hard 
for you to trust a man 
and why should you give your all 
for a man to hurt you again 

Please forgive me for what we have done 
when we were once your sons 
I know that you still love us 
but we must earn your trust 
and baby

[Chorus] 

Baby when we can learn to commit 
To just once queen 
Raise out kids and learn to settle down 
Oh, the joy it would bring

But I will, because I'm willing

Marc Novoselec,"By day give thanks
By night beware
Half the world in sweetness
The other in fear

When the darkness takes you
With her hand across your face
Don't give in too quickly
Find the thing she's erased

Find the line, find the shape
Through the grain
Find the outline, things will
Tell you their name

The table. the guitar
The empty glass

All will blend together when
Daylight has passed

Find the line, find the shape
Through the grain
Find the outline, things will
Tell you their name

Now I watch you falling into sleep
Watch your fist curl against the sheet
Watch your lips fall open and your eyes dim
In blind faith

I would shelter you
Keep you in light
But I can only teach you

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Marc Ribot,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

Marc Ribot,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Do do do do do do, oh yeah

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.

A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust.

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Or where it may end

And so I threw away my frown
And I ain't gonna pick up
Something if I just put down

Marc Terenzi,"She stands alone again at night
The darkness calling her name
The light's on but there's nothing inside
She waits outside for someone to blame

She falls down on her knees
And she cries

She doesn't wanna be alone again
And the streets keep calling her name
She only has to reach out and then
She could write the rules of the game
If she could only stop the hands of time
She could change her whole damn life
She would find a paradise
To runaway

She fells a breeze and opens her eyes
She wakes up in a white bed
By the beach there's a change in the tides
Love gave her life instead

She looks up to the sky
She knows why
She doesn't wanna be alone again
And the streets keep calling her name
She only has to reach out and then
She could write the rules of the game
If she could only stop the hands of time
She could change her whole damn life
She would find a paradise
To runaway

They always told her
That this was all she could be
She once was blind
But then life taught her
How to see
She had to believe

She doesn't wanna be alone again
And the streets keep calling her name
She only has to reach out and then
She could write the rules of the game

Cause I'm standing on the corner close to hell
I'm drowning in the sands of broken time
I've drank more than my worth in gold in wine

What is left for me
Paradise is the place I could never be

Take me home tonight
Back where I belong
Before I giving up on my life
And you could make this right
Take my memories away
Of the things I never say

Tomorrow I will wake up my own
I will never feel further from my home
Long ago I knew that I could fly
Now I'm just afraid to touch the sky
What is left for me

Take me home tonight
Back where I belong
Before I giving up on my life
And you could make this right
Take my memories away
Of the things I never say

I feel like all the walls are closing in
If you could just reach out and take me by the hand
With everything you can

Take me home tonight

Before I giving up on my life

There's no jaws of the highway gonna slow me down

Sing my songs, and go real far.
I want to be a country rock star.

I grew up with the radio on,
It was AM/FM all day long.
With hopes and dreams that I would be,
Singing my songs on MTV.
I liked Guns ‘n Roses, Johnny Cash,
John Cougar Mellencamp, the Knack.
Singing oh My-My-My-My-My Sharona,
I “Hurt So Good” in a “Ring of Fire.”
“American Pie,” “I Will Survive,”
The Bee Gees sang, I was “Stayin' Alive.”

I was singing that song on the radio,
Rock on!
Had my blue suede shoes on,
Developing a little lockjaw, yee-haw!
Doing the Michael J moonwalk just for fun,
“Boot Scootin' Boogie” with Brooks and Dunn.

I was singing in the shower,
I was singing in the rain.
I was singing on the way to work in my car,
I want to be a country rock star.

Singing Air Supply, playing air guitar,
I was up on stage at a karaoke bar.
Coincidental I was feeling sentimental,
Got a little goose-bumps
From an instrumental.
Springsteen sang the “Glory Days,”
I was born in the USA.

Don't sell yourself short; don't be afraid.

My girlfriend had me over for dinner
There was nobody else around
Too bad, her mom and dad were out of town

We were watchin' Winter Wonderland
When she grabbed my hand and said
""The weather man's sayin' that the roads are all ice
I was thinkin' maybe you should stay the night""
Gee, let me think, all right

It's all there, it's a done deal
It's a looks good, it's for real
Flyin' high in a first-class seat
With the magic carpet under my feet

Life don't get any better than this
It's all that and a bag of chips
Right on par, it's the whole nine yards
A symmetrical equation, it's a perfect situation

Well, wouldn't you know I was sittin' in the front row?
Watchin' a Shania Twain
She reached down and she pulled me up
On stage and sang 'You Win My Love'

Then she passed the mic to me, I started singin'
And the crowd went crazy from the very first note
I signed a record deal and that was all she wrote
I was so stoked

It's all there, it's a done deal
It's a looks good, it's for real

Marcel Azzola,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Marcel Dadi,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind

Marcel Worms,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lagrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva
Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón

Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?

En tus ojos negros
Que me alivian todo dolor

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Marcelo D2,"1967, o mundo começou pelo menos pra mim
E a minha história reduzida é mais ou menos assim
Nascido em São Cristóvão, morador de Madureira
Desde pequeno acostumado a subir ladeira
Me lembro muito bem dos meus tempos de moleque
Que sempre passava as férias no final do 77

Padre Miguel sempre dez na bateria
Saudoso Mestre André, sempre soube o que queria
Futebol na rua F ou no campo de baixo
Você sabe, meu tio gentil era um esculacho
Andava pelas ruas vestindo o meu bate bola
Se tu passasse em minha frente era melhor tu sair fora

Carnaval de rua, perigoso e divertido
Mas passei por tudo isso entre mortos e feridos
Graças ao meu pai, o pessoal da tramela
Sérgio Cabrito, meu padrinho não dava trégua
Lembra do Cassino Bangu, de vez em quando eu ia lá
Curtir um funk, ver a mulherada rebolar
Kool and the Gang, Gap Band
Outro mestre, James Brown
Era só alegria, não tinha pau

Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Do jeito que eu fui e que eu sou
Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Que nem a parteira falou

No Andaraí, Grajaú o bicho pegava mais
Quando pichava muro sempre tinha um correndo atrás
Carlos Peixe, meu camarada
De vez em quando no piche, outras na baforada
Vida de moleque sempre sangue bom
Calote no ônibus pra ir à praia no verão

Pra ficar um pouco mais roubava no supermercado
Foda-se, pra mim isso nunca foi pecado
Sempre no Maraca vendo o Mengão jogar
Zico, Adílio, Júnior, fazendo a bola rolar
Como já dizia o hino, vou repetir com vocês
Uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer

Meu avô Peixoto deixou meu sangue rubro-negro
Me orgulho de ser carioca, me orgulho de ser brasileiro
Skate na veia, só quem tem sabe como é que é a sensação
E o poder de dar um ollie-air
Campo Grande, Norte Shopping, Street no Méier
À noite Circo Voador, show do De Falla e um Domec

Vender Camisa na 13 de Maio
Na situação show no Garage
Skunk, diversão de irmão
Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaata, Planet Rock
Rap, break, graffiti
Chegou o hip hop
Cantando a vida mas vista de um outro lado
Não é apologia, cumpadi, não adianta ficar bolado

Entenda se a minha rima não te faz rir
Não é apologia parceiro, da licença, sai daqui
Eu vim pra zoar, fazer barulho
Falar um pouco de mulher
Skate, som, bagulho
Sempre ligado, sempre sabendo o que quer
Sempre bom da cabeça, nunca doente do pé
Eu vou levando a vida
É, juro que vou
Só no sapato, sempre sendo o que sou

Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Do jeito que eu fui e que eu sou

Problemas passam como um clipe
Armas e brinquedos
Se confundem na mão de uma criança
Eu até entendo quem não tem mais esperança
É que eu vim da zona norte
Um lugar pobre
De gente honesta e humilde
Mas gente nobre
Você tem que andar na linha
Se manter no povo
Não se assuste esse é só o começo do jogo
Primeiro um flash
12 ou 13 coisas para resolver
Não dá nem tempo de pensar no que fazer
E outro flash

Mais o que cê ta disposto a perder
Quando tal paz vier ?
Quer falar de gueto ?Fala Rio de Janeiro!
De paraíso a mais sujo puteiro
Respeito a quem sobrevive a isso tudo
E não precisa mais temer o mundo
Debaixo dos planos
Ta no orgulho suburbano
Um pouco de europeu
Um pouco de africano
""Acho que fui traído""
Ah! Puro blá blá blá!
Ta na hora de levantar e lutar!
Evolução a qualquer custo ?
O dinheiro manda ?
Mas a rua vai ficar é com o samba!

Todo mundo roubando
Mais nunca vão roubar a alma de um malandro!

E não preciso abaixar minha cabeça
E nem preciso falar mau de ninguém
O que eu preciso é me focar no meu trabalho
Me focar na minha família
Que ai o meu sucesso vem!
Rema rema
E não sabe o que quer
Pra quem não sabe que caminho vai, pega um qualquer!
Me diz ai!
Vai ficar sentado no gueto
Ou vamo ser parte de algo e escrever o enredo?

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Marry and be happy till you’re old and gray

You won’t ever have to worry about the rent

Marco Antonio Muñiz,"Yo se que te han dicho
Que no valgo nada, que no valgo nada
Que vivo tan solo para los caprichos

A quién le preocupa, a quién le preocupa 
Si vivo o si muero por esta pasión

Que calle y comprenda
Que me dejen solo

Marco Antonio Muñiz,"Siento tu mano fría correr despacio sobre mi piel
Y tu pecho en mi pecho y tu desnudez
Y olvido reproches que imagine

Vente conmigo al huerto que están las rosas queriendo ver
La promesa que ha roto para volver y así creer lo que
Les conté dije que te quería como a nada en el mundo
Que seguía tus pasos tu caminar como un lobo en celo

Desde mi hogar con la puerta abierta de par en par
De par en par que tenia en penumbra nuestro rincó
En aquel salón con dos cubiertos y mi canción
Y con tus flores en el jarrón

Siento tu mano tibia que palmo a palmo besa mi piel
Y mis brazos se enredan hoy como ayer
En este nuevo día vuelvo a creer

Vente conmigo al puerto que hay una barca en el malecón
Con mi nombre pintado secando al sol con tu nombre grabado
Junto al timón sabes que te quería como a nada en el mundo
Que seguía tus pasos tu caminar como un lobo en celo

Desde mi hogar con la puerta abierta de par en par
De par en par que tenia en penumbra nuestro rincón
En aquel salón con dos cubiertos y mi canción
Y con tus flores en el jarrón

Sabes que te quería como a nada en el mundo que
Seguía tus pasos tu caminar como un lobo en celo

Desde mi hogar con la puerta abierta de par en par
De par en par que tenia en penumbra nuestro rincón
En aquel salón con dos cubiertos y mi canción
Y con tus flores en el jarrón

Quiero abrazarte tanto con mis sentidos con tanto amor
Que no haya mas sonido que el de mi voz y mi cuerpo
En el tuyo continuación y andaré en la tierra
Como un romero buscando a dios y tendrás mi regazo

Y mi comprensión y una casa pequeña para los dos sabes
Que te quiero como a nada en el mundo que seguía
Tus pasos tu caminar como un lobo en celo desde
Mi hogar con la puerta abierta de par en par

De par en par que tenia en penumbra nuestro
Rincón en aquel salón con dos cubiertos
Y mi canción y con tus flores en el jarrón

Marco Antonio Solís,"Ya que lograste deshacerte de mí 
Debo felicitarte 
Hiciste una obra de arte 
Donde tu tonto fui 

En esas noches 
Que no puedo dormir 
Entiendo tu mentira 
Y está Dios que me mira 
Por nada te perdí 

Como cambio mi vida 
Por todas esas cosas 
Las rosas más hermosas sin ti 
Nacieron sin razón 

No es fácil olvidarte 
Entre tantos recuerdos 
Mi mente lo tolera sí 
Mas no mi corazón

Es por que no me amaste 
Y eso es lo que me parte 
Pues yo creía que sí",Yo Creia Que Si

Hoy que estoy sin verte
Que suerte pues ciertamente
No se que pasó y hoy sufro
Te busco por todas esas calles
Sin parar y nada
Regreso y nuevamente y vuelvo
A confesarle a mi almohada

Que te quiero y eso no lo puedo ya ocultar por nada
Hasta cuando voy a estar sin tu amor, hasta cuando
Hasta cuando voy a estar siempre así, soportando

Antes que caiga la noche
Quiero oír tu voz
Quiero saber si aun te tengo
O nos decimos adiós

Marco Antonio Solís,"Me hace falta su presencia 
Y su luz a esta noche oscura 
Su mirada llena de aventura 
Su sentido del humor 

Que presente esta su ausencia 
Entre tanta gente y tantas cosas 
Todo parece un jardín sin rosas 
Una hoguera sin calor 

Esto es como una carita dura 
De mi vida aquí sin ella 
Vivo atado a la censura 
De no poderla abrazar 

Luna llena
Ven ayúdame con esta pena 
Dame una noche clara y serena 
Donde la vuelva a encontrar

Mendigo sonrisas, me duele hasta el aire que choca en mi
Conmigo no suenan los chistes que un día, contigo aprendí
Me muerde este frio, me matan las oras me matan
Parece que tu te llevaste contigo
Mi mundo también
Procuro otras calles pero siempre llego
A las mismas de ayer
No ahí nada que logre borrarte un minuto
De mi vida
Tengo tanto cielo pero soy un ave perdida

Extrañándote
Solo vivo extrañando tus besos y tu mirada
Extrañándote
Me quede desde el día que te fuiste
Solo extrañándote

Marco Antonio Solís,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Nada Que Me Recuerde a Ti/Dime Dónde Y Cuándo
Marco Antonio Solís,"A no estas mas a mi lado corazón 
En el alma sólo tengo soledad 
Y si ya no puedo verte 
Por qué Dios me hizo quererte 
Para hacerme sufrir mas 

Siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir 
Adorarte para mi fue religión

acentuando dia a dia
mis defectos
resaltando lo que no me sale bien
comparandome con todos

rebentando segun tu
todas mis fallas
recordandome que no voy a aprender
que me falta demasiado
para tener a mi lado una mujer
llevo
con tristeza en mi espalda tu desdicha
creo
que debemos por las buenas terminar
Si te hago tanto mal
mejor dejame tranquilo
antes que se rompa el hilo que quedo
sosteniendo lo poco que se salvo
de nuestro amor

porque le das tantas vueltas
Y te evitas ridicularizarne mas

Marco Antonio Vazquez,"Han nacido en mi rancho dos arbolitos, 
Dos arbolitos que parecen gemelos, 
Y desde mi casita los veo solitos, 
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo. 

Nunca están separados uno del otro, 
Porque así quiso Dios que los dos nacieran, 
Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen caricias, 
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran. 

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra, 
Voy a esperar que el día cansado vuelva, 
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo, 
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera. 

Arbolito, arbolito, 
Me siento solo, 
Quiero que me acompañes, 
Hasta que muera.",Dos Arbolitos
Marco Antonio Velázquez,"Veras que no he cambiado estoy enamorado tal vez igual que ayer 
Quiza te comentaron que a solas me miraron llorando tu querer 
Y no me da verguenza que aun con la experiencia que la vida me dio 
A tu amor yo me aferro y aunque ya no lo tengo no te puedo olvidar 
A tu amor yo me aferro y aunque ya no lo tengo no te puedo olvidar

De que manera te olvido,de que manera yo entierro 
Este cariño maldito que a diario atormenta a mi corazon 
De que manera te olvido si te miro en cualquier gente 
Y tu no quieres ni verme por que te conviene callar nuestro amor

Marco Borsato,"Io non posso stare fermo con le mani nelle mani
Tante cose devo fare prima che venga domani
E se lei già sta dormendo io non posso riposare
Farò in modo che al risveglio non mi possa più scordare
Perché questa lunga notte, non sia nera più del nero
Fatti grande dolce luna e riempi il cielo intero
E perché quel suo sorriso possa ritornare ancora
Splendi sole domattina come non hai fatto ancora

E per poi farle cantare, le canzoni che ha imparato
Io le costruirò un silenzio che nessuno ha mai sentito
Sveglierò tutti gli amanti, parlerò per ore ed ore
Abbracciamoci più forte, perché lei vuole l'amore

Poi corriamo per le strade e mettiamoci a ballare
Perché lei vuole la gioia, perché lei odia il rancore
E poi coi secchi di vernice coloriamo tutti i muri
Case, vicoli e palazzi, perché lei ama i colori
Raccogliamo tutti i fiori, che può darci primavera
Costruiamole una culla, per amarci quando è sera
Poi saliamo su nel cielo, e prendiamole una stella
Perché Margherita è buona, perché Margherita è bella

Perché Margherita è dolce, perché Margherita è vera
Perché Margherita ama, e lo fa una notte intera
Perché Margherita è un sogno, perché Margherita è il sale
Perché Margherita è il vento e non sa che può far male
Perché Margherita è tutto, ed è lei la mia pazzia

Marco Borsato,"Kan iemand me vertellen
Wanneer een schutter rust
Wanneer de boog zich mag ontspannen
Z'n pijl het laatste doelwit kust

Wanneer is een mens tevreden
Merkt hij voor een keer als hij kijkt
Over de schutting van de buren
Dat 't het gras net iets groener lijkt

Zeg me waar moeten we zoeken
En wat is nou die wens
Waarna we niet meer verder hoeven
Waar en wanneer ligt die grens

En waarom wil ik alsmaar verder
Als ik ergens ben
Wat maakt het onbekende beter
Dan al hetgene dat ik ken

Waarom moet er toch steeds weer iets bij
Waarom nooit eens een keer

van mijn gevoel voor jou
Wat nu alleen nog puin is
was ooit een groot gebouw

van wat hier heeft gestaan
zijn na wat mooie lentes
al min of meer vergaan

zo verloren we de kamers
van ons eigen luchtkasteel
zelf geloopt met grote hamers
en nu is er niets meer heel

Is dit het huis waar we kusten
waar we feesten en rustten
Is dit de plek waar we vreeën

vier straten verder wonen

dan komen ze nog aan

dacht je hoogstwaarschijnlijk elke keer aan hem

ik heb bewusteloos naast jou in bed gelegen
en ik heb niet eens een aarzeling gevoeld
toen ik je lichaam zonder passie zag bewegen
omdat je passie voor een ander was bedoeld

het ontbreekt me aan de moed om jou te vragen
of die ander tussen ons is in gaan staan
ook al voel ik mij vernederd en verraden
ik ben doodgewoon te bang dat je zult gaan

ik heb met m'n ogen dicht naar jou gekeken
en ik weet niet meer of ik je nog wel ken
want mijn zekerheid is voor de angst geweken
dat ik eigenlijk een vreemde voor je ben

Marco Borsato,"Rood is al lang het rood niet meer
Het rood van rode rozen
De kleur van liefde van weleer
Lijkt door de haat gekozen

Dat mooie rood was ooit voor mij
Een kleur van passie en van wijn
Ik wil haar terug, die mooie tijd
Maar zij lijkt lang vervlogen

En alle beelden op TV
Van bloed en oorlog om ons heen
Werken daar ook niet echt aan mee

Dus ik neem heel bewust het besluit
De krant leg ik weg
En de TV gaat uit

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Ik loop de deur door en naar buiten waar de zon begint te schijnen
Laat alles achter, kijk vooruit en met mijn laatste rooie cent
Koop ik een veel te grote bos met hondervijftig rode rozen
Een voor elk jaar waarvan ik hoop dat jij nog bij me bent.

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

En nu sta je hier zo voor me
De rode avondzon streelt jouw gezicht
Je bent een wonder voor me
Denk ik, terwijl een doorn mijn vinger prikt

Rood is mijn bloed dat valt op de grond
En even lijk ik verloren
Maar jij brengt mijn vingers naar je mond
En je kust ze
En ik weet


Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Vandaag? is rood
Gooi de loper uit
En drink een goed glas wijn
Pluk de dag want het kan zo ineens de laatste zijn
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jouw en mij

Vandaag staat rood weer voor de liefde
Tussen jou en mij
",Rood
Marco Borsato,"De blik in haar ogen
Verandert de kleur van mijn dag
'T is niet te geloven
Van zwart als ze boos is
Tot blauwer dan blauw als ze lacht

De zon hangt voortdurend verliefd om haar heen
De maan laat haar nooit een seconde alleen
Een woord van haar lippen
Kan telkens weer wonderen doen
'T is niet te voorspellen
Soms klinkt ze als onweer
En soms als een zonnig seizoen

Maar hoe hard het ook vriest
Ze is zo weer ontdooid
Zolang ze bij mij is verveel ik me nooit

Want zij
Zij is de zon en de maan voor mij
Zij is het beste van allebei
Zo mysterieus en zo warm tegelijk
En ze doet iets met mij
Ze is vrij

Vrij om te gaan maar ze blijft bij mij
Zij is de eb en de vloed erbij
Ze is onweerstaanbaar
Ze zegt me gewoon wat ze vindt
Een vrouw en een kind
Ze is wind en windstilte
En zij
Zij hoort bij mij

En zij opent een wereld voor mij
Zij is de zon op m'n huid en de regen
Wind mee en wind tegen
Zij zit in alles voor mij
Ze maakt me blij

Zij houdt me vast maakt me vrij
Zij is er altijd
Ja, zij maakt me deel van haar grote geheel
Zij is de betere helft
Van mij

Zij

Ze slaat haar vleugels uit
De vogels komen dichterbij
Maar jij hoort geen geluid

Je voelt alleen de pijn

de bomen laten hun bloesem vrij
De geur die wordt verspreid
Het doet je niet zoveel

Je ziet lentesneeuw

je richt je blik naar boven
Je vraagt je af waarom
Je ziet dan veel te lang geen licht

Marco Carta,"Buongiorno mia signorina
Le posso offrire un caffè
Viaggio da questa mattina
In cerca di lei

Vedo l'azzurro del mare
Nei suoi occhi così blu
Sintomi di un grande amore
Io vorrei darle del tu

Vorrei farti sognare, portarti a ballare
Stringerti tanto da non respirare
Perdermi in ogni minimo particolare di te

Dentro ad ogni brivido
C'è la magia di un timido
Incontro di due mani che si sfiorano
Semplicemente un'alchimia
Che già ti fa sentire mia
Come vorrei

E mi sento stupido
Nella follia di un attimo
Mi sono immaginato tutto quanto
E intanto tu rimani lì
Seduta a bere il tuo caffè
Senza di me
Senza di me

Buongiorno mia signorina
Le posso offrire un caffè
Viaggio da tutta la vita
In cerca di lei

C'è l'infinito del mare
In quei suoi occhi così blu
E' certamente già amore
Ed io vorrei darle del tu

Potrei stare a guardare, bramarti per ore
Baciarti tanto da non respirare
Perdermi in ogni minimo particolare di te

Dentro ad ogni brivido
C'è la magia di un timido
Incontro di due mani che si sfiorano
Semplicemente un'alchimia

Marco Carta,"Aprire gli occhi e ritrovarti qui
È come aprire una finestra al sole
È l'emozione del salto nel vuoto che mi porta da te
Aprire gli occhi e ritrovarti qui
È risvegliarsi mani nelle mani
È un bacio ad acqua salata che ancora più sete di te mi da
Quando tutto sembrava ormai spento
Nel mio mondo cercavo te
Quando tutto sembrava finito guardando il fondo
Invece ho sentito che
Tu sarai la forza mia
La mia strada il mio domani
Il mio sole la pioggia
Il fuoco e l'acqua dove io mi tufferò
Tu sarai la forza mia
Il mio gancio in mezzo al cielo
Il colpo al cuore
Sarai all'improvviso dentro me
Dentro me

Aprire gli occhi e ritrovarsi qui
Lasciarsi andare sotto il temporale
Sentire come mi manca il respiro
Se I tuoi occhi accendono I miei
Quando tutto sembrava ormai spento
Nel mio mondo volevo te
Quando tutto sembrava finito
Toccando il fondo invece ho sentito che
Tu sarai la forza mia
La mia strada il mio domani
Il mio sole e la pioggia
Il fuoco e la goccia dove io mi tufferò
Tu sarai la forza mia
Il mio gancio in mezzo al cielo
Il colpo al cuore
Il paradiso dentro me

Ballando tacchi a spillo tra la pioggia
E ti ho incontrata all'improvviso,
La tua macchina non parte
""mi scusi può venire ad aiutarmi""
Tu mi hai baciato dopo un' attimo, come se non fosse niente
Come prendere un caffè mentre io muoio

Quella ferita che non so guarire,
La cioccolata che mi fa godere
O forse l'uva a cui non so arrivare

Visto il dolore che mi fai provare
Delle mie vite tu la peggiore
Proprio per questo sei fondamentale

Non ero io che interrompevo il senso delle cose
La prepotenza perde di coerenza,
Non ero io che cancellavo una vita scritta a mano,
Giocando tra due gocce di profumo

In balia di te questa è la mia situazione

Fare finta di niente
Soffocare tutte le tentazioni

Solo per noi
Questa è una favola moderna

Cada lugar, cada rincón
Mi locura y mi razón

A partir de hoy te digo que te amo
Que no puedo estar sin ti porque te extraño
Es para ti todo mi amor
Todo de mi, a partir de hoy",A  Partir De Hoy
Marco Figueira,"Um cantinho e um violão
Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado (Quiet Nights)

Quiero comerte tus labios y que tus manitas no me dejen ir
Déjalo todo en mis manos chiquitita que te voy a consentir

Esas babitas de guayaba
Me vuelven loco cuando te beso
Cuando nos arremangamos y de lo excitada me muerdes el cuello
Cuando me muerdes los labios y me estás hablando no te entiendo nada
Cuando tu lengüita pasa por mi boca dándome una saboreada
Hay te va tu serenata mamacita

Esas babitas de guayaba se me secaron en todo mi cuerpo
A que ricas mordiditas, estrujadas y jalones de cabello
No te quejes de la forma que me estas saciando ya perdí el sentido

Marco Masini,"Ti vorrei nel chewin-gum
Mentre vado a lavorare in tram
Ti vorrei solo al bar
Ti vorrei come una mamma al C.A.R.
Ti vorrei dentro I jeans
Quarta donna del mio triste tris
Ti vorrei con la ""V""
Ti vorrei che non ne posso più.
Nel letto insoddisfatto io ti vorrei
Mentre accarezzo il gatto io ti vorrei
Quando la notte spegne tutto
E distrutto io mi butto in questi sogni miei
Ti vorrei, ti vorrei
Ti vorrei anche se fossi un gay
Ti vorrei, ti vorrei
Non lo senti quanto ti vorrei?
Ti vorrei perchè spesso ho paura di me
Nel riflesso di un abito senza te
Perchè sei quel che si
Ma lo stesso vorrei...
Ti vorrei perchè il mondo non ha pietà
Perchè intorno see'è odio e banalità
E gli amici non bastano mai e neanche lei
Ti vorrei!
In questa grande noia io ti vorrei
Prima che il sogno muoia io ti vorrei
Anche per una volta sola
La mia vela che si svela
Dentro gli occhi tuoi.
Ti vorrei ti vorrei
E anche l'anima mi venderei
Ti vorrei ti vorrei
Non lo senti quanto ti vorrei?
Ti vorrei pechè ho un gran bisogno di te
Della voglia di vivere che non see'è
Perchè sei quel che sei
Ma lo sai che vorrei
Ti vorrei perchè il cuore non ce la fa
Fra le stelle e il rumore della città
E gli amori non bastano mai mentre ti vorrei
Ti vorrei
Non lo senti quanto ti vorrei.

",Ti Vorrei
Marco Masini,"Zero niente novità e di lavora faccio l'angolo di un bar
Con un cappotto pesante e leggero con un futuro da cani bastardi
Zero donne zero soldi zero amici zero sguardi
Zero palle zero pugni zero stelle zero sogni

Ero prima di esser me il novemiladuecentotrentatre
Avevo casa bollette e patente avevo un corpo ma dentro non see'ero
E ora sono trasparente non più bianco non più nero
Sconosciuto al mittente finalmente zero zero

Zero e chi si muove più se anche l'amore è un noioso su e giù
E tu ragazza col sole tra I denti e un assorbente al posto del cuore
Tu che a letto davi I punti e mi tenevi prigioniero
Fra le gambe I sentimenti ma per te contavo zero

Non mi piacciono I perdenti voglio un uomo più sicuro
Che è nel giro dei potenti quelli che ce l'hanno duro

Sì tutti numeri uno e va bene così
Tutti in centro a Milano e nessuno che aiuta nessuno ma io
Sono amico di un treno che passa di qui
E mi porta ogni giorno il profumo del mare e un vestito da zero

Zero è una malattia che non si viene più neanche in fotografia
In questo mondo di ricchi panini
Come granelli di umana polenta
Forse siamo dei bambini in piscine di placenta
Siamo gli ultimi dei primi perchè il mondo non rallenta

Sì tutti numeri uno ma senza di me
Come fate a far dieci a far cento a far mille
Miliardi da zero...

Senza gli zero
Chi se ne frega dell'acqua e sapone
Voglio una vita di barba e pensiero
Voglio un grande scatolone che si vede solo il cielo
E una doccia di acquazzone tanto il sole asciuga e costa zero.

",Zero
Marco Masini,"Tu zitta fra le lacrime ha fatto tutto lui
ubriaco come al solito padrone più che mai
un padre senza l'anima che mangia un po' di sé
e ha crocifisso l'angelo che see'era dentro te
e ora asciughi i tuoi occhi alla sottana
dolce figlia di un figlio di puttana
Non devi dirlo al parroco e forse neanche a Dio
ma devi sotterrartelo nel cuore amore mio
perciò stanotte chiuditi a chiave dentro te
e domattina aspettami ti porto via con me
Lasceremo su questo mondo infame
le carezze al fratellino ed al tuo cane
Vieni principessa ti porto via con me
ci sarà in questo mondo di merda
una rosa rossa da cogliere per te
e domeniche e sogni sull'erba
ci sarà un lavoro e il caldo di una stanza
e ogni giorno almeno un piatto di sperata speranza
Vieni principessa ti porto via con me
questo mondo di fame e violenza finirà
Avevo un serramanico ma l'ho buttato via
in fondo a una discarica venendo a casa tua
e lì see'è nato un albero cresciuto come noi
sotto i due grandi noccioli che sono gli occhi tuoi
e ora dentro non see'è odio né vendetta
ma una foglia che vuol essere difesa e protetta
Vieni principessa ti porto via con me
fra le stelle di un altro pianeta
dove non see'è il grasso e maledetto re
che ti ha dato e ti ha preso la vita che see'è in te
dove il male non ti guarda e non ti tocca
e il sorriso vola ancora al nido della tua bocca
Vieni principessa ti porto via con me
fra le stelle di un altro pianeta
see'è un rosa rossa da cogliere per te
e domeniche e sogni di vita
vieni principessa ti porto via con me...

Marco Masini,"Raccontami di te se hai ancora voglia di parlare
Un po' di verità stasera non può farmi male
Aiutami così almeno a non dimenticare
La vita che 'cause'è raccontami raccontami di te
Di come riesci a respirare.

Questi giorni soffocati dalla solita allegria
Vuoti a perdere sui prati che la gente butta via
Questo tempo senza tempo che non ci accarezza mai
Dentro a un labirinto di cemento questa fabbrica di eroi!

Raccontami di te da quando mi hai lasciato solo
Soffrendo più di me spiccando il volo verso un'altra te
Teneramente forte come sei insegnami
A non vergognarmi mai di innamorarmi dell'amore.

Raccontami di te se sei riuscita a perdonare
Tuo padre che non see'è non piangere raccontami di te
Di come riesci a sopportare.

Questi eterni fallimenti di ogni splendida utopia
La processione dei rimpianti nel freddo dell'ipocrisia
Questo vivere aspettando che qualcosa cambierà
In questo indifferente girotondo oltre questa libertà!

Raccontami di te adesso che ti sei sposata
Di quanta vita see'è in quel bambino che assomiglia a te
Perdutamente bella come sei da questo sogno
Non svegliarti mai lo sai quanto ti voglio bene.

La tua felicità è un treno in corsa verso il mare
Tu vivila per me amore mio raccontami di te.

Marco Masini,"Che giorno è
Ti stai annoiando di te
Che parli cinicamente
Niente vale niente
Ti vedo ma sei assente
Quasi trasparente
Dimmi che giorno è
Ti stai stufando anche te
Di non avere un posto
Un sogno che è rimasto
E non sentire il gusto
Del sole a ferragosto
E no così non va
Non stiamo mica giocando
Con questa eternità, l'eternità

Vivere cadere vivere e rialzarsi vivere

Come la prima volta

Riconquistarsi

Di vivere che giorno è
Che giorno è

Se ti accontenti di te
Se resti ancora a ieri
A tutti quei desideri

Ma sempre e solo da domani
E invece è tutto qua, è qua
E' come un appuntamento
Con la casualità

Vivere cadere vivere e rialzarsi vivere
Ricominciare

Dimmi che è il giorno perfetto, sì
Per ritrovarci già, trovarti qua
E riniziare a vivere
Io e te

Marco Masini,"Mi fischiano le orecchie, forse stai parlando di me
Dall'altro lato della lontananza
Se male o bene non lo so, però mi fischiano le orecchie
Forse stai pensando di me
Ma sono qui all'altro capo di un filo
Che ancora stringo e che non lascio andare
Io no, cercando l'uscita di quel labirinto
Che ho costruito per non farmi trovare
Qui conto le volte che ho perso e che ho vinto
Ma il filo non lo lascio andare

E vivo a intermittenza
Con questo sole in faccia e dentro un'altra pioggia
Di piccole amnesie, progetti più importanti
E nuove nostalgie negli attimi incoerenti
E il tempo non rallenta e lascia nelle tasche l
E note di passaggio
Potevo fare meglio e dovrei fare meglio
Tutte le volte che dico oramai

Dovrei scappare adesso e invece resto immobile qui
Ad osservare le mie mani calde, superflue senza la tua faccia
Lì in mezzo e forse stanchezza o è suggestione
La sete che ho adesso di semplicità, di occhi negli occhi
Semplice e pelle su pelle, semplice
 
E vivo a intermittenza
Con questo sole in faccia e dentro un'altra pioggia
Di facili risposte per scomode domande
Con le unghie sugli specchi qualcosa poi si perde
Si corre per distrarsi, si corre per salvarsi o solo per stancarsi
Si corre per paura a volte per coraggio ma resto senza fiato

E troppo lungo il viaggio
Ti immagino così
Nel punto esatto dov'è la tua vita
Dall'altra parte di un volo
Che non so fare io in questa splendida scatola vuota
All'altro capo di un filo

E vivo a intermittenza
Con questo sole in faccia e dentro un'altra pioggia
Di nuove ipocrisie, affetti virtuali
In cerca di altre idee in questi giorni uguali
E il tempo non rallenta e lascia sulla strada
Le tracce mai seguite
Potevo fare meglio e dovrei fare meglio
Tutte le volte che dico ormai

Mi fischiano le orecchie, forse stai parlando di me
Che resto qui all'altro capo di un filo che ancora stringo
E che non lascio andare",All'altro capo di un filo

Di levarci pure il gusto
Di provare di sbagliare e intanto esistere
E ci hanno detto stai lì, quello è il tuo posto
Ma tutto il mondo è già il posto mio

Guardiamoci negli occhi un'altra volta
Non è tempo di aspettare nuove verità
Se una goccia cambia il senso del mare
Voglio scegliere adesso, voglio scegliere adesso
E non basta l'astuzia

La bugia di un re nudo
Per nascondere lo sporco coi tappeti
Forse questo non è il tempo che sognavi di abitare
Però questo è il solo tempo che hai per vivere
Ci hanno divisi così
Buoni e cattivi
Ma ognuno cerca di usare Dio
 
Guardiamoci negli occhi un'altra volta
Non è tempo di aspettare nuove verità
Se una nota cambia il suono del coro
Voglio scegliere adesso, voglio scegliere adesso

E ora che verranno giorni di fatiche da intrecciare
Con un filo resistente di condivisione
E non servirà giudizio e nemmeno la saggezza
Benvenuta l'impazienza benvenuta la follia
E diranno che è uno sbaglio
Che è soltanto un'illusione
Che dovremmo dare ascolto a chi ne sa molto di più
Ma sorrideremo forte quando arriverà domani
Quella goccia che contiene l'universo
Sei tu, sei tu, sei tu

lascia stare, io non darò soddisfazione
a un'altra cosa che alla fine è solo non amare me

Perché mi sentirei sconfitto a non seguire ciò che sento
tu che cosa mai ti aspetti? lo segui mai il vento?
per quelle volte che ho educatamente sorvolato
per non dire anche a me stesso che non avrei sbagliato

E ho scoperto che cadere fa male
Nel primo schiaffo ho capito il pianto
E che se è non strettamente vitale non si deve rubare
Ho scoperto che l’amore è un’arte da capire
E l’ho scoperto così semplicemente amando
Che tutto cambia mentre lo stai vivendo
E che alcune cose si allineano a stento
Si allineano a stento

Un’altra volta indietro e ritrovarmi nudo
E ritrovar la voglia di riempire ogni vuoto
E fare tutto di nuovo, fare tutto di nuovo
Di nuovo, un attimo dopo

E adesso vorrei sapere
Come sarebbe il mondo
Se tutto quanto fosse
Spostato di un secondo
Adesso ti vedrei
Scegliere di restare
E invece te ne vai
E io, io ti lascio andare

Io che con la nicotina non ho fatto pace
Vorrei tornare lì per non provare nemmeno
Vedere da grande come diventa una voce
Se non la vizi con trent’anni di veleno
Io che da sempre le considerazioni
E se sei segnato è dalle tue azioni e dalle onde del mare
Poi uno sconosciuto fa sentire una canzone
E riparte dal suo nome per ricominciare

E adesso vorrei sapere
Come sarebbe il mondo
Se tutto quanto fosse
Spostato di un secondo
Adesso ti vedrei

E invece te ne vai

Negli stessi posti
Magari un po’ più avanti

Mi sveglio, mi guardo allo specchio e mi vedo un disastro
Sarà stato un brutto sogno che vomiti al mattino e passa tutto
Passa come una sbronza, con un mal di testa che ti spacca
Ma almeno stavolta non è colpa mia

Perché tu, tu non esisti
Altrimenti saresti qui con me adesso
A parlare, scherzare, a fare l'amore, guardare un film, rifare l'amore
Più forte ancora, fino a nasconderci dal tempo e

Sarebbe stato intelligente come te
O magari stronzo come me
Chissà, ma adesso cosa importa, adesso negheresti

Togli pure quelle 
E lascia solo questo inverno

E gli errori sono umani, ma le tue mani sono errori 
Che ho commesso e non mi pento
Perché preferisco piangere che rimpiangere
E stavolta non è colpa mia
Perché tu, tu non esisti

Per trovare una goccia, soltanto, e un po' di senso a questa vita
Incasinata e fuori moda

O magari chiedere uno sconto e tu

Su una dura salita
Hai speso I tuoi anni a studiare le carte
Ma non ricordi la meta
E devi tornare di nuovo all'inizio
E perdere tutto
Se non è concesso cambiare il passato
Proviamo ad amarlo

Se ti raggiungerai
In un destino fuori dal presente
Se ti cercherai
In un dettaglio che non è importante

Di far la guerra e ambire poi alla pace
E nel silenzio mio
Annullo ogni tuo singolo dolore

Per apprezzare quello che
Non ho saputo scegliere

E mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Che da sempre sei per me l’essenziale

Non accetterò
Un altro errore di valutazione
L’amore è in grado di
Celarsi dietro amabili parole

Che ho pronunciato prima che
Fossero vuote e stupide

Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te

Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Mi allontano dagli eccessi e dalle cattive abitudini
Tornerò all’origine
E torno a te, che sei per me l’essenziale

L’amore non segue le logiche
Ti toglie il respiro e la sete

Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te

Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Mi allontano dagli eccessi e dalle cattive abitudini
Tornerò all’origine
E torno a te, che sei per me l’essenziale",L' Essenziale

Sai che musica è il rumore? 
Sai che cosa c'è? Sto bene

Se è concesso

Lascio al tempo le promesse
Lascio a te le tue certezze

I versi che non hai mai scritto

Non ti chiederò permesso
Preferisco bruciarmi da solo
Che assecondarti adesso

Dove sei? In che parte del mondo? 
Oppure sei ancora qui e non me ne accorgo
Troverai l'equilibrio che cerco
Oppure lo scoprirai in ogni dubbio che sei 
Non vorrei, non vorrei
Ma che fretta hai di capire cosa siamo noi? 

Non ti resta che il rumore
Io che non so dargli un nome
E il tuo cuore scivoloso
Non mi resta che poterci pattinare pattinare 

Tu in un angolo sola 
E io non ti riconosco

Dove sei? In che parte del mondo? 
Oppure sei ancora qui e non me ne accorgo

Di capire cosa siamo noi 
Di capire cosa siamo noi

Marco Mengoni,"A questo incrocio
Dimmi dove si va
Con un passo in più.
Tu che forse un po’
Hai scelto di già
Di non amarmi più.
E come quadri appesi
Leve senza pesi
Che non vivono.
Come quando c’era
Una vita intera
Due che si amano.

E salgo ancora in alto perché
È lì che c’eri tu.
Ma ora serve il coraggio per me
Di guardare giù.
E non c’è niente che resiste
Al mio cuore quando insiste
Perché so che tu non passerai mai,
Che non passerà
(Non passerai)
Non mi passerai
(Non passerai)

Ok allora adesso confesso
Non avevo che te.
Come faccio a vivere adesso
Solo, senza te?
E senza I tuoi sorrisi
E tutti I giorni spesi
Oggi che non c’è.
E che è una porta chiusa e
Nessun’altra scusa da condividere.

E salgo ancora in alto perché
È lì che c’eri tu.
Ma ora serve il coraggio per me
Di guardare giù.
E non c’è niente che resiste
Al mio cuore quando insiste
Perché so che tu non passerai mai,
Che non passerà
(Non passerai)
Non mi passerai
(Non passerai).

E quanto amore mancherà
E troppo rumore in un giorno
Che non va.
E non posso comprendere
Che non passerà.

E salgo ancora in alto perché
È lì che c’eri tu.
Ma ora serve il coraggio per me
Di guardare giù.
E non c’è niente che resiste

Perché so che tu non passerai mai,
Che non passerà

Marco Mengoni,"Con te ero immobile 
Oggi ti vedrò di colpo sparire 
Fra la folla te ne andrai 
Mi sono rotto delle scuse 
E sono stanco dei tuoi guai 
Hai detto che non vuoi più 
Camminare accanto a me, accanto a me 
Ora questa casa mi sembra più grande 
Illumino ogni angolo 
Dipingo la noia, rivesto la stanza 
Di quel che d'ora in poi sarò 
Non mi fermerai né adesso, né mai 
Perché per troppe volte ho scelto te 
Non sono immobile 
Grazie per avermi fatto male, non lo dimenticherò 
Grazie io riparto 
Solo controvento ricomincerò 
Giro nel centro e faccio la spesa 

Non mi sento fragile 
Cento grammi di sole 
Non serve l'amore 
Se poi diventa cenere 
Non mi prenderai 
Né adesso, né mai 
Perché per troppo tempo 
Ho scelto te 
Dimenticando me 
Grazie per avermi fatto male 
Non lo dimenticherò 
Grazie io riparto 
Solo controvento ricomincerò 
Sarò pronto a correre per me

Marco Mengoni,"Da quando ci sei tu
La luce del mattino ha più colori
E non mi sento più
Un piccolo silenzio fra rumori
Dell'amore non so niente
Conosco solo te
Sei il confine della mia pelle e al di là
Io penso che di più non c'è

Anche se non puoi tu sorridimi
Sono pochi, sai, i miracoli
Riconoscerei le tue mani in un istante
Ti vedo ad occhi chiusi e sai perché
Fra miliardi di persone ad occhi chiusi hai scelto me

Da quando ci sei tu
Non sento neanche i piccoli dolori
Ed oggi non penso più
A quanto ho camminato per trovarti 
Resto solo adesso mentre sorridi e te ne vai
Quanta forza che mi hai dato non lo sai e spiegarlo non è facile

Anche se non puoi tu sorridimi
Sono pochi, sai, i miracoli

Marco Mengoni,"Le cose che non ho
Sono come te
Ti assomigliano un pò
Sono bellissime
Mentre guido piano verso casa
In compagnia di una radio accesa
C’è una canzone che riempie l’aria della sera

Le cose che non ho
Radici e nuvole
E lì in mezzo ci sei tu
Da qualche parte
A volte un nome sulle labbra appese
Anche se più leggero di una piuma
Quando il suono di una felicità che si consuma
La mia vita è sempre uguale
Sembra calma come me
Appena sotto la superficie c’è tutto quello che ho di te
E so che non si torna indietro mai
Lo so io, lo sai tu
Ma se dovessi cambiare idea, io sarò qui

Le cose che non ho, ragioni e regole
Neanche il cuore adesso sa che cosa fare
Avrei voluto regalarti i miei sogni
E farti ridere fino a stancarti
Ti avrei difesa dai dispiaceri con le mie mani
La mia vita è sempre uguale
Sembra calma come me
Appena sotto la superficie c’è tutto quello che ho di te
E so che non si torna indietro mai

Anche se a volte lascio dietro
Un po' più di luce
Su quella scia io traccerò

In equilibrio anche in bilico
Il vuoto sembra ancor più logico

Le usi adesso come scudi

Sopporta il peso delle nuvole

Marco Mengoni,"Così sono partito per un lungo viaggio
Lontano dagli errori e dagli sbagli che ho commesso
Ho visitato luoghi
Per non doverti rivedere
E più mi allontanavo
E più sentivo di star bene
E nevicava molto
Però
Io camminavo
A volte ho acceso un fuoco per il freddo e ti pensavo
Sognando ad occhi aperti
Sul ponte di un traghetto
Credevo di vedere dentro il mare
Il tuo riflesso
Le luci dentro al porto
Sembravano lontane
Ed io che mi sentivo
Felice di approdare
E mi cambiava il volto
La barba mi cresceva
 
Trascorsi giorni interi senza dire una parola
E quanto avrei voluto in quell'istante che
Ci fossi
Perché ti voglio bene veramente
E non esiste un luogo dove non mi torni in mente
Avrei voluto averti veramente
E non sentirmi dire
Che non posso farci niente
Avrei trovato molte più risposte
Se avessi chiesto a te
Ma non fa niente 
Non posso farlo ora che sei così lontana
 
Mi sentirei di dirti
Che il viaggio cambia un uomo
E il punto di partenza
Sembra ormai così lontano
La meta non è un posto
Ma è quello che proviamo
E non sappiamo dove
Nè quando ci arriviamo

Trascorsi giorni interi senza dire una parola
Credevo che fossi davvero lontana
Sapessimo prima di quando partiamo
Che il senso del viaggio é la meta e il richiamo
Perché ti voglio bene veramente
E non esiste un luogo dove non mi torni in mente
Avrei voluto averti veramente
E non sentirmi dire che non posso farci niente
Avrei trovato molte piú risposte

Cancelleremo i perchè

Attraverso il cielo
Giuro sarò roccia contro il fuoco e il gelo

Ti difenderò da incubi e tristezze
Ti riparerò da inganni e maldicenze
E ti abbraccerò per darti forza sempre

Ti darò certezze contro le paure

Non temere nulla io sarò al tuo fianco
Con il mantello asciugherò il tuo pianto

E resterò al tuo fianco fino a che vorrai
Ti difenderò da tutto, non temere mai

Ti darò riparo contro le tempeste
E ti terrò per mano per scaldarti sempre

Devo dirti che
Per sempre può durare solo un'ora

Perché si può cambiare direzione
Una casa, un letto
I sogni cambiano regista ma
Ora siamo qua, tu
Mi chiedi cos'è
La neve un po' prima che cada
Non è come noi
Che siamo due piume nell'aria

Questo cuore ha
È vulnerabile, lo sai

Anche se il duro fa
Non siamo quelli che promettono l'eternità
Perché si può cadere in tentazione

Mi chiedi cos'è

Che siamo parole nell'aria

What's up Brooklyn?
Filthy rich

People in the audience, Masta Ace the name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your vein
They run through your bloodstream, get inside your brain
'Cause I first put my name up inside the train
My mic control has been unprecedented
And you wrong if you thought you was the best that did it
See I just started messing with it, I been married to the game since '88
You just committed
The entire fate of the whole Empire States
Into hands of a man that's here to inspire hate
Hate for the state of the music
And all these other cats looking for another way to abuse it
I wake you up like a gun in the face
I'm just here to let you know who's like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know

""This is for those that don't know the half""
""Backtrack turn back the page""
""Let me show y'all new rappers""
""That's how the game go""
""This is for those that don't know the half""

""Don't be missing any word I say""

You love to hear the story, again and again
How it all got started from beginning to end
When cats used to run in a pack and slaughter
The rooftop, Union Square and the latin quarter
And if you came alone then your chain was gone
Unless you was from the hood and your name was known (Yup)
And even then you was taking a risk
They would rush you for your chain while you was taking a piss
Hip hop used to be so thick in the air
When it was there you ain't even need a kick and a snare
It could have been finger snaps and hand claps
But nowadays it feels a little different when a man raps
The track commence and these cats are french
The media lacking sense, what I rap's intense and
I be the best in these rap events
And how I got this far?
It's called experience, come on

Yo it's the Ace in the flesh, of course I'm fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten?
Huh, you must have gotten a bad sack of weed cause I track your speed
I run up, fondle your wife and smack your seed
I've been a star since Pat Benatar
And I still want the house, the boat, the truck and the car
The limousine with the big screen and the bar
I'm trying to eat, watch it pour on like vine-gar
'Cause I'm old and grey, control the day
I'm kinda like the light cause I show the way
I'm the one to collect the funds and hold the pay
The kind that fold away than I stroll the way
Shit, I can't name all the hits we charted
That crazy ass Crooklyn ass shit, we got it
We came here tonight to get started
To cold act ill and get retarded

Marcos,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Pot-Pourri: Dupla Solidão/Silêncio

Marcos Hernandez,"If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

Everything I dream about
Everything I talk about
One thing I can't live without
I want to get closer to you
Can't stand being far away
Knowing that you don't feel the same way
Watching it bring tears to your eyes

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

All the words I sing about
All the letters I'd write about
Only thing I want to hear about
Is when I get closer to you
I know there's someone else
And he is only thinking of himself
Doesn't make any sense for you to be lonely

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

Let me the one you share your
Hopes and dreams with
You'll never be alone again
'Cause I will hold you endlessly
Please don't be afraid to let
Your broken heart guide you
Into these open arms I long
To surround you, baby

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

If you were mine I'd be your everything

Marcos Hernandez,"What I wanted for us isn't nothing 
Like the things we do to make us feel this isn't real 
And although we both know that our egos go toe to toe 
To show who really has the wheel 
We do not see how easily we come unglued 
And every word you say to me makes me confused 

You couldn't even trust me (no diggity) when I left the house 
You need to try to love me (you gotta back it up) when I'm not around 

So say what you want or say you don't want me and I'll be out 
Well I gotta bounce or say that you want me 

I am willing to bet that in time 
You would have said the same thing that I did 
And just assuming I'm alright, I must confess 
That this loneliness and me dealing with all your shit 
It goes right through me 
So do we move I know we should 
When all the bad outweighs the good 
I know we'd be better off alone 
I'm not the guy to put up with your pride 
Oh girl I gotta fly 

So say what you want or say you don't want me and I'll be out 
Well I gotta bounce or say that you want me 

Baby I've cried and prayed that I don't have no more 
More for you deep inside 
Can you just please, just tell me now 
That you ain't a part of my life 

So say what you want or say you don't want me and I'll be out 
Well I gotta bounce or say that you want me

Marcos Hernandez,"Here we are in confusion
Could be it's all an illusion
Who knows the times to come
The years to face, the race to run

We believe in the graven image
We believe in the fight to the finish
We desire the almighty dollar
The pound of flesh, the golden collar
Lick the hand, we give our land to dogs

Here we are in the years
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Have made us bondage slaves
In a world that we never made

The politicians lick your bones
The tacticians, hearts of stone
They turn us against our brothers
Make us fight and kill each other
Locked in lust we put our trust in dogs

Now here we are again
The dead still look the same
Who cares they're soon forgotten
Nobody gonna miss a corpse that's rotten

Your fathers, daughters, mothers and sons
Have been taken by the chosen ones
But don't forget you made the choice
You made your mark, you raised your voice
They're all the same, you're all to blame
They're all the same, you're all to blame
They're all the same and you're to blame, you're dogs, dogs

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Marcos Vega,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold

Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago

Marcos Witt,"Puede oscurecer puedo ser rodeado de lo que nunca esperé 
Estar en la neblina de un gran dolor, y pensar que no hay salida
Para mi 

Pero hay una verdad que nunca me dejará desfallecer 
Y aunque yo no lo deba merecer, me sostiene 

Dios ha sido fiel, Dios ha sido fiel 
Su fidelidad nunca acabará, permanecerá, siempre crecerá 

El ha sido fiel, y por siempre lo será 
El ha sido fiel y por siempre lo será 
Aunque en mi vida haya duda, en plena noche oscura 
El extiende sus brazos de amor 
Y estando en la tormenta, su mirada me alienta 
Y otra vez me deja ver que ha sido fiel - ha sido fiel 

Dios ha sido fiel, Dios ha sido fiel 
Su fidelidad nunca acabará, permanecerá, siempre crecerá

¿Cual sera el motivo de mi corazón?, ¿porque me esfuerzo?

waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow

Politic in the game, I'm just a puppet for the public
If I, spit it you can quote it
If you, read it then I wrote it
Knew it's dirty in this bitch y'all let me in it so I sold it

'cause they givin they clothes up
Sayin that they pimpin' but really givin they hoes up
Am I sick, exactly, from takin care of the family
Carry a scar on my nose, that came from my granny
A major player in this game, knew it since day one
Lookin for shit to be the same, nigga keep waitin
I done done, all I can do for the streets
Humble now I'm waitin to see what the streets do for me

Check the murder rate I ain't lyin that's a fact and

Marcus Matthews,"Zippin' up my boots 
Goin' back to my roots 
Yeah 

To the place of my birth 
Back down to earth. 

I've been standing in the rain 
Drenched and soaked with pain 

Tired of short time benefits 
And being exposed to the elements. 
I'm homeward bound 
Got my head turned around. 

Zippin' up my boots 
Goin' back to my roots 
Yeah 

To the place of my birth 
Back down to earth. 
Ain't talkin' 'bout no roots in the land 

Talkin' 'bout the roots in the man. 
I feel my spirit gettin' old 
It's time to recharge my soul 
I'm zippin' up my boots 
Goin' back to my roots 
Yeah 

To the place of my birth 
Back down to earth. 

Zippin' up my boots 
Goin' back to my roots.

Marcus Menna,"Baby, compra o jornal
E vem ver o sol
Ele continua a brilhar
Apesar de tanta barbaridade

Baby, escuta o galo cantar
A aurora dos nossos tempos
Não é hora de chorar
Amanheceu o pensamento

O poeta está vivo
Com seus moinhos de vento
A impulsionar
A grande roda da história

Mas quem tem coragem de ouvir
Amanheceu o pensamento
Que vai mudar o mundo
Com seus moinhos de vento

Se você não pode ser forte
Seja pelo menos humana
Quando o Papa e seu rebanho chegar
Não tenha pena

Todo mundo é parecido
Quando sente dor
Mas nú e só ao meio-dia
Só quem está pronto para o amor

O poeta não morreu
Foi ao inferno e voltou
Conheceu o Jardim do Édem
E nos contou

Mas quem tem coragem de ouvir
Amanheceu o pensamento
Que vai mudar o mundo
Com seus moinhos de vento",O Poeta Está Vivo
Marcus Menna,"Eu vejo a vida melhor no futuro
Eu vejo isso por cima de um muro
De hipocrisia que insiste em nos rodear

Eu vejo a vida mais clara e farta
Repleta de toda satisfação
Que se tem direito do firmamento ao chão

Eu quero crer no amor numa boa
Que isso valha pra qualquer pessoa
Que realizar a força que tem uma paixão

Eu vejo um novo começo de era
De gente fina, elegante e sincera
Com habilidade
Pra dizer mais sim do que não, não, não

Hoje o tempo voa, amor
Escorre pelas mãos
Mesmo sem se sentir
Não há tempo que volte, amor
Vamos viver tudo que há pra viver
Vamos nos permitir

Marcus Miller,"If you feel the same for me, the way I feel for you
I'll rush over

Your music is so very beautiful
I want to feel you creep inside me
The warmth of a kiss beneath my berry skin
I want to experience the taste of dark berry nectar
The seed of life
Heaven everlasting, the phone just won't suffice for more
My imagination is filled and my cup runneth over

If you feel the same for me the way I feel for you
I'll rush over
There's no need to be alone
My warmth for you is rushing over

Patiently I wait for an invitation
I often try to imagine, picture you
For you're no more than a voice on my telephone 
That I find myself rushing home to 
Your voice makes me want to do things I'm much too shy to say
You leave me to question

If you feel the same for me the way I feel for you
I'll rush over
There's no reason to be alone
My warmth for you is rushing over",Rush Over
Marcus Miller,"Close my eyes
I try to hide
I'm listening to my voice inside
What's on to tell me right or wrong
I need to know where I belong
For all the days I ran away
I never dare to ask me who could I be
Who can bring back the love that's inside me

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could It be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you

Too many things said and done
Sure if you could be the one
To dry the tears I left behind
To chase these demons off my mind

I see your face
Touch your skin
Is this a fight
We both can't win
Sometimes the truth is miles apart
But it's hard to break your heart

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could It be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you

Baby i don't wanna waste your love
Though it's hard to just walk on
Well will this hurt be neverending
Where do I belong

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
Just to leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true i don't have a clue
Could it be you

Maybe it is me
Used to plan to see that it's you
For everything I am everything I need lies in you",Could It Be You
Marcus Miller,"Your'e a taker, baby. Takin but never givin
You better be careful, lady, ooh bout how youre livin
See love dont like when u break hearts like that
And, just like a boomerang, its gonna come right back, oh

Now when u get thru stompin on my heart like that
Keep your eyes open baby, ooh you better watch you back
Cause love will turn around and do the same damn thing to you
Just like a boomerang, its gonna come back to you, oh

Whoa you see I love you baby
You got me hangin on a string
Tear out my heart and throw it down, stomp my feelings on the ground
I'll be all right, cant keep me down, what goes around comes around!
When you live like that, when you take but never give, baby
Its gonna come right baby
When you live like that, when you hurt me like you do
Just like a boomerang, its gonna come back to you",Boomerang
