The Band Perry,"I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Well,
It won't be whiskey, won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Dig two
Ooh, ooh

I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now,
Oh, right now

If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rights

And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!

Heavy stone right next to mine,
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do,
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead",Better Dig Two
The Band Perry,"I wanna wake where I was born and breathe the old air in
I need a haunt from a ghost that I knew way back then
Oh I hope they left the light on
I want someone who knows me just to say my name
To tell me though things are different now somehow I'm still the same
Oh I can almost hear them calling

I don't know if I'll be back again
It turns out they were right again
(Get back to what you know)(Get back to what you do)
I gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true home is where the heart is
I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know)(Get back to what you do)
I gotta get back to me without you

For two years I've lived my life way out on a limb
I put my faith in you not knowing you would break in the end
Oh I hate feeling fallen

I don't know if I'll be back again
It turns out they were right again
(Get back to what you know) (Get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true home is where the heart is
I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know)(Get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me without you

I added rain to your ocean
What did it do, it meant nothing to you
You made grief my chief emotion
Why'd you have to do what you thought you had to do

Get back to what know

I don't know if I'll be back again
Turns out they were right again
(Get back to what you know)(Get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true home is where the heart is
Oh I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know)(Get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me without you

The slow death of a slow dance
The tailspin of a romance
Gotta get back and breathe the old air in",Back to Me Without You
The Band Perry,"We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
Well I came out here to see it one more time

And I got my chainsaw
Oh you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw

I guess all those years
They don't mean a thing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
'Cause I don't have you

But I got my chainsaw
Oh you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw

Just a lil' old chainsaw

I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote forever with a pocketknife
But forever's goin' down tonight

'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's got to go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw

Chain chain chain-saw

(Chain chain-saw)",Chainsaw
The Band Perry,"You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far to long 'cause I never gave up the fight, until now

It's gonna hit you hard til you see stars
It's gonna put through you a world of hurt
Oh I don't believe in getting even but giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be your just for fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done, done

You crossed the line too many times,
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite don't be surprised when I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be part of your fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done

(Done) with your selfish ways
And all the games you play
I'm through with you and everything you say

Mama told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave that advice

Mama always told me that I should play nice
But she didn't know you when she gave that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Scatter the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da (la ti da)
I don't wanna be your just for fun,
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
All I wanna be is done

Hey ooh, I wanna be done (so done)
So done (so done) so done",DONE.
The Band Perry,"Here I am standing firm
As the ground shakes beneath me
I send you away with my own hand
I try and try to remember that for now it's for the better
But there's a Southern kind of tragic blowing in
Oh and it feels like the beginning of the end

Well the Alabama moon fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time

I'm scared to death, pick up your phone, outside
I hear the bells ringing
Bringing ruin to all that we have ever known
Pick up your phone, I need an answer
Come home and call off disaster
'Cause I fear tonight our Cotton Land might fall
Oh I'm cracking like the plaster on the wall

Oh the Alabama moon fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time

It's the end of time
Is it the end of all time
Or just the end of mine

Well all of the cotton it died in the fields
The little babies cried the blue from their eyes
Somewhere I'll bet you're living it up
So come home before the end

The Alabama moon, fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time

Come home come home and be mine
Come home and come home",End of Time
The Band Perry,"The airline lost my luggage and the governor lost my vote
My best friend lost her innocence in her boyfriend's rowboat
Your mother lost her favorite pearls, the ones that you gave to me
Oh, I lost them when I tossed them on the day that you lost me

Forever mine, forever mine oh my
You saved my life, you said forever (Forever!)
Never (Never!)

I broke my bedroom mirror and it broke my luck in two
Then my brothers broke the bad bad news, that you broke the truth
So I smashed my right hand open, when I smashed the nose on you
'Cause you smashed my heart when you did what you said you'd never do

Forever mine, forever mine oh my
You saved my life when, you said forever (Forever!)
Never (Never!)

Mine, nevermind
You must have lost your mind
When you said forever, you could do better (Never!)

Oh I'll forget the day, I saw your face
I lost my way, I trusted you, I trusted all your lovely words
They were a curse, you piece of dirt,
Ooh I trusted you, I trusted you, I trusted you

Forever
Forever mine, forever mine oh my
You saved my life,
You said forever (Forever!)
Never (Never!)
Mine, nevermind
Did you lose your mind?
'Cause you said forever, you could do better
Never!

Forever is a long long time
No
Forever mine

The South lost the battle and children lose their youth
The best day of my life was on the day that I lost you",Forever Mine Nevermind
The Band Perry,"Well I never felt nothing like I did tonight
You had the face of a boy that I met in a dream one time
Some heard it thunder and so did I
I swear it happened when your eyes met mine

Maybe it was just the way the wind blew
Maybe it was God and his son too
But in that moment I know that I knew that I,
I found you

I saw a light I,
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here, mine all mine well
I saw a light I, saw a light

Well I still can't believe someone left you laying around
Something precious like you should have already been found

What if I'd stayed home and done nothing tonight
What if you had looked left and I had looked right
For once in our lives we were both on time and now
I found you

I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here,
Mine all mine well
I saw a light I
Saw

Somebody told me
When I was younger
Chance is like lightning
Love is like thunder
So I walked right over
Asked for your number
'Cause somebody told me when I was younger

I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling, that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here before my eyes
The thunder in my heart it tells me, you are mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
A light",I Saw a Light
The Band Perry,"Blue eyed Susans, standing in a domino line
Falling in and out of love all the time
They'll break your heart just to see a boy cry
ah but not me
I am a brown eyed loner, I march to my own drummer
I'm a piccolo owner and the labor of my mother's love
Honey you'd be a load off her mind

But with or without you
My only plan is to be free
With or without you
I'm still me
Ah

I'll join a band and sing like a canary
Get out of here and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper
Oh, I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper

Long stem roses, standing in a vase by my bed
Standing tall like the dreams in my head
I'm not gonna live in this house 'til I'm dead
I like you a lot 'cause you're different a little
You got answers to my riddles
Your daddy is a pistol and you are a son of a gun
I could be the daughter that he never wanted

But with or without you I'll buy a farm at the edge of the prairie
Live off the land and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper ah, I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper

With or without you, my only plan is to be free
With or without you
Bye babe

I'll buy a sword and join the military
Cut my hair and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper ah, I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper, oh, I am a keeper baby

I'm not one of those blue eyed Susans
Ha ah, I'm doing my own thing

I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby",I'm a Keeper
The Band Perry,"She's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of the house
A blind believer in all I dare to be
There's no safer place I've found
Than the shoulder of her white night gown
Oh I've got the best and the worst of her in me
And I'd share her if I could

So the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And our cares would all be freer
If the world had a mother like mine

She's our father's one great love
She's the one he wanted most
She's the light in the window of the house I grew up in
She takes the midnight call
She's the bravest of us all
Still she sings in the garden, she let's her hair down in

Oh the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder, if somebody wanted them
Tonight would be easier
And our dreams would all be deeper
If the world had a mother like mine

Don't go away, don't go away from me
Oh I understand, she is a helping hand still
I have to say

She's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of our house
We all need her, but no one more than me

Oh the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder, if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And the dishes would all be cleaner
If the world had a mother like mine

Oh like mine",Mother Like Mine
The Band Perry,"Well you can find my face where the moon light lingers 'cause it's
Friday night and it's as hot as ever
Oh my heart is banging to the beat
Of the band
Me and my pals we got scars from the week
But now we're making our noise and we're moving our feet
As we do our best to let things get out of hand

Oh it's a night gone wasted again
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go around
Oh it's a night gone wasted, oh yeah

Well all of our eyes they got rings of fire 'cause we're
Burning time like, there's no tomorrow
Oh it's gonna take a while to blow off, a week's worth of steam
So tell your, your sweet mama not to worry her pretty little head
'Cause I'll have you home soon and then I'll tuck you in bed
But until then let's do our best to get out of hand

Man oh man

It's a night gone wasted again
Oh, I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to help the whole wide world go around
Oh it's a night gone wasted
Oh yeah

Oh what a riot it's been
I'm gonna save up some more money to spend
Another night

Well well well
It's the best medication to help the whole population survive
It's a night gone wasted
Oh it's a night gone wasted
Oh it's a night night gone wasted

The Band Perry,"Oh Pioneer, I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer, your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart

Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer, you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild

Where are we going, oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life, they will replace me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
I won't hush, no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere

The Band Perry,"Hey yesterday is the day you died, could it be you just stopped feeling alive?
Trouble's on your shoulders for so long, you'll be stronger when the moment's gone
You're looking for a better day, the darkest hour finds the brightest grace
So today, I know you'll come to realize
Come to realize that

Hey, everything is gonna be okay, may God kiss your weary face
Everything is gonna alright, let peace be yours tonight
Rest and know you're saved, don't be afraid, oh
Everything is gonna be okay
Be okay

I see the storm clouds in your eyes, don't be afraid to taste the tears you cry
Ring the good out of the bad, there's an awful lot of beauty in that
You're looking for a hand to hold, you gotta stumble to stand up on your own, oh
My fingertips within your grip
Reach a little further and 

Hey, everything is gonna be okay, may God kiss your weary face
Everything is gonna alright, let peace be yours tonight
Rest and know you're saved, don't be afraid, oh

You'll see a brighter day, yeah",Gonna Be OK
The Band Perry,"Maybe I could stick my feet in a wishing well
Pocket full of pennies maybe I could get some help
I got a hole in my heart like the holes in my jeans
I try to patch it up with anything and everything

But it ain't workin'
So why do we believe 
In every little thing 
That rips us at the seams

Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones

Maybe I could bet my love on a four leaf clover
The winter house, then you know it's over
It's cold in my soul like it's cold outside
Cross my heart and hope to find the love that lasts a lifetime

But I ain't there yet
So why do we keep 
Giving hearts away
To things that only break

Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones baby
Cuz there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Woah-oh

Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice, no
Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice

The Band Perry,"This Georgia highway is crowded with break lights
And I'm here tonight
But I'm driving fast
In my mind
Cherry cheeks despite this sour life I'm alright
And everyone wonders why

Oh

Would you repaint the picture?
You make everything in this sun kissed instead of bitter

Sweet, when I walk with you, and your hand's holding mine
You're so sweet
The troubles of the day fade away
To peaches and Caroline

I just can't help the way you make me smile
In a world of frowns, yeah
When all hope is crumbling down
You are my safe and sound
You are my feet upon the ground
And my wings up in the sky
Oh baby, you make me fly

Would you repaint the picture?
You make everything in this sun-kissed instead of bitter

Sweet, when I walk with you, and your hand's holding mine
You're so sweet
The troubles of the day fade away
To peaches and Caroline

Well I'm still here waiting
And I'm singing a sweet song on the radio
And tough times never felt so good
Just like a diamond in my soul

And you're so sweet

Hot and cold water to run anytime

A bum could rummage through ya bin
And live like a king
On just one crumb o'ya cake
N'ya say ya life needs fulfilling
Some would give anything to live like you
Shame your mind, don't shine
Like your possessions do
Whining, complaining all the time
Don't see no rain on you
What side your bread is buttered on
If only you knew

What d'ya mean

Yep

I was told as a child
I wants never gets
Learned to count my blessings
Long before I saw an abacus
So what ya family don't speak
At least they're alive
Show me a man without guilt
Or a soul that ain't lied
You don't know what ya got
Open your eyes, look around
Really, hear me you
Ain't got no reason to be down

What d'ya mean
I want more

Friend what is it that you seek
What is it that you try to find
Someday I hope you realized
It shined in you all the time
Hills to climb, sights to see, seas to cross
Friends to make, hands to shake, the world is yours
Foods to taste, sounds to hear, love to feel
Seeds to sow, things to know, fish to reel
Space to quiz, stones to lift, life's a gift

Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

The Banner,"I check my hand, it's shredded and bleeding
From holding broken glass punching echoes in the face
Can't see you, eyes covered, not looking your ice blue eyes pierce like
Lightning through the space
Thirteen arrows tear tunnels right through me
My fingers stuff the holes but the bleeding it persists
Check my mirror its cracking distorted
My vision could be questioned but the visage no doubt mine
And now I'm teasing with these rattlesnakes
I'm kissing cobras on the head
I roll the dice despite my past mistakes
Only the lucky end up dead
I'll face the pain but the pain ain't mine
I shouldn't walk this late at night
Asking for trouble when I climbed that fence
I'm out of my mind she's out of sight
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so put my calls on hold
Now joey no fights tonight, I'd bet shed wish I was
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so tell em' I'm not home
Now joey no trouble tonight, how does she always know.",Rattlesnakes
The Banner,"Kill yourself all by yourself
Your eyes cried dry and you've gained nothing
Hearts in shreds your own knife
Refuse to escape your self made torture
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into...
And I'm sorry, if my momentary lapse just caused you one more thing
And knowing what I've done can tug a fraying tear
Like thread slipping through my fingers and that's not much to show for pain
Endured
But in the end you'll learn its worth
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into hell
Longing, desire, burning inside her
Crawling in darkness, only a glimmer of hope as she yelled these words.
I'll face my pain
On my own - standing strong
Prove for myself.

The Bar-Kays,"Just for that moment time stood still. 
Nothing mattered but the thrill of things to come and never knowin' where your goin'. 
A little nervous and out of practice, 
Sweaty palms and an awkward silience. 
You pulled me closer for a kiss and 
I'm so scared to feel like this. 
Can't stop my hands from shakin'.

I won't blink 'cause I might miss and 
I've waited way too long for this. 
The perfect words at the perfect time. 
The perfect song with the perfect rhyme 
Compose the soundtrack to our night. 
Are you listening?

Tonight the world will wait for us 
To say it's ok to move again. 
The stars will have to find another sky to 
Shed some light 'cause this is our time to shine.

Is there some place we could go to be alone? 
One last thing before you go. 
A little song to let you know that 
I never wanted to be anything but 
Everything to you my dear. 
But I spoke too soft for you to hear me say, 
""I wish that I could stay.""

And though it's our last night, 
Let's make it a lifetime before the sun comes up again. 
I know this is goodbye. 
I promise I won't cry if you promise you won't forget.",Shine
The Bar-Kays,"I can't hardly wait

Tonight the need for love, is here between us
And the desire for each other, we cannot hide
Cause anxiously we wait, to feel the passion
That the hunger in our eyes, can't disguise

So girl let's not waste, another moment
Trying to decide, right or wrong
Just come and hold me close, to your body
And let's release the love we've been holding back so long

I'm trying so hard to be patient, 
But when you're near me I loose control
And there is no time for hesitation, 
And if you don't give your love to me, 
I'm going to explode from

Anticipation, anticipating your every move
Anticipation, anticipating what we're going to do
Don't make me wait, yeah

So girl let's put an end, to all this waiting
And let the power of our desires, tonight unfold
No matter how hard, we try to fight it
When the needle rises baby, it's time to let go

I'm trying so hard to be patient, 
But when you're near me I loose control
And there is no time for hesitation, 
And if you don't give your love to me,

Oh, no, I started to cry. Which started the whole world laughing.

And surely something's got to come to you

Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Then my woe's got to go
And my love, she will know
From morning, noon and night

And she's got to say it's alright
Say it's all right

We'll leave the rain behind and walk away.

We walk along the lonesome shoreline listening to the sea, 
Talking to you and me about the sky
And we know even as we walk that way before the dawn
Our footsteps will be gone far away.

Can't you hear them sigh out your name?

They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.

The Barry Sea Paradox,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed days, and dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
 
The colors of the rainbow
Are so pretty in the sky
It's also on the faces
Of people goin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', ""How do you do?""
They're really sayin' I, ""I love you.""

The Barry Sisters,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
The Barry Sisters,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless
The Baseballs,"I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
Because I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
When I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead.

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When it comes to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

She brings flesh to my bones

I'm loving angels instead

The Baseballs,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, you cut me open

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, you cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, you cut me open

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But just believe me girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we know we would, my word is good

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
The turn around and leave again

Repair your broken wings

Tony sailed across the bar

Brighter than all their streets of gold

And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride ride ride the wild surf

Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone
Ride ride ride the wild surf

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance

When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend

I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too
And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had

The Beach Boys,"There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round

I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now

I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

I'm a little bit scared
Cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love
And I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them
Told 'em what I was up to said that's not me

I went through all kinds of changes
Took a look at myself and said that's not me
I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone I will dream

I once had a dream
So I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready

She said ""I crave adventure don't you know""

And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leavin' no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that

Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are livin' in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack

It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way
If we all get together we can make things right
And we can bring back summer

Get us back our summer

Like evryone from california to kokomo

And raisin' world consciousness
We gotta fix this mess

Looked in the future and what I saw
Was a world in harmony with natural law
There's trouble now but it will be alright if we can

Bring back summer
Get us back our summer

The Beach Boys,"I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their saftey zones

And what can you say that won't make them defensive

Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like their peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened

Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders

Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
Thy love they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs

The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong

The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented Tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?

I'll remember all winter long

Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before i melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""catch me if you can""

He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""",Frosty the Snowman [Vocal Take 4]

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.

""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

And people of the world are all rejoicing
For the baby Jesus born in Nazarene

The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring
And little Children everywhere are caroling
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing

Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling

In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

I wish that every kiss was never ending

Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do

The Beach Boys,"I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash , they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash
They did the mash , they did the monster mash

If you've ever seen a monster before
Dancin' across the dance floor
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout
Turn around and help the monster turn it out

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
And if you don't have core hard cash
You can still do the monster mash

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

The monster mash

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash

The Beach Boys,"Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose

But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

Ain't it always just a short vacation
When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustation
While the body goes in search again

But in the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
You better get out and move on in

'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

Why do you love someone
Who wants to break your heart
Why do you need someone
Who wants to tear your world apart

No no not again

I was packing up my life in cases
For a hundred years or maybe more
I've been talking to a million people
Don't you think I should have known the score

But in the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
You better get out and move on in

'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

Nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

The Beach Boys,"School days
School days
Dear old Golden Rule days

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American History and Practical Math
Studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
And workin' your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks

Ha ha ha ha ha
Are you ready?

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
And all day long you've been wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go

Hail hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums loud and bold
Rock rock rock and roll
The feelin' is there, body and soul

She can make my whole world bright

She brings out the sun at night

Sailing on the sea

In a boat

Just-a her and me

And propose

That she'll be my only one


She can make you feel so fine

Like to love her all the time

It's the reason I'm a-pleasin' my sunshine


Some-a-day I'm

Gonna marry her

Some-a-way I'm

Gonna carry her

To a place where we can play in the sun


Like a full moon shinin' bright

She'll light up the darkest night

Will she squeeze me

How she'll please me

Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well
Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle

In the open air the painters show their art
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day

Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees

Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse

But there's something special 'bout this quiet dawn
It seems to sing a song to everyone
It's dawning on and on and on

My Grandfather and me.
Round Nassau-town we did roam.

We got in a fight
I feel so break up,
I want to go home.

So, hoist up the John B. sails,
See how the mains?l?s set;
Send for the cap?n ashore, lemme go home!
Lemme go home! Lemme go home!

Break up the peoples trunk,
Constable come aboard and take him away,
Mr. Johnstone, please let me alone,
I feel so break-up, I want to go home.

Throw away all the grits,
Then he took and eat up all o? my corn,
Lemme go home, I want to go home!

The Beach Boys,"Sweet sweet honey bee
Eat up, eat up, eat up, honey

Mama I'm tellin' you as sure as I'm standing here
She's my girl and that's the way I'm keeping it now mama dear
No good will it do you to stand there and frown at me
The girl's got my heart and my love's coming down on me
My love's coming down since I got a taste of wild honey
You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
Wild honey
She got it on and stung me good yes sirree

With all the other stud bees buzzing all around her hive
She singled me out, single handed took me alive
Well can you can, you gonna take my life eating up her wild honey

(Sweet, sweet,honey bee)
(Eat up, eat up, eat up, honey)

Oh mama she's sweeter
Gettin' sweeter
Sweeter, sweeter

Let me tell you how she really got to my soul
It ain't funny
The way she make want to sing a little rock 'n' roll
There's nothing quite nice as a kiss of wild honey
I break my back workin' just to save me some money
So I can spend my life with her
Sock it to me wild honey

The Beach Boys,"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true (Run run ooo)
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (We could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Wouldn't it be nice

It only makes it worse to live without it

You paddle out turn around and raise

You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon
And watch 'em they'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world

Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Every Saturday boy
But don't treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world

You know they suddenly rise 
They started slow long ago

And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of

She knows me
I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forget just by making her laugh
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys

I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains

Once at night the cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head=to-toe, healthy, weathy and wise

To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right

Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne

The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people

And was buried along with her name

From his hands as he walks from the grave

And if you say the word,
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse

Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save

So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be

He creeps up from behind.

Say he must go free

Any way you'll never know

But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl 
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm telling you

You know you pick me up 
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile 
Replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer 
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say 
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather 
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue

The Beatles,"Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say ""Hello"".

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!

On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy

And offers comin' over the phone

And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote them like that

If you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
The just play it like that

And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
What words I pair
Or if my hair is brown
'Cause it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dull and out of key
You're correct
'Cause there's nobody there

And it's only there's no one there",Only a Northern Song

Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

""Oh shit""

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you

The Beatles,"I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive.
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive.
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door.
I don't hear it,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a'ticking,
On the mantel shelf.
See the hands a'moving,
But I'm by myself.
I wonder where you are tonight,
And why I'm by myself.
I don't see you,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.

I'm sorry that I doubted you,
I was so unfair.
You were in a car crash,
And you lost your hair.
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two.
I said, ""That's alright, I'm waiting here,
Just waiting to hear from you"".

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
