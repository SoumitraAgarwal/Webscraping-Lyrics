Gary Numan,"Final bow
In a disused music hall
Of laughter and mime
The airwave police
Were the only
Admirers to admire

Sliding sideways in a rusty old Ford
The drivers broke down and
A young girl screams
Walking through rock dreams
Tall stories
Mobile T.V. radio
Nobody came

The station is abandoned
Deserted for peace day
Some old man said 'Just do your best'
And I think passed away

My shadow is never far behind
And I must find another role to play
Visit maskmaker
Please bend my mind
Someone, no one
I really don't mind
Nobody cares
",Monday Troop
Gary Numan,"Hollow
Faces staring through my window
Sometimes
I can play a boy you might know
Station
Standing cold and old I'm insane
Gender
Is uncertain just like my name

The lemon kid is my friend
But even he don't know me well
Oh that's too bad
The waiter is an old man
Who looks at me so sly and strange
What's on his mind

Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you

Queenie
From a doorway says ""You got time?""
Panic
Not tonight if you don't mind
Oh no
My fear of streets I cover
Today
My room is home for hours

You can stay if you know your lines
But please take care
I'll suck your mind dry
You'll never guess
And you can never know me
I'll change if I begin to feel
What's your name

Zero hero says I'm no-one
He could be right but who's to know
Man from the sky
Oh well I'm growing tired of this place
I think it's time to change my face
You can't even try

Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you 

",Oh! Didn't I Say
Gary Numan,"I don't wanna hear you talk 
And I don't wanna go for walks 
But I just wanna lay you flat 
Well you think you're so good at that 

I've got no time for your sad eyes 
I don't care if you say good-bye 
I don't really think that I want 
Anything to do with your 

Out of sight 
Out of mind 

The radio continues 'round me 
Blending faces glaring at me 

 
  
 
How was I to telephone 
Crawl away to end it all 

Spiral staircase leads to nowhere 
I an take you somewhere (who cares) 
Dee-Dee's crazy as a model 
I'd break your heart if I'd got time 

Out of sight 
Out of mind

You're breaking down my message wall

Out of mind

",Out of Sight
Gary Numan,"Slowly the thought
""There is no one to replace""
Came into view
And he began to cry
Now only boys
That love only boys
The perfect picture
Of a boy/girl age

I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens

Grey overcoat
And he could be anyone
A random poll check
""Do you ever think of women?""
They broke him down
Into a torn old queen
Living somewhere
Between dead and dying

I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens

There are no more
Do you begin to see?
The corner of my eye
Could give me away
Isn't it strange
How times change?
I can't imagine
Living any other way

Gary Numan,"It was hard to avoid
I suppose it was the shame
But they didn't even try
You see we'd never met
And they didn't have names
There was nothing I could do

So I turned on the crowd
And I screamed 'you and you'
'It could have been you'
And they seemed to think
That I looked that way
Or maybe I was wrong

So I said
Do you know Mr. wall 
And they looked the other way
And then they smiled at me

But the police came
And I said it was me
And I just walked away",Replicas
Gary Numan,"Memories lost in faded films of my life
And a friend that used to be something special to me
Red wine and good times if you don't feel at all
There is no point in going on tonight

Something's in the house something's on the stairs
War's in the air
The queer is out of order and me i'm on the ground
But that's no place to be

""Oh me, I'm going home""
""Oh what a shame""

Gary Numan,"I look up and the camera eye is
Searching my room
The TV screen is calling me
But for what or whom
Please mister do be careful
I'm so fragile
Maybe they'll let me down
To Speedy's place for a while

Oh well that's too bad
Oh well that's too bad
Oh well that's too bad
Oh well that's too bad

I talk a lot, a sign of fear
I thought you should know
I can see pictures of me well
They're so-so
I'll come on to the leader
Like I'm some hero
He'll laugh and raise his dying eyes
And just tell me to go

1920 Flashbacks for an hour or more
Of crazy actors hiding
In the doorways top floor
Machines scream in anger
From a thousand dead ends
I turn my face, I crawl away,
I look for a friend


",That's Too Bad [Single Version]
Gary Numan,"I'm not so sure 
I still want more of this 
My mind's not quite 
Behaving, I don't know 
I'm not feeling like I'm told I should (???) 

 
  
 

This is my life 
Welcome to me tonight 
I don't feel too 
Glad to be here for sure 
I'm not feeling anymore at all 

This is my head 
This is my face 
It's all my fault 
This is my place 
I don't really think I wanna stay
",This Is My Life
Gary Numan,"Sometimes I feel
I live like a prisoner
But I don't know
If this really is pressure
Surprise you win
I'm lost as screamers roll in
Sometimes I feel
Like leaving this room I'm in

Faded film people dropping words
About the real things to say
? (Not ""Someone pulls me deeper"", as in CD booklet)
And tells me who I will be if I stay
A clever machine writes pretty words
For pretty boys
To sing to us all
We're all so grateful

My face you cry
And I show my darker side
The night is yours
And I just switch off and hide
Cafe and sin
The wine's not to my liking
My face you cry
Oh my didn't I say come in?

Frown (?) in my eyes showing nothing
But surprise about you
And what are you thinking
About my life and her drinking to you too
A dying non-human writes unkind words
For unkind friends
And as for the tears, they'll never show
Asylum people calling on my door
From day to day
The image must fall
I've had my time

",Thoughts No. 2
Gary Numan,"Listen good
Don't cry for me
Don't cry anymore

Now just shut your mouth
This point of view
Appeals to me

Listen babe
Say you've got no-one tonight

Same old smile
That cracked a thousand hearts
But not mine

Same old line
I've read the book
And I know you well

Listen babe
Say you've got no-one tonight

What's this feeling
That I don't believe
No concern on my face

What's it for
You dream of something
Like I dreamed of you

Listen babe
Say you've got no-one tonight",The 1930's Rust
Gary Numan,"You and me are old
You and me are young
You and me have always
Let words go unsung


Nothing left to see
Nothing left to do
Nothing left to talk about


How I intrude
This impossible room
I still believe
That great American smile


Nothing's ever right
Nothing's ever wrong
But nothing's ever quite like
The stories and songs (nothing's ever)


Heroes always bleed
But heroes never cry
Heroes always get the best girl
And then die (nothing's ever)


How I intrude
This impossible dream
I still believe
That great American smile


",A Dream of Siam
Gary Numan,"We are assassins
We are not evil
We act with reason and heart

We are not vicious
Is that surprising? 
We're so much larger than life

I, assassin, I am
I, assassin, I am

I just arrived
Something to fix
This new depression

We are not hunters
We are just patient
We'll wait a lifetime for you
Just you

I've never felt good
I've never felt bad
I've never felt much at all

Gary Numan,"You can cry by my window
You can crawl on the floor
You can scream if you want to
But I won't unlock the door

You can sleep in bus shelters
You can sleep in the park
But I'll rip up the trees
Until you tear yourself apart

But I don't love you
No I don't love you
Do you dream? 

Back to surveillance
Open eyes and wash out 'tear'
A sign that says 'no exit'
And 'no-one can save you here'

I could talk about my programme
Where everything is white
I could specialize in pictures
Where nothing's ever right

But I don't love you
No I don't love you
Do you dream? 

We are just sound
We are just noise
And we are all here to lie

Gary Numan,"Where is my outline I start to fade
No concentration means 'fail' these days

I leave the table saying 'i am real'
I feel the pressure like your eyes on me
Don't mention that name and books on love
I can't be sure, I can't be sure

You end on reel one
You end on reel one

You quote from 'anxious' and things we do
I need protection from the likes of you

Do you begin to see that I don't know
I live on memories that are hard to find
Send me a card and write 'i think of you'
I'll say you lied, I'll say you're lying

You are, you are

Tell me a secret I'm sure to fall
My dog runs a.w.o.l. I blame you all

We're in formation saying 'safe, safe, safe'
Turn up my collar and mix with dark
The speaker turns on me spot her eyes

About conversation and you

Will disappear with time

Gary Numan,"Here we are
We drift like gas
On someone else's bed
I pay high you know


Here we are
How old are you
It's just a job to me


Here the ladies always ring twice
Thought you'd slip away tonight with me
In a subway I called 'you'


Hello you no more this talk of
'My boys will be yours'


No more 'I'
This conversation drains
My patience dry.


Here the business always rings twice
No relaxing for the boys tonight
In a subway I called 'you'


Here the tension always slows twice
Shed one tear it's just routine for now
In a subway I called 'you'


",A Subway Called 'You'
Gary Numan,"I've read the papers
Look at this
They say that I'm all over
I don't know
They're not the first ones to try
So try
Again

What's the fashion?
Is it good?
I'll need some convincing
If you've got it
Then I've seen it before
So try
Again

Welcome to new anger
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

I don't need it
I can stop
I can take this or leave it
You can have it
But if you want it from me
Then come
And try

I've been bad
I've been good
I've been one more hero
I've been up
And I've been lower than you
So come
And try

If you want it
Come and get it

So keep it out the papers

I need it
The sex musicians
I'll show you something
While the boys beat time

I need it
And she's still waiting
We like to wake up
In a strange bed romance

One more time for me
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies
Please one more time for me
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies

Cold and sane

Cold metal rhythm
Takes me back to god

Know my reason
Know my name

Thank you for nothing
I like this anger
And I won't forget

This isn't love
Its more like a need

And I need the cure

Saw her again in a magazine
Front cover, big star
Showing things that I'd never seen
Well maybe

Can you feel it? Can you?

I remember one girl
Who'd believe she'd be so devious
Bad decision, bad move
She told the papers everything
Well maybe

Do you need it, do you?
Do you want it, do you?
Come and get it

I remember one girl
She'd only make friends in expensive cars
Television, good wine
Leather seats and a friend of mine
Well maybe

Something's coming

",This Is Emotion
Gary Numan,"Something here
Something is cold and you know
To speak now is to lie
Sad mistake
Maybe it's mine but I know
You wake up with strangers
Is this love
If I said goodbye there would be
No-one to listen
I could ask
""How do you feel?"" but I know
You breathe in emotion

So goodbye
I can't play anymore
So goodbye
I'm off the friendship line
So goodbye
I'm breathing emotion like some hero
Breathe in emotion

I could cry
""Nothing is wrong"" but you know
I don't believe it
I could write
Words on a page but I know
Love doesn't live here
Look at me
Look at my eyes and you'll know
Everything's over
This is me
This is my heart and you know
I breathe in emotion

So goodbye
I can't play anymore
So goodbye
I'm off the friendship line
So goodbye
I'm breathing emotion like some hero

Got to pull it out
Got to survive
Got to stay calm
Got to think fast

Searching for a door
Searching for a way
Out of this thing
I don't know what's wrong
Don't know what to do
I'm out of control
Nothing I can do
Nothing seems to work
I'm barely alive
Got to slow it down
Got to do something
Or give in
Watching us fall
Trying everything
Fighting for life
Running out of time
I don't have a choice
I'm riding it in

I'm inside and I'm trying to get out
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help
And everything's gone wrong
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears
I'm listening to me

This is the fear
This is nothing like
You could believe
Panic in my heart
Like a cold hand
Pulling at strings
I'll do anything
Even pray to God
Just let me out
Turn off the machine
Turn off all the noise
Turn off the world

'Bout a friend of mine
Woke up in this room
Looked like... black and white movies

No light
And someone strange in the bed
She said
""You could be here forever""

""Can you feel me?
I'm the new disease
I'm like a hunger
That you've never known""

""Do you want me?
I'll take everything
I'm like a hunger
Lying in your heart""

He made excuses
Tried to leave the room
She said
""I'm the disease and the cure

Skin mechanics
Couldn't help you here
The nature of need
Leaves you junk sick and lonely""

""Trick it up
Trick it up good""

Like a ghost to the door
She said
""This is a re-al love story""

And walked in on it all

""You could be here forever""

She will change your mind.
She will change your rules.
She will make you blind.

You will never try to look into her heart.

See there's no-one home.

See an empty room.

Time helps you forget
See no tears for you.

Like she laughed at me?
Does she break your heart

Remember we toured the skys
And if the 'friends' all go home
You know love needs no disguise

He dances
And we realised
Remember
Love needs no disguise

They lie
In darkness

No fear
No talking
Just this long wait for pain


Scream scream
We're going down
My centurion dies


All I can do now is wait for the noise


I'm so helpless and
I could just cry inside
'No! No!'


Oh God
Look at the speed
We're going in


So this
Is death and
It's so
Calm I'm surprised


All I can do now is wait for noise


This machine
No sign of life
Only the whisper of air


She won't turn
She won't climb
She won't stop
She won't fly

I'm silent
I'm thinking
I'm waiting for this thing to end.


All I can do now is wait for the noise.

No doors, no windows, no fireplace

I can't speak to you at all

My God how time flies
I close up my brain
And another friend dies

I feel like a mirror
Feel like nothing is mine
I could go back to crying
But now dying seems fine

So I hang from the ceiling
Or I sit on the air
Or rot in a corner
Until somebody cares

Faces at random
I quote people I knew
I'd love to be like me
If I can feel like you

Here am I more roche five than pain
Here am I just me and my walls to blame
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane

Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain
Lock my door I only think in black and white
I'll even try to look ashamed

Moving out of central
Somebody knows me well
Says he'll spill the whole story
He may be lying I can't tell

Meet me inside
I'll keep my head to the floor
And one hand on the handle
Of the mad sane door

Here am I more roche five than pain
Here am I just me and my walls to blame
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane

Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain
Lock my door I only think in black and white
I'll even try to look ashamed

My shadow in vain

You lied to mother
You lied to brother and me

I forget how to
So should I learn how to lie?

You take my ghosts and laugh
You take my reason
You take my soul away.
You take my heartbeat
You take my innocence
You take my dreams and

",Your Fascination
Gary Numan,"So I close my eyes and drift into sleep
But something is here
In the dark, in the dream
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart
I feel more than I see
Like a clue to a nightmare that I can't believe
Then it touches me and I try to scream
And a thought tears me inside
And I will do anything
Anything, you understand?
Just to wake up 

Sometimes it almost makes me cry
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone
And then it comes for me again 

I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God
I can't believe that God would do this to me 

I've known fear many times but nothing like this
I'm so scared I can't breathe
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real
And nothing can help me here
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back
And then it was gone
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in
And I will never sleep alone again 

Sometimes it almost breaks my heart
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me
Sometimes it feels like I could die
And then it leaves my dreams again 

Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'

If you come for me.

I'll give you black rumours
'Stay away from everything I've seen.'
I'll give you black rumours
'Stay away from everyone I've been.'


The broken sound of love and lies
Still fill your room.
Faded memories of shame
Will find you soon.


I'll give you corrosion
Miracles are never what they seem
I'll give you corrosion
Welcome to the nightmare, not the dream.


I can remember everything.
Every promise, every lie,
And how the words of strangers made me cry.
All the pride, all the shame,
All the friends that came from nowhere
And then hurried back again.
I collected scars like a man at war
And I thought 'Isn't life peculiar,
Desire takes you there, but not back.'
No more. I'm just another old story.


When God heard your prayer
It said 'I am not your friend.'
Laughed like a fallen angel
And said 'I've no love to send.'


It keeps a photograph
It likes to overdose on time
It said 'Time to leave'
Like other friends of mine.


I'll give you dark wonders
You are all invited to the show.
I'll give you dominions

I'll keep you here,

I soothe the pain away.
I cure things, sweet young things.
I take the pain away.
I cure things, sweet young things.
Like someone walks on their grave.


I booked a small room in a cheap motel.
Somewhere to hide and a cure to sell.
I call it fashion, I'll make them bleed.
No one to love but a ghost to feed.


I was a puppet pulling my own strings.
I can't believe that I did such things.
I was a shadow but god forgives.
Now I'm a priest and Jesus lives.

By the sound of thinking metal
And I knew something was wrong


I can tell you what fear is
It is the smell of burning
And I'd been close once before

It seemed like forever
How I survived God only knows
I don't like the memory
How I survived God only knows
How I survived God only knows

I'll remember forever
How it all just came apart

Sheltered me

Lied for me
You lived for me


So call me
And I'll run to you
Ask me
And I'd die for you

Like a lifelong friend
And I love you

And you stole mine

But they're all I can find

Call for me

Gary Numan,"Look up I hear the scream of sirens on the wall
I see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying Ford
Hotel waiters leave the bedrooms of stars
Who are far too old
And no-one ever told me
That I could be so cold

Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zero

I see an old man knocked to the ground
And beaten by the vicar's wife
No-one stops to help they're far too busy
Trying to save their own lives
A tiny girl screams for mother
And wanders out into the street
I saw her going down underneath
A thousand people's running feet

Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zero

All the junkies pulling needles from their arms
Hope it lasts all night
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army
And prepare to fight
In silent bars, in silent rooms, in silent cars
You hide where you can
And me I know just where you are, you see
I'm a bomber man

Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zero

Like an alien cure
Searching for my disciples
Dispossessed and alone.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To your corruption.

I took a virgin like Mary
And said ""I give you The One""
I confessed to desire
And watched the world come undone.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To your obsession.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To Heaven.
Your Heaven.

So I moved like a rumour
Like a glorious lie
And I walked into Heaven
Into dead paradise.

Thought I saw the Lord's disciples laugh at that

Bow your head to me.

It came for me at night
And took me dream by dream
To where everything is dark
And no-one hears you scream

And turned love into pain

And I'll make you believe in me.

For all humanity?

Lose your eyes for me.

Betray the world for me
Burn your soul for me.

Cruel and divine
Like the ghost of man.

And now you realise
I am the truth.

Worship the dead

Tortured and bled
Like the voices of reason.

Sanctified obsession
Holy and cured
Like a doorway to heaven.

Purity died
With the angels of passion.

When I'm lonely,
I think of you
And I wonder


And sometimes,
When someone
Calls your name,
I wonder


You changed my life
And you could have changed my world
And I
Miss your voice and
I miss your heartbeat
I miss your face and
I miss you


And sometimes
When I'm sleeping,
I dream of you
And I wonder


And sometimes
When I forget,
I call for you
And I wonder


You said 'goodbye'
Said 'It's over'
You said 'I'm tired
I can't wait
All my life
I won't cry
Anymore'


And sometimes when
I wonder
I cry for you
And I miss you


And sometimes I
Remember
How to feel again
And I miss you

",I Wonder
Gary Numan,"It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing
In a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought
I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals
And issues
And things that I just don't understand
A white lie that night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
'Please sit down'
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed

You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no-one to love

So I found out your reasons
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts
And I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
It must be time to leave
You see it meant everything to me",Are Friends Electric?

If you are my comfort
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.
If you are my answer
Then I must have asked the wrong question.

And broken on the floor 
And I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care
I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch

There's nothing where he used to lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearranged
And she would never be the same again

She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now

And she's learning learning to live

As tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear

A child had died
A woman had been born

As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Gary Scott,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Gary Scott,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Gary Scruggs,"Sweet Sir Galahad 
came in through the window 
in the night when 
the moon was in the yard. 
He took her hand in his 
and shook the long hair 
from his neck and he told her 
she'd been working much too hard. 
It was true that ever since the day 
her crazy man had passed away 
to the land of poet's pride, 
she laughed and talked alot 
with new people on the block 
but always at evening time she cried. 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 

She moved her head 
a little down on the bed 
until it rested softly on his knee. 
And there she dropped her smile 
and there she sighed awhile, 
and told him all the sadness 
of those years that numbered three. 
Well you know I think my fate's belated 
because of all the hours I waited 
for the day when I'd no longer cry. 
I get myself to work by eight 
but oh, was I born too late, 
and do you think I'll fail 
at every single thing I try? 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 

He just put his arm around her 
and that's the way I found her 
eight months later to the day. 
The lines of a smile erased 
the tear tracks upon her face, 
a smile could linger, even stay. 
Sweet Sir Galahad went down 
with his gay bride of flowers, 
the prince of the hours 
of her lifetime. 

And here's to the dawn 
of their days,

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way",My Way

That strips my conscience bare

Time after
Sometimes you picture me 
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time 

If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time",Time After Time
Gary Willner,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Gary Wilmot,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

October nights and big city lights
Will never tear us apart

And your smile still tears me apart

Make a burning field of dreams
Little spark of light touched and grew fed
By all the love that I'm feeling here with you

'Cause being alone is so wrong, it's so cold
When something's right, I know

Gary Wright,"Without you there's no change 
My nights and days are grey 
If I reached out and touched the rain 
It just wouldn't feel the same 

Without you I'd be lost 
I'd slip down from the top 
I'd slide down so low 
Girl you'd never never know

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small 
Let me be me all along 
You let the fires rage inside 
Knowing someday I'd grow strong 

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain 
But I could never climb alone 
I could start another day 
But how many, just don't know 
You're the reason the sun shines down 
And the nights, they don't grow cold 
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young 
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive

Taking off and sputtering whenever it was time to go

With gold and green

Open your eyes, tell me who you wanna be
If you don't know, don't be scared, you're not alone
Your mother's knees are bruised from prayers to keep you home

This is where you are
Don't push, don't shove
This is where you are

Truth or dare, sit and stare at uncovered feet
She's awake because there's no time for her to sleep
If you feel lost, don't be scared, you're not alone
I just told you things I never thought you'd know

But you got thoughts up in your head
You want to lose
But you got caught up in your fists
With what you got to prove

This is where you are
Don't push, don't shove
This is where you are

This is where you are
Don't push, don't shove
This is where you are

You wanna run
You wanna hide
You wanna live

You wanna bleed

What you got to give

I'm gonna wake up and live here today

If you're the circus then am I the rain

All these hidden agendas, they make me smile

But you're no little girl
So stand straight and act your age
No more are you alright conversations
About life and yesterday

You sing to them softly
Sweep them off their feet
With words just like candy
You made them believe

You sold them an angel
And you kept to yourself
Underneath all these faces
Still guiding your hell

But you're no little girl
So stand straight and act your age
No more are you alright conversations
About life and yesterday

Singing years ago we were happy
And some say we are the same
But after all these years you're useless

Gates of Ishtar,"Fallen blind to the demons within
The path to take and I walk it in pain
A darkened mind of destructive taste
My hateful seed grows stronger within
My own hatred - it burns deep inside
My eyes are blind to the demons within
My own hatred - I scream inside
My lips are sealed by the kiss of non-divine
My pain is drowning in the tears I cannot shed
As flowers withers life must come to an end
Can't put me out of my own misery
So I continue on my darkened trail of tears
My own hatred, my trail of tears
My pain is drowning in the tears I cannot shed
My own journey I'll walk to the end
As flowers withers every man has his trails
My own hatred, my trail of tears
My eyes are blind to the demons inside
My own hatred - it grows inside
I hide my fear in the mists of slumbering wine
My constant presence will torment my soul
Like claws from the past, in my eyes shredding tears
Can't put me out of my own misery
So I walk forever on my darkened trail of tears

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings

He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

She left his tired love behind, in a laundromat, in black and white 
The powers that be decided it was time to let him go 
So he went rolling like a tumbleweed across the desert of New Mexico 

And he goes chasing the angel of the blue sky 
And he knows she will be waiting for him there 
And he sees his faithful angel of the blue sky 
Floating in the firmament somewhere 

His Dodge gave out, he stepped into a crowded local bar 
He hitched a ride to Abilene, and wondered how he'd come so far 
The signs they came, the rain fell like a baby's newborn tears 
He stood out on the open plain, and felt her hovering so near 

And he goes... 

All that time it was not wasted 
It was the way it had to be 
Whatever sorrow that he tasted set him free 
Clear blue sky, he smiles to think she's waiting close at hand 
He sets his wet clothes out to dry, then trudges toward the promised land 
Come what may, come whatever makes the world go 'round 
He close his eyes up half the day, and listens for her healing sound 

And he goes...

She's a champion of action 

You ain't never heard her voice, but that's all right

Is like a rhapsody in blue 

Well you ain't never seen no aura in your life 
But you know her's is the color of the sky

When she turns away you die 
It's a tragic situation 

So you drink one down for courage, two for soul 
You drink a third for good luck, then you stroll 
Out onto the dance floor, 
But your feet are too damn cold 
And you need more insulation 

See her spinning round

Oh, she don't love you 
Oh, she don't see you in the crowd 
Oh, if she did she would not want you anyhow 

Expectation lingers in the air 
The problem is that no one else is there

The soul is weakened by love that goes neglected 
The soul is drowning in a sea of sweet perfume and 
Oh, lest we forget, the soul is human

What tangled webs we weave from idle speculation

Beer bottle sweating, she sits peeling off the label 
She'll start regretting this as soon as she is able

I rub the sleep out of my eyes 
I pull the mail box open 
And hope to find a sweet surprise 

I stumble back into the kitchen 
I dump out last night's coffee grinds 
I think the whole thing over 
It's like a movie in my mind 

Well they tell me 
I'm gonna have to carry on without her 
But I'm afraid that ain't the way I got it planned 
I'm gonna take a walk today 
I'll go the old familiar way 
I'll walk up to her and I'll say, 
""I've come to win you back Suzanne."" 

The beauty of this life is changing 
When pressed against the cold, hard facts 
The fact is I got restless 
And you say you ain't coming back 

So hello friendly next door neighbor 
Hello bird up on the wire 
The thought of her surrender 
Spreads through me like a forest fire 

Well they tell me... 

How could you believe that you could get away from me so easy 
What kind of man would let the woman of his dreams just go away 
You said I'd never change before but when I knock upon your door 
You'll see babe, the change in me babe 
I'm on my knees babe 
Looking at you from across the way 

See her diamond earrings sparkle 
Hear the pounding in my chest 
I wish I had a dollar 
For every one of my regrets 

In the distance he's approaching 
The ghost of who I might have been 
As I walk home alone my 
Memory's my only friend 

Well they tell me....

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.

And in his name all oppression shall cease.

Gatsbys American Dream,"I head for distant lands
Leaving my expenses
Forsake this land of plastic
I would try to be something but you won't stop talking
Drifting for the farthest shore
I would try to be something but you won't stop debating
Try to find ways so I can start living
Its been said the things you buy they own you
But they don't own me anymore
This time things will be different

Gauvain Sers,"J'habite ici depuis trente ans 
Comme mes parents et puis les leurs 
Ceux qui ramenaient de la mine d’antan 
Un peu de charbon dans leur sueur 
Je viens du Nord de l'hexagone 
On est dimanche il est vingt heures 
C'est ma terre depuis que je suis môme 
Mais là, j'y ai honte d'y être facteur 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine dans ses suffrages 
Moi je déménage 
Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine dans ses suffrages 
Je déménage 
Je déménage 

Sous la terre de l'hécatombe 
Je pense à mon grand-père enterré 
Il doit se retourner dans sa tombe 
Vu qu'il peut plus déménager 
Je préfère qu'il reste dans le noir 
Comme l'étaient ses ongles à la mine 
Et je suis pas sûr qu'il voudrait voir 
Flotter le drapeau bleu Marine 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine sur ses visages
Moi je déménage

Je suis rien de plus qu'un petit facteur 
Qui va au marché le mardi 
Et qui est très observateur 
Quand j'cligne de l'œil, j'photographie 
Et si je te dis bonjour des yeux 
En tendant tes lettres, tes factures 
Je sais qu'il y a une chance sur deux 
Que t'ai voté pour une ordure

Comme si le chômage a vingt pour-cents 
Rendait la bêtise transmissible

Et même des immigrés aussi 
Comme si se tirer une balle dans le pied 
faisait courir plus vite Pardi 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom

Mais vu que la haine n'est plus en cage 
Moi je déménage 
Elle avait pourtant un beau nom

Gauvain Sers,"Mon petit chez moi est très spacieux
Puisqu'il occupe le tout Paname
J’ai pas le soleil, j’ai mal aux yeux
De voir défiler toutes ces rames
Je change tout les soirs de station
Pour tenter de briser ma routine
Aucun loyer, aucune caution
J’suis un clodo sur toute la ligne

Je maîtrise le moindre changement
Les raccourcis, les petits couloirs
C’est quand même mon appartement
Mais j’ai du monde qui passe me voir
J’ai plus aucune intimité
Pas les moyens pour une consigne
Enfin au moins je suis abrité
Je suis un clodo sur toute les lignes

J’observe les gens, leur quotidiens
Toutes les godasses des parisiens

Je me fais refouler, parce que je refoule
Pour oublier alors, je me saoule
Et puis je guette les uniformes
Les mêmes qui veulent pas que je dorme
J’crois que j’ai la phobie des insignes
Je suis un clodo sur toute la ligne

Je le connais sur le bout des doigts
Mon discours récité mille fois
Pour une pièce, un ticket resto
J’suis le perroquet du métro
Mais je ne travaille jamais le dimanche
C’est un métier de faire la manche
C’est mon crédo pour rester digne
Je suis un clodo qui suit sa ligne

Quand je bois le double d’un pack de seize
Je vois très trouble la ligne treize
Quand je bois rien, mon strapontin
A parfois le droit a un voisin
Et c’est le genre de petits plaisirs
Que tu piges pas ça va sans dire
Et je te le souhaites pas
Ça serait le signe que t’es le clodo qui écrit ces lignes
Putain, c’que c’est marrant la vie
Quand j’étais môme, bah moi aussi, 
J’évitais de lire dans leur regard
Toute la détresse de ces clochards
Mais aujourd'hui, j’ai changé de camps
Un seul bonjour, et je suis content
C’est comme si je gagnais au loto
Sur toute la ligne
Je suis un clodo",Un Clodo sur toute la ligne
Gauvain Sers,"Plein coeur du marais
Sous des poutres apparentes
Rambuteau c’est l’arrêt
Si jamais ça te tente
À peine franchis la porte
Qu’on s’y sent comme chez soit
Comme dans le salon d’un pote
Où le comptoir est en bois
Et ça trinque au bon vin
Devant l’écharpe de Maurice
Jusqu'aux heure du matin
Où les métro se remplissent
Un peu comme chez Leprest
Quand on y est, on y reste
Tout est beau, même l’ardoise
Chez Françoise

On récite de vieux textes
De Dimé ou d’Alain
Avec pour seul prétexte
Que leur plumes font du bien
Et Françoise elle revit
De voir que des gamins
Apprivoisent des écrits
Qu’on laissé les anciens
On trinque pour eux ici
Et c’est là que tout se passe
On est toujours assit
La même table, la même place
Un peu comme chez Leprest
Quand on y, est on y reste
Tout est beau, même l’ardoise

Faut baisser la tête pour aller aux toilettes
Les plus petits se sentent grands
Juste le temps d’un instant
Il faut pas tourner le dos
Pour voir les vieilles photos
Les grands se sentent petits
Devant ces tranches de vie
Et quand la taulière sort
Les cendriers cachés
Non Paris n’est pas mort
Personne ira dénoncer
Un peu comme chez Leprest
Quand on y est, on y reste
Tout est beau, même l’ardoise
Chez Françoise

On mange des discussions
Et on parle plats du jour
On boit de la bonne chanson
On chante, on chante toujours
La guitare change de mains
Elle fait le tour de la table
Comme l’aiguille fait le sien
Au mur du Connétable
Si dans fond de nos verres
Il y traine des oreilles
Tout ceux qui sont en l’air
Sous nos plus belle bouteilles
Un peu comme si Leprest
Nous laissait quelques restes

Gauvain Sers,"Je me souviens comme si c’était hier
Du jour où on s’est rencontré
Et quand j’ai avoué à ta mère
Que t’étais celle que j’attendais
Je me souviens d’une première manif
Lancer des œufs sur leurs carreaux
Je suis pas passé loin du boure-pif
Quand je l’ouvrais un petit peu trop
Je me souviens bien de ma première bière
Mais pas de celles qui ont suivi
La première fois tu m’as souri
J’m’en souviens comme si c’était hier

J’me souviens comme si c’était hier
De jouer au cow-boy sur ma chaise
Frapper à deux mains mes revers
Pleurer les deux tours New-Yorkaises
Je me souviens d’un problème de maths
Avec une baignoire à remplir
Et je me souviens d’une petite boite
Où j’entassais tout mes souvenirs
J’me souviens de la voix de ma grand-mère
Les pots de confitures sur la tables
Le Monopoly ou le Scrabble
J’m’en souviens comme si c’était hier

J’me souviens comme si c’était hier
D'avoir Paris à ma fenêtres
Pour un creusois de souche, c’est clair
C’est comme changer de planète
Je me souviens d’une guitare mi-longue
Et des ratures dans un cahier
Mais disons que ma première chanson
J’essaye encore de l’oublier

J’me souviens comme si c’était hier
Des journées de colères profonde
Quand une usine passe pas l’hiver
Et qu’une ordure dirige le monde
Je me souviens et je me souviendrais
Pour raconter à mon marmot
Quand il demandera comment c’était
En ajustant son sac à dos
J’me souviendrais bien sur aussi
Que ce coup de fil a tout changé
Et alzheimer peut s’accrocher
Ça tombera jamais dans l’oubli",Comme si c’était hier

J’adorais déjà faire le pitre
Faire des grands signes aux autres voitures

Nos vieilles cassettes collector
Société tu les auras pas
Société, tu les auras pas

Je me prenais, pour une rock star

Il le paye ensuite comptant
Puisqu'il consomme plus au litre

Sans remarquer qu’à l’avant garde

La serveuse a laissé ses tasses

Elle a rendez-vous sur la place

Quand il a terminé sa bière

S’en vient pisser sur mon parterre

Même en hiver je ne crains rien

Un sot-l’y-laisse pour trois, un morceau de blanc pour deux
C’est une galette des rois où tout le monde gagne un peu
Même les végétariens, ne manqueraient ça pour rien
Personne peut être étanche, au poulet du dimanche

Tout le monde l’a vécu et chacun y a gouté
Je crois que même le sécu pense à le faire rembourser
Je pourrai te parler des heures de ses vertus sociales

Mais le boucher va fermer, et je veux pas me retrouver

Si t’as baigné dans une culture
C’est bien dans celle des haricots
Que tu équeutais à la dure
Sur une pile de vieux journaux

En écoutant l’ancienne France Bleue
Tu le mets toujours d’ailleurs ce pull

You, through the grapevine, heard the truth
It's good to learn from your mistakes
But that only works in youth

There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love

Restless minds, curtain calls follow fanfares
Troubled hearts, just a walk down the hall
Restless hearts, you take a punch just to land one
Troubled minds, it's only fair after all

Mounting, the trail, but you've got it in sight
Sometimes the only way is jumping
I hope you're not afraid of heights
Reach in my pocket for a bill that isn't there
And to face all of the undoings
Still isn't more than I can bear

Love has a reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love

Love, love

It's always been good to me

Or who I'm supposed to be

I don't want to be anything other than me
I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by impostors everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave

The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately

I'm love sick somewhere tonight

I felt it for so long
Am I even on your mind
Or are you now in

Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves
I'm a jealous guy
I hear people talk
And it isn't hard to believe
I think you cheated on me

I've been this love sick before
I've felt just like this before

There was another just like you
I loved her for so long
But I had poison on my mind
And I drove her into

[Chorus]

I've said I've had this stage before
But I left an open door
For this to walk into my life

And maybe I suspect too much
But this is hard for me to trust
When I'm all wound up inside
I just drive you often into

Gavin DeGraw,"When your feathers are soaked and your eyes are too bloody to see,
And you pulled every punch that you had but there's one that you need,
Then you've waited too long,
There's a hole in your heart,
And all you've become is emotionally overrun

[Chorus]
Wishing wells were made to echo a dime,
The consequences are you keep on relying,
You've become a run and hide refugee,
Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me

You're gonna get hooked if there's anything left I can do,
You've already disarmed it's your lasting alarm I pursue,
You can loosen those fists,
C'mon blow me a kiss,
You've been roughed up enough to deserve some relief from your troubles,
So I'm coming in

[Chorus]

Otherwise, I would never tell you what to do despite,
Any indecision though I know I'm right,
Arguing was always my forte,
And one thing I can say is I won't tell you lies,
Or treat you like a rental car like other guys,
And if you think I'm crazy find an alibi,
Cause you will need some evidence to show

[Chorus]

Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me",Cop Stop
Gavin DeGraw,"Whenever I see you I need more
And want you to stay 'til the end

Will you just smile at me again

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you girl I never want to break up

The difference I'm feeling in my heart
Is the difference of loving or not
And under the stars and moon and sun
Is the perfect becoming of one

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you girl I never want to break up

If I told you that I loved like an ace
Then I'd be lying 'cause I've made some mistakes
But I'm trying with perfect faith
When I let you in
I began to win
And now I'm just all gold
After all I've done
And the road I've run
I want to thank you

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up

Don't let nobody put you down, who your with
Take the pain of protecting your name,
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,

And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]

Out the many broken back doors and windows,
Through the valley of the love of the lost,
Is a hole that is cut through the souls falling down
From the thrones without leaving any windows,
But you drown in a piece for the moment,
The moment was over in time,
Then its gone the hit and run the tactless one has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,

And she knows how to treat a fella right,

Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]

Gonna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach,
Now I know there's nothing we cant preach,
Cause the heart can't erase once it
Finds a place to be warm and welcome,
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,

Just don't medicate me""

Tell 'em, ""Say no to drugs""

One who knows best for you
Paid for those tests for you
Knows how to get you through

Cause it's high to climb,
You hear them saying,

Filed through legal means

Tie him to extension cords,

And all is relative, relative
Everything is relative, yes it is

It's all about the way we receive it
How much we believe it
Depending on the life you lead, if you lead it

The color of the skin in your blood, and how you got it
Compare it to yourself

the head trip parade
Without any experience
You become curious prey

Designed to be opened with your childish behavior

Gavin DeGraw,"Why do the men stray
Why do the women pray
Why do the men fight
Why do the women sympathize

Whoa it was easier before I loved
Before this heart was turned to stone
Before this blood was stirred and blood was spilled
No one was ever meant to be alone

Why do the birds sing
What do they call that thing
Why do the bombs boom
We're running out of living room

Our needs getting needier and needier
More lies are told until they're truth
Until the messages are massacred
Old men get all their killing done with youth

Why do the men stray
Why do the women pray
Why do the men fight
Why do the women sympathize

Light themselves on fire in turn
Oh but someday there will be nothing left to burn
Oh someday there will be nothing left to burn

That's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope
Hope there's a conversation
Where we both admit we had it good
But until then
It's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

Damn
Damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
And still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around
And I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

And if I had the chance
To renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And I turned away and told you should take another look?
You said you’d see what’s going on
I know you trust but something’s wrong

We have our lives to bear
Our bags to burden
But we just buy and we wear
The plastic version of
Love, hope, understanding
But we can’t survive on candy

Can take your mind
Away from anything
And I wanna die
At every mention of “celebrity”
Like “who’s doing who”
Just how and where
Long as it’s not you
I just don’t care

Running far away from all your serious concerns
I know you’ve learned to you use your fairy tales
To get you through the hurt
Who’s falling? We’re falling
And there’s just no climbing back
So I’m slowin’, I'm stallin’
While I’m under full attack

Hey

I'll lay it down
One time through
Gather round
Though this is a chore

So rich realize
I prefer poor advice
And showed her the door

This is your goodbye in case opportunity
Thought you were burning me down, but I'm finally free

If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Oh the sun came up
Tell me, where'd I park?
We did it again
We had some fun, did some things, we got drunk
But I want it to end

'Cause I only give in when I get the need
I'm only coming around 'cause I get to leave

If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Can't read, I can't see
Thinking 'bout the mess that you're in
Some things I couldn't see
What about the rest of you?
Well you're under my skin
But I can't let you in
Though you don't see scars
That's exactly what they are baby

So many and it’s turning me on inside out
I know a woman’s nature
There’s nothing you can save here
Me, I run every time

We got two tickets but they're one way
And I went with it so I can’t say no
I lit a fuse I can’t stop
I opened doors I can’t lock
Still, I never meant to be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

So I told her get a head start
Like the last one I didn’t have the heart
To tell her straight
I know how she’ll receive it
And I can’t bear to see it
That’s why I never meant to be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

And I hope she sees
It’s not her, it’s just me
And I’m so sorry
To be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

I’m close and let it slip away

Gavin DeGraw,"Where did all the people go?
They got scared when the lights went low.
I'll get you through it nice and slow,
When the world's spinning out of control.

Afraid of what they might lose
Might get scraped or they might get bruised.
You could beg them, what's the use?
That's why it's called a moment of truth

I'll get it if you need it,
I'll search if you don't see it,
You're thirsty, I'll be rain,
You get hurt, I'll take your pain.

I know you don't believe it,
But I said it and I still mean it,
When you heard what I told you,
When you get worried I'll be your soldier.

Funny when times get hard,
At the last moment when you're supposed to charge,
Always on the longest yard,
Oh, they feel their feet getting cold.

Hiding here, hiding there,
Find them underneath the stairs,
People hiding everywhere,
Trying to be still like a stone.

I'll get it if you need it,
I'll search if you can't see it,
You're thirsty, I'll be rain,
You get hurt, I'll take your pain.

I know you don't believe it,
But I said it and I still mean it,
When you heard what I told you,
When you get worried I'll be your soldier.

My aim is so true,
I wanna show you,
I'll try forever,
I'm never gonna say ""surrender"".

I'll get it if you need it,
I'll search if you can't see it,
You're thirsty, I'll be rain,
You get hurt, I'll take your pain.

I know you don't believe it,
But I said it and I still mean it,

I'll be your soldier",Soldier
Gavin DeGraw,"With my eyes wide open
And with words unspoken
I still understand

And I'm reading your mind
Using every outline
You're drawing in my hand

Ooo, feel your fingers
Ooo, I'm in way too deep

To wake up
Step out
Cause I'm really getting used to being in this dream
You know what I mean I
Can't find
Any reason I would ever wanna turn back now
Once you spelled it out

Oh, when I first met you
There were things I'd been through
That I would never tell

But it was almost as if
You already knew my language
Cause you'd been there yourself

Ooo, I'm still falling
Ooo, don't make me return

And wake up
Step out
Cause I'm really getting used to being in this dream
You know what I mean I
Can't find
Any reason I would ever wanna turn back now
Once you spelled it out

I know it's not an accident
I can feel it crashing in
And I'm not pushing back

Come on, we can leave the world behind
Close the curtains, shut out the light
Just state the good
Don't let me go
Don't tell me I should

Wake up
Step out

Gavin DeGraw,"You might really be
The very best woman to ever suit me
But I can’t expect you to see how I see
Cause sometimes I don’t see a thing
But personal pressure is making me guess
My time’s running out as we’re both getting dressed
I don’t know who’s body I’d rather feel pressed
But I cannot arrest on my thoughts

[Chorus]
Cause we had a good time
Then it was sorrow
I call it stealing
You call it borrow
So I want my heart back
If you’re not gonna keep it
If you’ve got no uses
Then I’m gonna need it
And someone else
Is gonna need it too

While some of it’s here
I’m wondering where did the rest disappear
The parts that I thought were the best are unclear
Or hiding there under your doubt
So maybe we’ll call this a hard lesson learned
But you’re holding something that I’ll need returned
If you need some time
I’ve still got some to burn
But burning is just running thin

[Chorus]

What would the point be
If we let this thing drag out
Failing to accept
These impressions passed around
Oh, you and I
It’s been a wild ride
And I wouldn’t change at all
But I’m gonna let you know

You don't know how lucky you are

Went to school and found out you're dumb
Maybe you just had too much fun
Fell in love and think it's the one

Is a moment I choose to embrace

Live, you don't have to look back
But if you ever do,
You know where I'm at

The thought of you to disappear
Shutting the door and walking out of here
To know there's something you must find
That I never had, believe me that I tried

I failed algebra and I misused some times
We're at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you can't smoke inside

You said ""Take me home, I can't stand this place
'Cause there's too many hipsters and I just can't relate""
You're my neon gypsy, my desert rain
You're my ""Helter Skelter"", oh how can I explain that

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
I'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
And maybe once a year, I think they'll clean my car

Caught my reflection, drop the call
I've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I can't see straight
I got obligations though I'm usually late but

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

But I passed the longest sign on the interstate
Saying ""Find someone before it gets too late""

Walked through quite enough
Had to call it a day
From an ex who showed up falling to
Grand piano falling on the edge of the parkway
Got no good advice Hotline called me twice
Said, ""I went through the wall
Do you have a quote to lend me
Or a friend to send me?""
But I got no help at all

So I loosened my lips
And let a little prayer I memorized
Do what I just wished
And suddenly, to my surprise

Oh, DJ, when you play my song
Make me feel bigger than an old King Kong
At the risk of this coming out wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on
Oh, every time I hear that jam
Grabbed my baby right by her hand
Even if my day was going all wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on

Turned it right up to the sky
You're my absolutely fictional
Pure perfection my Venetian boat ride
Blown out speakers and worn out tweeters
And still I get the effect
If you got my go-to living
Even get me in the spirit
Even if I'm a complete wreck

Don't you call it a flaw
Everybody needs some a peace of mind
It should be the law

How good it could be
I knew it would be somehow 
And now I know now that it is

Some days when her eyes shine, her thoughts are black
Like a little child she can do no wrong
And I'll pick her up each time she falls down

Night's scent is her presence, night's secret her face.
I speak when she's sleeping, silent when she wakes.
Clouds gather and darken, our future foretell
Rains comin' often and loves a brief spell
Like the saddest word, she awaits her song
And I'll pick her up each time she falls down

I never thought it was me they're after
When I was dreaming that I was 22
That I was twenty two

La da da, oh, oh

And I remember the cold, cold mornings
I never thought it was me they're wanting
When I was dreaming oh la da da
When I was dreaming oh oh oh
When I was dreaming that I was 22
That I was twenty two",22

'Cause now you don't remember my name

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change,

Gravity like lunar landing
You make me wanna run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But, love remains the same

Find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city bus sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I have to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But, love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me now
We shall overcome
So all that's left is praying

But we, should have had the sun
We could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change

I wish this could last forever

as if we could last forever

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

In a sunshine reflection

And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had

notti di sirene in quella periferia
si dice che di tutti noi ha un po' nostalgia
ma lei se ne è andata Mary....

Si sente sola Mary
ora ha paura Mary
l'ho vista piangere poi chiedere una risposta al cielo Mary
e ora il suo sguardo non mente
ha gli occhi di chi nasconde alla gente
gli abusi osceni del padre ma non vuol parlarne Mary
e cela i suoi dolori in ogni foglio del diario che ora ha tra le mani
e guardando vecchie foto chiede aiuto ad una preghiera
sui polsi i segni di quegli anni chiusi in una galera
la madre che sa tutto e resta zitta
ora il suo volto porta i segni di una nuova sconfitta e
l'ho vista girar per la città senza una meta
dentro lo zaino i ricordi che le han sporcato la vita
tradita da chi l'ha messa al Mondo
e in secondo sul suo corpo
i segni di un padre che per Mary adesso è morto è
stanca Mary non ha più lacrime ed ora chiede al destino un sorriso
chiuso in un sogno la sera ma....

dicono che Mary se n'è andata via

Mary che cammina su sentieri più scuri
stai cercando sorrisi sinceri oltre i muri di questa città
oh Mary camminando su sentieri più scuri sul diario segreto scrivevi
""quella bestia non è mio papà""

ora ripenso a quando mi parlavi in lacrime
dicevi questa vita non la cambio ma ci sto provando sto pregando ma
sembra inutile e abbracciandomi dicesti tornerò....

hey guarda c'è Mary
è tornata in stazione
sai stringe la mano a due persone
il suo bel viso ha cambiato espressione
senza più gocce di dolore
ora la bacia il sole bacia il suo uomo e la bimba nata dal suo vero amore
con quel suo sorriso che da senso a tutto il resto protetto
da un mondo sposrco che ha scoperto troppo presto
ha un'anima ferita un'innocenza rubata
sa che è la vita non una fiaba ma ora
Mary è tornata una fata

cammina lenta ma sembra che sia contenta, attenta
una sfida eterna aspetta ma non la spaventa
era altrove e suo padre ora ha smesso di vivere Mary
fissa la sua lapide versare lacrime è impossibile 

Si chiedono ma è Mery quella in fondo alla via??è riuscita a crescere
tornata con il giorno in quella ferrovia fresca di rugiada parla di sè
Mary senza nostalgia stanca ormai di piangere
lei sa quanto dura questa vita sia
ma lei l'ha cambiata

E in sottofondo mettere buona musica questa la voglio me la stacco dalla pagina è la più vecchia c'è tutta la comitiva sembra persino che anche il sole sorrida quanto sembriamo diversi sempre gli stessi alcuni si sono persi ma noi ci siamo ancora e allora scatta subito così per sempre avremo accanto il nostro pubblico

We share a life in one dimension
Our problems always seem to cloud the sky
But we don't pay them much attention

And with every day
We drift apart
I can feel it in my heart
That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly

No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
And we should take it as a warning
We keep on going through the old routines
Exchanging kisses in the morning

And with every day we drift apart
And the fear is in my heart
I read the signs and I should be mature
And yet a child could not be more unsure

There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
Our passion's just a distant memory

And in its place a dull frustration
A cold indifference where there used to be
At least a frequent irritation
But a feeling still

Of tenderness
And of pity, so I guess
I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
If he should need someone to hold him tight

He's like a child
But I feel my love die

That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so

And you see them claiming to be wild and free
Holding their young grey hearts in their hands

Sweet boy press your hand against my lips
You got to stop me trying to make sense of it all
And whisper
I'll race you to the edge
And we'll open up our arms and just fall

We cannot stop the wheel
Cannot stop the wheel
From turning

We cannot stop the wheel
Cannot stop the wheel
So let's just enjoy the ride

Cannot stop the wheel
Embrace the down side
Follow the landslide

Gotta meet you face to face
Convince you that I'm not so strange

I'm broken down
But I'm okay, upbeat when you come around
I'm happy sad and it comes easy to me

You know you make me want to try harder

Gen,"Dance in Sand and Sea
So here we are, or rather, here I am, quite alone,
I'm seeing things that were shared before, long ago 
My memory stretches and I am dazed: you know I know
How good the time was and how I laughed 
Times have changed, now you're far away, I can't complain:
I had all my chances but they slipped right through my hands - like so much sand;
I know I'll never dance like I used to

I'll just wait till day breaks upon the land and the sea.
Hoping that I can catch all of the memories,
Then I must crawl off upon my way, all of me
Listening hard for the final words.
But there are none; the sunrise calls, I've lingered on
Too close for comfort and I don't know quite why
I feel like crying 
I know we'll never dance like we used to.

I look up, I'm almost blinded by the warmth of what's inside me
And the taste that's in my soul,
But I'm dead inside as I stand alone 

Dance in Frost
I wore my moods like so many different sets of clothes
But the right one was never around;
And as you left I heard my body ring
And my mind began to howl
It was far to late to contemplate the meaning of it all:
You know that I need you, but somehow I don't think
You see my love at all

At some point I lost you, I don't know quite how it was;
The wonderland lay in a coat of white, chilling frost
I looked around and I found I was truly lost:
Without your hand in mine I am dead 
Reality is unreal and games I've tried just aren't the same:
Without your smile there's nowhere to hide
And deep inside
I know I've never cried as I'm about to 

If I could just frame the words that would make your fire burn
All this water now around me could be the love that
Should surround me.

Looking out through the tears that bind me
My heart bleeds that you may find me .. or at least that I can
Forget and be numb, but I can't stop, the words still come:
I love you",Lost

Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago,
The fear of getting caught,
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away,
Replaced by everyday

September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?

You I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me,

Gene Ammons,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy

Gene Ammons,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard

Gene Ammons,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Gene Ammons,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Long as love is sure

Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near

Gene Ammons,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?
Gene Ammons,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All
Gene Ammons,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Gene Ammons,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Is black de root, is blonde de hair. 
Her eyelash false, her face is paint, 
And pads are where de girl she ain't

But calypso girl is good a lot, 
Is what you see, is what she got.

And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death

Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.

Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel.
I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of adventures and battles,
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me feel I'm home.
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.

When you and I had strolled away
And suddenly a storm grew nigh
Seeking shelter from the rain
We hurried down a little lane
Found a lovely spot nearby

T'was just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raise their pretty heads
A purfumed ""thank you"" they seemed to say

Surely here was charm beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that I was there with you?

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Maybe you'd like to pull up a chair and help me sing it

A long long time ago
As all you folks should know
Ol' Santa started loading up his sleigh
A smile on every face
Each reindeer took his place
To bring the children joy on Christmas Day
With one little, two little, three little reindeer
(Four little, five little, six little reindeer)
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

(There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen)
But there's one little reindeer missing, Rudolf is his name

For a long, long time
He had hitched up nine
To make his Christmas ride
Now Rudolph's gone
He's so alone
Santa Claus sat down and cried

With one little, two little, three little reindeer
(Four little, five little, six little reindeer)
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer

(Hey Santa, look, look who's coming)

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Made the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when
Before their eyes
He came to life that day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Now before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye

The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me

How could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky

Still hears my broken song of love

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose

Gene Autry,"Santa works all day in his workshop
Making lots of games and toys
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh
To bring them to the girls and boys
Santa's just as nice as he can be
There's just one little thing that worries me.

If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh
In case of rain, will there be a train
That'll speed him on his way
If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How will Santa get around to us
If he breaks down on his way to town
Will they let him use a bus?
I sent him a nice long letter
And I hope it's not in vain
I'd really feel much better
If I knew he could fly a plane.

People say he has eight reindeer
For the sleigh he's driving here
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow
On Christmas this year.

Gene Autry,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted ?On Dasher? and each reindeer?s name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
?Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!?",The Night Before Christmas Song
Gene Autry,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You
Gene Bertoncini,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Gene Bertoncini,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Seeing images in the firelight

Flash bright in candlelight through Sunday's early morn
We found a room that rainy morning

She took my hand through winding roads and led me home
Some red French wine when later waking
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair

She laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French café
Had no English words for me

So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings, I never knew her name
You're bound to lose, she's too much for you
She'll leave you lost one rainy morn, you won't be the same

She laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again

And the heroes she has witnessed fall
While the hallway leaves them 
All blank to the ceiling 
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone, 
Bringing her, her every dream
Beneath the deep and broken wall
The reflecting glass of time it falls
Through the crack she said 
She heard the ocean calling
The foghorn cries profanity
At the master of insanity
As she watches ruins, needing me and sobbing

Throw your troubles to the moon trolls 
To swallow up like stormy dreams

Looking if there's such a strife 

And you say you lost your baby, 
Wondering if its in your life 
Well you fly your banners Mondays,

Kinda gives you the feeling you've been used
When its only a matter of things that's been confused
Well now, she wasn't no loser
If you will investigate
But if you're thinking to choose her
You better think when its late
I'm beginning to feel she's not around at all
Had me running high strung, feeling small
Nobody could find her though they looked that day
What kind of thought had designed her
Go on out on a cloud
They say that's where she would stay
Well, I couldn't believe her
No, I couldn't believe her
I couldn't believe her
No, I couldn't believe her
I couldn't believe her",Couldn't Believe Her
Gene Clark,"On the streets you look again
At the places you have been
Or the moments that you thought
Where am I going
Though the walls are like the dead
They reflect the things you've said
And the echoes in your head continue showing
Near the castles you can build
Out of dreams you half fulfilled
Won't keep out all of the ill wind that is blowing
And you look still for a trace
Of an opening in a place
Where you find the life that you were used to knowing
You can walk out in the night
And be sure that its alright
To exaggerate the world that's only being
You can watch Regina dance
Through the crystal panes of glass
Yet you know that there's so much that she's not seeing
Still you hold one precious thought
After all this time you've sought
That she might be just protecting what she longs for
And her eyes are veiled with black
Cause she plays she can look back
At the love she wanted so but says is no more
The lights go on, commence the cold
As your senses will be sold
To the parrot watchers mimicing no reasons
To pretend that what they are
From the fact completely far
While the truth may be betrayal, lies and treason
Build their towers in the sand
Down the roads at their command
When the kingdom is the innocence they're stealing
And infection easily spreads
To the searching, twisted heads
As they team up to tear down each others feeling",Echoes
Gene Clark,"She was an elevator operator she had  her ups and downs
She got so high so very fast it took her all day to come down
I'm gonna put you straight to her right now
She's very busy but I'll explain somehow

Elevator operator, elevator operator
She was one of the girls that you make feel 
That you were up to stay 
But when you began to think it was real
She took you down all the way

I'm gonna put you straight to her right now 
I'm gonna have to get along without her now",Elevator Operator
Gene Clark,"Well I knew at the moment when I saw you
I could feel you close to me across the room
Last night, oh all right
I found you
What went down there I knew could never leave me
It was that feeling, girl, I got from you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

It's been much too easy to remember sometimes
How empty handed loneliness can be
But when you were there to ease my mind
There was so much of something that I need
All the changes in the places at the time when
You were there and then at once I was with you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

Last night, I said, all right
I found you",I Found You
Gene Clark,"Is yours is mine
Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds
Is this day and this time
Is yours is mine
I walked along the walls and there I saw your name
I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game
The stormy weather passed and left me here to find
That the rain and the shine
Is yours is mine
Is yours is mine",Is Yours Is Mine
Gene Clark,"Keep your feet on the ground
Don't let'em bring you down
All you got to do is keep on pushin'
All the things they say

Won't always work that way
Satisfy your mind and keep on pushin'
All I ever want to see
Baby, please, that you're not down on me

Every time I call, call up on you
All you got to do is keep on pushin'
All the things you do
You got to see 'em through

Satisfy your mind and keep on pushin'
All I ever want to see
Baby, please, that you're not down on me",Keep on Pushin'
Gene Clark,"You say that you need
Someone you can depend on
I say that I need somebody too
So put your mind at ease
You know that you can count on
Me for anything you want me to do
I should have told you before
But this time you got through to me 
So much more
So much more
You say that you need
A way to make your mind up
I need to find out which way to go
If you think you see me
Then maybe we will windup
Bringing back the time that I miss so          
You know that there's so much we can do
We could have everything we need 
Before we're through and more before we're through

Ah, la la la la 
La la la
Ah",Needing Someone
