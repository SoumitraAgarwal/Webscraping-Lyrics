Song of Turtle
And the Cry of the Bear
Awake
I can sense it
Still I'm afraid
Tower Road lies ahead
Commala-come-ka
Ka has come to me
Grey old fellow
If you finally failed the test
What would it mean?
We're getting near
We're getting near
Maid of sorrow
Your time goes by

Fade away
Fade

""Say thank, ya"" for the beams are safe my friend
Long days and pleasant nights for you

Save me
The final chord
Don't let it end like this
No, not like this
Tell me
When things were finally getting out of hand
It's out of hand

Entangled, I am captured
You have put a spell on me
The last in line
The Gunslinger's line
The sacrifice of innocence
This work needs to be done
Now blow the horn
Hail to the gun!

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
Every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control

Save me
To touch the rose it will not bring release
No taking back
Come save me
There are other worlds
But surely none like this
The world has changed

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
The word is the law
Law is Ka

The end of the road lies
Straight ahead it lies
I'm feeling pure
The end of the road lies

The sacrifice of innocence
The hailing of the gun
My way was death and madness
Now let the tower come

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
And every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control",The Gunslinger
Demons & Wizards,"Here in the shadows 
There's no wishing well 
May the Blessed one forgive me 
Like so many times before 
There's no saviour at the door 
It won't matter anymore 

Touch me now while we reach the end, 
I wonder where you are right now, right now, 
Oh my dear 

She still has sunshine in her weary eyes 
A bed of roses to testify my love 
A promise made, now I will make a try 
There is no power in earth to tear us apart 

Love's tragedy asunder 
Oh, set your spirit free 
Love's tragedy asunder 
Do I believe 

Deep in the shadows there's no release 
(I believe) Deep in the shadows you won't find peace 
(I believe) We live in a dreamworld, it's over now 
I'll take your hand, our time is sure to come 

On broken wings I try to fly 
I'm sorry I will get it by 
All praise and glory, 
All praise and glory to love 

I've buried sunlight when I shutter eyes 
Dead leaves to dust, the seasons bloom 
A glimpse of Heaven showed an angel cry 
Tenfold the cries of Crack of Doom 

Love's tragedy asunder 
Wanted peace for me 
Love's tragedy asunder 
Will I be free 

Love's tragedy asunder 
Will I be free 
Love's tragedy asunder 
Falling misery 
Love's tragedy asunder 
Do I believe 
Love's tragedy asunder 
Still I believe",Love's Tragedy Asunder
Demons & Wizards,"On and on this is my way 
I've made up my mind 
But will I find what I search for 
Soon I will reach the western shore 

Far behind in the distance 
Lie the fires of doom 
There's a voice deep inside me 
""The tower knows who you are"" 

The road goes on and on 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
The road goes on and on 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 

I hear him say ""We'll seize the day"" 

Too many roads we've travelled on 
We'll seize the day 
Now there's one thing left to lose 
We'll seize the day 
Until the end we'll carry on 
We'll seize the day 
Now there's one thing left to lose 
We'll seize the day 

All along this is my way 
I've better move on 
Pure in heart and fair-minded 
For strength and truth I keep on 

Keep the one that is passed on 
And leave the others behind 
All alone and without me 
I hear him say ""We'll seize the day"" 

Too many roads we've travelled on 
We'll seize the day 
Now there's one thing left to lose 
We'll seize the day 
Until the end we'll carry on 
We'll seize the day 
Now there's one thing left to lose 
We'll seize the day 

So stay with me we'll carry on

Demons & Wizards,"There is a demon
An evil mind
Inside us
Oh I know, I know
We all know the rules
When water will be shed
The wicked witch is

This is the end of all the miracles
Farewell to you yellow brick road

Everything she is asking for
It all belongs to her
Now she's gone into nothingness
There she waits

Still I can hear her singing in the room
In the room I know she's gone
I've thought ""She'll never fail,
All magic will be gone
The day she'll melt away""

This is the end of all the miracles
Still I hear her singing in the dark
Truth has changed, her voice it stays the same
Farewell to you yellow brick road
Still I hear her singing in the dark
While time goes on her voice will fade away

Silver shoes you're mine, you are mine,
You are mine""

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas's be white

I can see my feelings growing every day.
After loving half way through the night
I can feel my heart beat in a special way.

Visualize a very cozy place
waking up into the morning sun

Squint my eyes and when I see your face -
I know that day by day if you're the loving kind
You'll see that day by day you'll make me loose my mind.

In the evening spent a lovely day
Always near you
never felt this good before

Got a feeling want you to stay
'Cause you seem to be what I've been looking for.
Takes a while before I give my heart

Den Harrow,"Stockin' away all the details you want to know
Day after day all your memories get to grow
Putting all that you've stolen
In a prison that you've locked forever
Taking the place of our imagination
But you won't erase my heart

There is no way you can understand what I feel
You never pray 'cause your soul isn't even real
You might know lots of things now
But you can never be a lover
Winning the race with your information
But you can't replace my soul

Future brain you make me wonder
Is it sane to make a sample of my love
Future brain you're getting stronger
It's a shame you'll never know how to find love

Living today but tomorrow will be the same
I know I can say that you will never win this game
No matter how much you know now
You will never get to know us never
Taking the place of an institution
But you can't replace my love

Future brain you make me wonder
Is it sane to make a sample of my love
Future brain you're getting stronger
It's a shame you'll never know how to find love

Future brain you great computer
It's insane to program everybody's love

But you're to blame 'cause you don't know
How stupid you are

Dena DeRose,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?

How many times a day do I think of you?

Dena DeRose,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing

Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

Dena Taylor,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending

You're out of my heart

Denai Moore,"Laid my pennies by the lake
Hoping the water could buy me fate
For all of my mistakes
That I have made

Laid out memories by the lake
Hoping that they could sail away
Away from my mind
There's a piece of you left behind

I still see you there, out in the lake
Right in the middle where, it’s all faint
The less I care the more that you’ll fade
I still see you there out in the lake

Laid a letter by the lake
With all the worlds I want to say
And I know they’ll be no reply
But I’d still want you to know why

I still see you there, out in the lake
Right in the middle where, it’s all faint
The less I care the more that you’ll fade
I still see you there out in the lake, lake

You’re sinking down, like a pebble in the lake
Like the ghosts of my past, that's faded away
And now I’m left with nothing but a memory

I still see you there, out in the lake
Right in the middle where, it’s all faint
The less I care the more that you’ll fade
I still see you there out in the lake",The Lake

I once was sleeping
All remains are in safe keeping
Looks like everybody knows
I want to learn the secret my way
It's right behind me
So softly
Centered in a field
Hold to kill
I'm in the same rotation

Why this is the wrong way out

Lock down inside

I never knew this is the way it goes",Everybody Knows

More than a test for old friends

Let's go under and hold our breath

That moment I feel
Instead of wasting time

After sundown after sundown
There's no mistake
Wait for my return and decide my fate
I'll be without you only for a while
That's all I can take
That's all
No more distractions
No more excuse

An apparition, a sensation is no guide
And on my way to see
Something caught my eye
The light inside is on

Take a breath if you come in
Did I invite you in
Most impressions fade
But you're still standing
There is no landing for now
A watchful eye can see right in
Will it be innocence or just a daydream that dies
How did you get so close to being in here
Did I invite you in again",Welcome

Tell me are we sharing the same fantasy?
I'll kiss you, kiss me too

Knocking, knocking, knocking at the door

When love comes calling
Won't you open up for more?

Our light conversation was a part of Cupid's scheme.
One dance in the full moonlight, one touch of a dream.

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Denis d'Aoust,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,

When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream. About me. About you. 
The way our American hearts beat down in the bottom of our chests. 
About the special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts, 
Maybe below the cockles, maybe in the sub-cockle area. 
Maybe in the liver. Maybe in the kidneys. Maybe even in the colon,
We don't know.

I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job
I'm your average white suburbanite slob
I like football and porno and books about war
I've got an average house with a nic hardwood floor
My wife and my job, my kids and my car
My feet on my table, and a Cuban cigar

But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested
(Oh no) No Way (Uh-uh)
No, I've gotta go out and have fun
At someone else's expense
(Oh yeah) Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I drive really slow in the ultrafast lane
While people behind me are going insane

I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, such an asshole)

I use public toilets and piss on the seat
I walk around in the summertime saying, ""How about this heat?""

I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole (He's the world's biggest asshole)

Sometimes I park in handicapped spaces
While handicapped people make handicapped faces

I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole (He's a real fucking asshole)

Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song
Ranting and raving and carrying on
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong

You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac El Dorado convertible, 
Hot pink with whaleskin hub caps and all leather cow interior and big brown
baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah! And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115mph getting one mile per gallon, sucking down quarter pounder cheese burgers from
McDonald's in the old-fashioned non-biodegradable styrofoam containers and when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers, I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the
American flag and then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam container right out the side and there ain't a God damned thing anybody can do about it. YOu know why? Because
we got the bombs, that's why.

Two words. Nuclear fucking weapons, okay?! Russia, Germany, Romania - they can have all the Democracy they want. They can have a big democracy cake-walk
right through the middle of Tiananmen square and it won't make a lick of difference because we've got the bombs, okay?! John Wayne's not dead - he's frozen. And as
soon as we find the cure for cancer we're gonna thaw out the duke and he's gonna be pretty pissed off. You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower? Well
multiple that by 15-million times, that's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be. I'm gonna get the Duke and John Cassavetes...

Denis Leary,"I love to smoke, I smoke seven thousand packs a day, okay?
And I am never fucking quitting I don't care how many laws they make
What's the law now? You can only smoke in your apartment
Under a blanket, with all the lights out? Is that the rule now, huh?

The cops are outside, ""We know you have the cigarettes
Come out of the house with the cigarettes above your head""
""You'll never get me copper! I'm never coming out, you hear?
I got a cigarette machine right here in my bedroom, yeah! Say yeah!""

Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get one of those tracheotomies
So I can smoke two cigarettes at the same time
I'm gonna get nine tracheotomies, all the way around my neck
I'll be tracheotomie man!
""He can smoke a pack at a time! He's tracheotomie man!

I'm looking forward to cancer, man, I want that throat cancer
That's the best kind, you know why?
You get that throat cancer, you get that voice box thing
Know what I'm talking about?

Sure it's scary, but you can make a lot of money with a voice box
Get a voice box, walking around the streets of Manhattan
""You got any spare change?""
""Ahh! Here's my whole wallet, get away from me!""

Imagine a whole family with voice boxes, that'd be creepy, wouldn't it?
They'd be out in that backyard everyday during the summer
""Dad, can we go to the beach?"", ""Yes, get your mother and the dog""
""We'll leave right now, Sparky, come here""

Or the ultimate irony, a guy with a voice box pulling up to the drive
Through window at Mcdonald's, that has to suck, huh?
""Can I help you?"", ""Big Mac and a large order of fries""
""Stop making fun of me"", ""I'm not making fun of you""
""I'm getting the manager"", ""Get the fucking manager, I don't care""

I can remember a time in this country
When men were proud to get cancer, God dammit!
When it was a sign of manhood! John Wayne had cancer twice
Second time, they took out one of his lungs, he said, ""Take 'em both!
'Cuz I don't fuckin' need 'em! I'll grow gills and breathe like a fish!""

Babe Ruth, greatest baseball player to ever play the game
He had a voice box, he was the first American to have a voice box
Yeah!, ""This is Babe Ruth
The Sultan of Swat, the Bambino""

I smoke twenty-five goddamn Black Cuban cigars a day
I had meat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
I fucked eighteen prostitutes a night!
'Course, I'm dead now

I'm up here in Heaven, Lou Gehrig is up Here with me
God love Lou Gehrig, Jesus Christ, poor Lou Gehrig
Died of Lou Gehrig's disease
How the Hell did he not see that coming?

We used to tell him, Lou, there's a disease
With your name all over it, pal!
There ain't no Babe Ruth disease, I'll tell you that much right now
Have a hot dog and a Hummer, go ahead, it's on me""

I don't know, personally, I think Billy Martin said it best when he said
""Hey! I can drive!"", because we tried to be nice to you non-smokers
We fucking tried, okay?
You wanted your own sections in the restaurants, we gave you that

But that wasn't enough for you, then you wanted the airplanes
We gave you the whole God damn plane! You happy now?
You own the fucking plane! I'd like an explanation about that one folks
Because I will guarantee you if the plane is going down
The first announcement you're gonna hear is

""Folks, this is your Captain speaking, look, uhm, light 'em up
'Cause we're going down, okay, I got a carton of Camels non-filters
I'll see you on the ground, take it easy""
Actually, it'd be more like this, ""This is your Captain speaking""
""Smoke 'em if ya got 'em""

The filters the best part, that's where they put the heroine
Only us real good smokers know that fucking secret
Yeah, we tried to be nice to you non-smokers
But you just fucking badger us, you know? You won't leave us alone

You got all your little speeches you're always giving to us
All these little facts that you dig out of a newspaper or pamphlet
And you store that little nugget in your little fucking head
And we light up and you spew 'em out at us, don't ya?
I love these little facts, these little facts

""Well you know, smoking takes ten years off your life""
Well it's the ten worst years, isn't it folks?
It's the ones at the end! It's the wheelchair, dialysis fucking years
You can have those years! We don't want 'em, alright!?

And I guarantee if I'm still alive then I'll be smoking then
I'll be in my wheelchair, with my adult diapers on
And my twenty-five year old non-smoking born again
Christian son behind me

I'll be going, ""Hey! Make sure you wipe this time
I was itching all week for Christ's sake!
And get me some more wippets
I'm almost out, you fucking pussy! Come on!""

Because you're always telling us
""You know, if you quit smoking now
Every cigarette takes three minutes off your life
If you quit now you can live an extra ten years
If you quit now, you can live an extra twenty years""

Hey, I got two words for you, okay, Jim Fix, remember Jim Fix?
The big famous jogging guy? Jogged fifteen miles a day
Did a jogging book, did a jogging video
And dropped out of a heart attack when?
When he was fucking jogging, that's when!

What do you wanna bet it was two smokers
Who found the body the next morning and went
""Hey! That's Jim Fix, isn't it?"" ""Wow, what a fucking tragedy
Come on, lets go buy some buds""

It's always the yogurt sprout eating mother fuckers
Who get run over by a bus drive by a guy
Who smokes three and a half packs a day
""Sorry officer, I didn't see him, I was too busy smoking!""

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Denise DeCaro,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)
Denise DeCaro,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Denise Direnzo,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love
Denise Direnzo,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Denise Perrier,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Denise Perrier,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Denise Perrier,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around
Denise Perrier,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under an August moon burning above

Denise Vasquez,"Another head hangs lowly 
Child is slowly taken 
And if violence causes the silence 
Who are we mistaking 
But you see it's not me 
It's not my family 
In your head in your head 
They are fighting 

With their tanks and their bombs 
And their bombs and their guns 
In your head in your head they are crying

[Chorus]
In your head
In your head
Zombie zombie zombie ei ei 
What's in your head 
In your head.
Zombie, zombie, zombie ei, ei, ei, oh do,do,do,do,do,do,do,do 

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over the violence causes silence 
We must be mistaken 
It's the same old thing since 1916 
In your head in your head 
Their still fighting 
With their tanks and their bombs 
And their bombs and their guns 
In your head in your head they are dying

Denison Marrs,"You say till the end as you hold me close the music starts 
& the dance begins as we sway turn 
& bend promises are made 
& the words you say seem to heal & mend
& I say to myself this must be love

Everytime we meet you become a bigger part of me 
& everytime we leave it tears a hole through the heart 
Of me so go ahead take me in break me down 
& then build me back up again

Denison Witmer," Christmas time,
in the business around that time,
I could not lift my head enought to see
the face that I wanted to see.
Through the door
where the packages lie on the floor,
evergreen and incense in the air,
there was a year i didn't care.
With my voice I sang this before,
that grace would come and sorrow be no more.
With my ears I've heard this before,
that grace would come and sorrow be no more.
With my knees I bend to the floor.
Christmas day,
in the stillness that protects this day,
the string of lights was strung into a tree,
a string of lights was strung inside of me,
I felt at peace and fell asleep.
I felt at peace
and slept.",Christmas Song

Not if I don't want to

Last night spent on the couch
Felt your heartbeat pounding out
Sounds like someone's footsteps on the floor
I dreamt we walked from room to room
Opened doors into those parts of you
All the memories that I have of us before

You never question where they've gone

Tallest buildings
Parents and their kids
And all the things we did
Or wish that we did

You start to glow

With lots of trees and quiet

like a poem about springtime

are lined up so straight
but here on the inside,
it's not that way
i gave you my life and more
from sadness to sunshine,
i'm yours, i'm your lost happiness

that you'll never know

With the pain across my chest

Across so many things

Go out all night with strangers on a Friday
My practiced insecurity
Put prison walls around you
So I know you had to leave

And a sweater on your chest
Desire to be rectified
The footend of your bed replies,
""There's space for you to move""

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

Dennis Coffey,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

Making my entrance again,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Dennis Day,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven

Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,

No other can take it,
No one ever will.

Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

She wasn't sure of all the feelings
Racing through her heart

I looked into her eyes
Knowing something wasn't right
And suddenly the tears began to show
Babe, I know that it's wrong
But you know I'm really not that strong
How I wish I could tell you that I am
But before I even read this letter
I want you to stay,
But if I see your mind's made up
There's one thing I've got to say, whoa

You can call me
Baby if you ever change your mind
Believe me when I say to you
Anytime will be alright
You can call me
Only seven numbers on the phone
Maybe we can talk things over
You're never that far from home
Oh, no, no, baby you're not alone

Another season
Another change
Two hearts are breaking
With no one to blame
I know the reasons
You want to go
But if you find that you still want me
There's one thing that you know

You can call me
Baby if you ever change your mind
Believe me when I say to you
Everything will be alright
You can call me
Only seven numbers on the phone
Baby we can talk it over
You're never that far from home
No, no, no, whoa whoa

Believe me when I say to you

24 hours from you
Counting the headlights, billboards and raindrops
Somehow I'll get through
Crossing the border, no danger can stop me

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love

I still remember that Sunday in Roseland
You came alone to the dance
I acted crazy to try and impress you
What did I know of romance
Two children searching for love and assurance
Each of us afraid in our own way

8 to 5 in the welding shop
Barely finished junior high
Took a job at the tool and die

And if the weld was double tough
Harry had the knack
He's the kind of guy
Who'd give his friends the shirt right off his back

Now Harry doesn't care for booze
Or stock reports in the daily news
He likes baseball on T.V.
He couldn't understand free agency

See he never really wanted much
Just a decent life
Somewhere he could call his own
For his kids and wife

And layoffs were part of life
Like taxes, death and union strikes
But this one lasted much too long
He was certain now there was something wrong

So he went and looked for work in every factory
But they were all now servicing in this new economy
All at once there came a storm
On the ships from foreign shores
Smaller cars and VCR's were here to stay

Harry cried complacency
Can't you see you're killing me
The bottom line ain't all that it's cracked up to be

Harry's heart keeps on beating strong
Born and raised in the promised land

I just need a job to work to save my dignity

Every night I pray to God
Please help me find a job
Untie my hands and let me make my way

Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet

All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp shutters
And soon it will be morning

I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Of my days in the sun

A most amazing man
He had that look
You very rarely find
The haunting hunted kind

I asked him
To say what had happened
How it all began
I asked again
He never said a word
As if he hadn't heard

And next the room was full
Of wild and angry men

They fell on him and then disappeared

She realized she'd left him behind

And though there's nothing left to say
Would she listen if I stay?

No choices whatsoever.

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Cause I may not be around to do the things 
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way 
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

Was common-place for me and you

Seemed to be made just for us two

That I thought was you and I

Cause our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye

And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
If I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Non l'avrei mai detto che a metà di un libro si potesse chiudere
Oggi cosa resta se l'amore non si fa più sulle nuvole?
Chi non muore si ripete, chi non vuole non si vede più
Non mi sono rassegnato affatto come invece hai fatto tu
Chi l'avrebbe messa in giro questa voce, questo cuore debole?
Che non sapeva neanche camminare ma voleva sempre vincere
E si mangiava le unghie della vita e le lanciava sulle nuvole

Yeah, ich stopfe 100 Kilo Knoblauch in mich rein
Einfach nur, damit ich stinke wie ein Schwein
So halt' ich mir die Labernasen auf Distanz
Und habe meine wohlverdiente Ruhe, wenn ich tanz'
Und will ich mal shoppen gehen, ungestört
Schmier' ich mir'n bisschen Kacke meiner Tochter auf mein Shirt
Dann denken sie vielleicht „Der Alte, der hat 'n Schaden“
Doch wenigstens traut mich keiner, mich nach 'nem Foto zu fragen
Ich hab kein Bock

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Denzel Curry,"It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning
Close my eyes and say ""forgive me""
'Cause I know the devil lame
Devil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning
'Cause the world is full of sinning
No your son is not a saint
Spirit of God and the holy ghost it was written in anecdotes
That a snake would try to corrupt what he create
Sick of facades and the horoscope I devour the antidote
Told my mother that I was spirited away
Monstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated
Falling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated
Innocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated
Welcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated
Relying on the last breath, but y'all would never know
Rewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below
If heaven's set on fire that's the day they make hell snow
The devil want my soul and yet I'm telling him ""hell no""
It's still like this...

I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards ever since the new beginning
God has given me the vision so that I can see my fate
Blind can't lead the blind and if we try then we'll be spinning
In a cycle in position trying to find a better place
Lucifer, devil, the anti-Christ taking light up out of my life
In the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape
Initially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot
And then bury it in a spot where I decay
It's death before dishonor I'm a hideous disfigurement
Who's dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians
Came from the Vatican, kill off the advocate
Feeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed
Won't even make it to see 23, yeah, fuck it I don't wanna be
Here, look at the time when I'm turning it back
On the clock and my right hand making it tick
Life is a bitch, better yet it's a pit
And my hatred is everything making you sick
Regurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred
Burn the sages, caught in mazes
Instigated, inspiration, imitations
Only here, reanimated, damn!

Make me feel bad!

I wish I could tear it up
But then again I haven't the guts!
I wish I could throw it on the fire
I wish I could
But to say I would
I'd be a liar!

What good is a colour print
Of a little baby doll?
When just one little glance
Is enough to make me feel dull!

I hoped I would misplace it
But then I take such good care of it
I wish it would disappear
I say I wish
But then I relish
It being here!

Feel blue.

I'll never be the same again
Gonna lock myself in a cold black room
Gonna shadow myself in a veil of gloom

Search and search for hours
In among the flowers

Seen love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places I've looked
It's still no clearer it's just not enough
I'm still no nearer the meaning of love

Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning, the meaning of love?

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
But I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see,
I've never been in love before

Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind
Tell me the answer, my Lord high above
Tell me the meaning, the meaning of love

I'm still no nearer the meaning of love

Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning, the meaning of love?

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well, I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see
I've never been in love before, never been in love before
Never been in love before

Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind
Tell me the answer, my Lord high above
Tell me the meaning, the meaning of love

When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it",Halo

And your body's a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desire's name

Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill

Oh sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it too

In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
You're desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure

With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself it's alright
He'll make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away

Depeche Mode,"Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come
This twisted, tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want?
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do?
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun
Is there something you need from me?
Are you having your fun?
I never agreed to be
Your Holy One
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun

Was always to beauty
That was my crime

Depeche Mode,"She was silent, trying to be like the girl
Who acted on the TV
Always knowing when to say
Wishing for a moment so that they could see

Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think, that she knew her lines

Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand

Carefully watching waiting as
I stood upon the back streets
And we start to play
I was screaming louder as the
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way

Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think, that she knew her lines

Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand

Placing all the questions in the minutes of a game
We won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful the radio transmission
That I have to know

You could never run
You could never stay
And I think you belong to me

Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand

Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand

Carefully watching waiting as

Break away tonight

When the walls come tumbling in

It will be worth it

Bring your chains your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

It may not last forever, but of all wind is blowing.

It's a strange obsession, it's drawing us nearer.
We don't understand it, it never get's clearer.

There's something mystical in our dreams.
They're so simplistic it kicks and screams.

Oh when we see too recon the art occult that nothing can keep us down.

Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone

Depeche Mode,"On another world by another star at another place and time
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,
That you may reach a different verdict,
If all the judges missed the case

In a parallel universe that's happening right now
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how

And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect
Accused, abandoned and disgraced

I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound, i turned my head around
To watch our love shot down

In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide

And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right
There are never any conflicts
There are never any fights",Perfect

Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop

Stealing a god from a Muslim, too

Until you do
Exactly what they want you to

I can see them now Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one

Exactly what they want you to

For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do

Depeche Mode,"To the soul's desires

Depeche Mode,"I know it's hard to reach you
I know it's hard to breathe
I know it's hard to be you sometimes
I can't imagine what that means

This must be someone else's story
I can't follow what you've planned
How could this be about me
Am I supposed to understand?

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me

You're still looking for redemption
Still can't find a trace
If there is nothing after
There 'll be the saving grace

I'm giving you control now
I need some kind of sign
Can't take away the sorrow now
I gave you all that's mine

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you

Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me",All That's Mine

I was there when you wanted me least

And your holy ghost and priest

Through your failures and success
Through your losses and gains
I didn't see much happiness or pain

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't fill that hole
Alone

I saw you at your best
I knew you at your worst
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed

There's a thin grey line
Between the black and white
It's evidently hard to find at night

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't play that role
Alone

Now it's too, too late for
words That should have been said

Depeche Mode,"The well is dry and this
The sun is high and the field might sparrow 
A time and my body aching 
Now I'm opened wide and afraid of breaking

The fire is hot and the tables are ready 
But the stomach nuts make my hands unsteady 
So I take to pace and up and down the room 
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's confused

I just wanna be part of the light
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes
I just wanna be part of the light
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes

The bed is made and the candles burning 
All our and the clock keeps turning 
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting 
And the dagger stick as the doors keep shutting 

I just wanna be part of the fire
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes
I just wanna be part of the fire

Depeche Mode,"The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so small
The legs beneath me weakened
I began to crawl

Confused and contented
I slithered around
Reveal is beyond me
I was lost, I was found

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so weak
I felt my tongue move in my mouth
And I began to speak

A strange kind of language
I don’t understand
A babbling fountain
I couldn’t have planned

Oh leave me here forever more
I found the peace I’ve been searching for

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so high
I swear I could have reached up
Placed my hands upon the sky

A radiant rainbow
Was following me around
With elevated senses
I can see and taste sound

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so clean
Like a preacher on Sunday
My heart was serene

I waded into the water
I was bathed, I was drowned
Like the sinners before me
I knelt down on the ground

Oh leave me here forever more
I found the peace I’ve been searching for

Oh let me sleep forever more
I found the peace I’ve been searching for",Angel

Without any sand
Only you can reach me
Only you’re allowed

Our time without tears?

When you’re falling
I will catch you
You don’t have to fall that far

Depeche Mode,"There is darkness and death in your eyes
What have you got buried inside?
The shallow grave in your soul
The ghosts that have taken control

You really should have dug a little deeper there
Body parts are starting to appear and scare 
The child inside away

Each tear that flows down your face
Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside

I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart

I can see you drifting away
Heading for the light
I can see you drifting away
Every night

Why were you always inside?
On days when the weather was fine
And while we were running around
You were nowhere to be found

You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead
The child inside you died",The Child Inside
Depeche Mode,"It was you that stripped my soul
And threw it in the fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire

Now I'm pure
Now I'm clean
I feel good and serene
In you

There is no denying
How I have been changed
You won't hear me crying
Now misery is strange

I can dream
I can fly
Now it seems I get by
With you

Goodbye, yeah
Goodbye, again

I was always looking
Looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
And pull it out and run

Now I'm caught on your line
All my thoughts are entwined
In you

Goodbye, yeah
Goodbye, again

If you see me walking
Through the golden gates
Then turn around stop talking
Stop and hesitate
I'll be waiting up there
With my fate in the air

Better, Better part of me

From the inside I could feel myself Paralyzed,

Depswa,"You know it wasn't so long ago 
When things weren't as we know 
Back when I was younger and had a hunger 
For all the things I didn't know 

And I remember the day when 
I went out to play 
And I bird flew down to my hand 
Didn't want to leave and 
When I asked to keep 
I remember my dad said 

Yeah son let it go away 
Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
you know it's here to stay 

Since then I've gone through changes 
Since then I've gone through life 
Since then I found me a beautiful woman 
I thought could be my wife 
She said she really loves me 
But she said she couldn't stay 
She said I've got to go my love 
To find things my own way 

So I let her go away 
Hope that she comes back 
Here to me some day 
I let her go away 
And if she comes back 
I know she's here to stay 

There's not always reasons for the things in life 
But it's comforting to know within your mind 
If you love something enough 
And you've done all that you can 
If there's one thing I have known and learned first hand 
Sometimes you have to just let it go away 

Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
You know it's here to stay 

Let it go away 
And if it comes back 
You know it's here to stay

I stumble to a fall

Could send you deeper into the abyss

You need anyone 
To show you yourself from deeper within 
And if only someone could forgive you 
For all that's been done and said 
But maybe it's too late to change 
And nobody cares anymore

They're colors to paint my feelings for you
And I know how that there's no way to show you
Just how much I care

And I feel it, oh, so deep within me
And I know that there's so much left to share
All the times you're away, feels just like eternity
As the moments that we had, had to end

The strokes of the brush
Brings me closer to your touch
Through the hues we?ll find a way to follow
I know we will

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
On this Canvas of our lives that we create
(And our love will last forever)

And I know that always, I saw to try to display
Just how precious that you are to the world
?Cause I know with just a touch, you can show me, oh, so much
That there's more to this life than what we see

The strokes of the brush
Brings me closer to your touch
Through the hues we?ll find a way to follow
I know we will

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
On this Canvas of our lives that we create
(And our love will last forever)

Colors may fade
Turning vibrant to gray
But one things unchanged
The picture is still the same

And through the days and nights the vision lives on forever
And through a masterpiece of love me made together
We've given all we can, I know the world will understand
The picture is of you and me

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever

Depswa,"Sometimes 
Mixed emotions they ramble on inside 
For a false sense of reality

Here in my mind again 
I thought I saw a face in the wake of you 
But now I can't find you anymore

And i have to pretend that you're here for awhile

To stay or finally go

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream 
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
Caught between two angels and a dream 
And I don't know where to go 

That's a vision of a kingdom 
And its twice is black as night 
They're no brighter than the sun 
With growing rays of light

And somewhere in between 
Is the place that I ignore 
My decision last and win 
And to where I want to go

One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
Caught between two angels and a dream 
And I don't know where to go

Find the answers 
I've got to find 
My equilibrium 
I've got to dream 
Within the balance
I've got to keep 
My equilibrium 

Between the black and white 
Between what's wrong and what's right 
It's where I feel myself fall upon 
Between you and me 
Between what's cash and what's free 
And I found where I belong

I'm overcome with pleasure 
So deep in fantasy

And I see you alone sometimes 
And you begin to cry 
And My heart splits wide open

And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade
And the pavements were steaming

I needed time for some thinking
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye
And I swore it was winkin'

She was thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring

The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown
And I thought it would melt her

She threw back her hair like I wasn't there
And she sipped on a Julep
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare
When I looked at her two lips

And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say 
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the boy in you away

And then she smiled and we talked for a while
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand 
But I saw the sunrise as a man

Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers
I go back in my mind to the very first time
And feel the touch of her fingers",Summer (The First Time)

Derek Minor,"I was nine years old when daddy first touched me
At 15 I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in 'cuz I was pretty though
He said that you could make some money in my video
I get high and drunk just to make it through a show
And act like I'm enjoying it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know and I really hate it
Mr. Minor are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
And got computer programs to block me from your vision
And every time you watch me you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preaching about how not to let me catch you slipping
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray maybe I might get a mention (please)
Before you talk about me remember that I'm lost
And your secret pleasure coming at a cost

Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen

Man I'm on that chronic
Higher than a comet
Sippin' gin and tonic
Drinking till I vomit
Tatted on my arms, tatted on my face
Pants hanging low, nina on my waist
I be slanging soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs but never for these girls
It's M.O.E. 'cuz money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy
Saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me
Felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressing bummy
Went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus they used to jump me
God I just prayed to you Sunday
Now it's Monday, I'm starving
Sip sour milk out of the carton
Talk to myself while I'm out walking should I put myself in a coffin?
I don't know! All I grew up with was trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning

And daddy told me I was nothing but a problem

I don't need to be judged by you and all of your wack friends
Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?
Where I'm from we don't pretend
We know we ain't gettin' in
Now the world don't trust me
And these streets done crushed me
Thought you were known for love but you just love to judge me
Truth is, ironically you need me around though
'Cuz otherwise you got nobody else to look down on

Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen

Derek Minor,"Welcome to Minorville
Where the bigger the better
Where the flashier the greater
My world's not based on who I am
But what I have

I came up from the bottom
Said hello to Satan
Before I crack through the earth's crust
(What, all they do)
Post up, drink good, and smoke blunts
When I was coming up
They were clapping at ya'll
But nowadays the chopper's givin' applause
See, if the love of money is the root of evil
It's no wonder this culture brainwashing our people
Hey, why else would college graduates parade around as dope boys?
Dumb their whole life down, Oh boy
He got a bad dime piece tho
While she gon' bare it all for a tv show.
Networks making tons of dough
We out here looking like CB4
I feel like you must of missed it
Put your whole society around riches
While kids in Africa put water on they wishlist,
We buy a couple more Benz's

When you could have it all

Flippin' through a hundred channels, it ain't nuthin' on.
Then I heard this preacher say he praying for my soul
But, if I really want the blessings of the Lord to shine
I need to buy this magic oil for $9.99
So if I put this chicken grease on my fo-head(forehead)
And spin in five circles like you said
You're telling me that mama have no debt
Even though my credit bad and I ain't even got a job yet!
I smell a crook here in the castle, I ain't talking fashion.
To sell hope to broke folk promise 'em all a mansion
To turn God into a genie
And you Aladdin
Makin a fool out of the church while the world laughin'
See you ain't gotta be a Christian to notice this hope's fishy
When the church is like casinos with slot machines missing
Your congregation put food on they wish list
I see you buyin' more Benz's

It's just to get dough
And I say ""Just cause my family matters
I can't have my Wins low""
Our Father who are in Heaven who bless this flow
I wanna Stellar, but I'll settle for a Grammy tho.
I want to be a movie star at least give me a cameo
Overlooking all the Lord's done before
Hey, I got everything
My wife a fly dame
Bunch of twitter followers will
Gas me up like octane
I get love in the south
A lot of artists say you're hot man
Plus, the lord saved me
It's supposed to be 'bout his fame
I know people are losing business
Jock me from my position
While I steadily look at heaven
Beggin' for somethin' different
The Father gave me everything on my wish list
And now I'm dreamin' bout Benz's

OK now I’m off in this studio
Puttin’ finishin’ touches on all these songs
I’ll probably shoot a video
Unless of course my album budget is all gone
I turn it in to my label, everybody like who
All these fans say that they love it, bought two copies off of Itunes
Then I get a mention on my timeline, with some random blogger review
Said the whole album is garbage, he hate everything that I do
Well what I ain’t know is he insecure, 'cause he used to rap himself 'till,
Life smashed his dreams, now he crush everyone else

Now what get off of these boats is pounds of coke

High schools got armed guards ‘cause teenagers bear arms
And they'll crack your head and put that video on World Star
That boy you callin' a nerd got a bomb off in his backpack
Plan to get revenge and leave a crater where his class at
I saw the sickest thing when Channel 4 News was on
A momma put a two-year-old inside a stove
We look at third worlds and turn up our nose

The devil eatin' the hood, I think America's for dessert
The suburbs love rappers, just come to one of our shows
You'll see Tabitha and Matthew repeating all our flows
While you think she tryna get that tat, but think you wearin' a snapback

I lift this country to the Lord and in Jesus' name I pray
That the gospel rip our heart, and we turn from wicked ways
I know you gave us this country and they takin' it to date
So listen to me, politician: I'm not talking superstition
It's the fight and the survival of a nation, and we gon' need way more than religion
In a tragedy we run to he who gives us hope and then we get up fixedly
But I pray that we forever let America submit to the King so one day we'll be

Derek Minor,"There's a place where life is everything you dreamed it would be.
There are no problems, or conflict.
And you're always right
Even when you're wrong.
Racism, and class-ism, don't exist.
And birds never poop on your car
Even after you've washed it.
Yes, I know this place,
It's called
Minorville

I woke up in a new Bugatti,
(Turn up!)
Or Honda Accord
I can't tell the difference.
And everybody loved all my opinions,
I did everything right,
Cause that's what it means to be Christian.
Drove 60 in a 45,
The cops ain't even trip.
Guess Obama just cleared my Illuminati membership.
Got mistaken for a doctor,
Instead of a ball player.
And the Pistons drafted Carmelo,
We winnin' it all playa!
No political parties,
The government's fair, right.
It's ILLEGAL for father's not to be in they kids life.
Marriage is a habit,
Women are not objectified.
And rappers tell the TRUTH in they songs instead of lies.
This is a place where there's no black or white churches,
Color could NEVER divide us,
We love each other perfect.
I hope you find what you lookin' for in our city now,
Hey this is Minorville,
Come and take a look around!

Since I picked up this pen and told you I'm glad you're mine
Forever together, nothing can separate us too
And if love is scary, baby you my Boo
First time I saw you my homies said I was crazy
My mind is an art gallery, pictured you with my baby
I took your hand as we walked through the sunshine, lady
Said ""get from under that tree, them other dudes are shady""
See I was broke, didn't care about my profit
So that sealed the deal, I looked for rings like signing
You held me down in this love, I swear that I ain't forgot
You deserve diamonds on your finger the size of Ring Pops
And when my shoe was untied, they said the boy was trippin'
She looked past it all, straight patient with him
You a thief girl, you stole my heart
I ain't goin' nowhere till death do us part

See we in love that's strong, what it mean
She independent, but don't mind still calling me king
They say it's old school for you to be my only queen
Well if we primitive, you fly as Pterodactyl wings
Uh, I know I do some things you don't prefer
I'm a chiropractor, get all on your nerves
We get in arguments, sometimes we say some hurtful words
But through that, we see the way that Christ loved the church
I'll protect you girl, your man's loyal
And Lord have mercy on anyone who put they hands on you
We one, and when they hurtin' you they hurtin' me
Never wanna see you cry to me, that's an emergency

Derek Minor,"I just want to get these dreams out,
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

15 years old
Sitting in my bedroom
Watching my baby sister
And praying Mom's will be home soon
Burning my arms
The pressure hit me like typhoons
'Cause I'm the only black kid in my homeroom
I felt the power of words that day
When I was called coon
Sharp as any sword
When they cut, it scar you
You know the pain when people seem to ignore you
I grab the teacher like ""I just want to be heard!""
I went home, and put it all inside a notebook
Poetry is molding me
Look, this how hope look
My father is in Michigan
My step-dad addicted and
My mom's out at working all her fingers to the bone
And I feel like I'm worthless and hurting beneath the surface
It's clear that I am broken Lord,
I just need you in my home
And that day
A dream was born
That in 16 bars
You can hear my pain in this song.

I just want to get these dreams out,
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

I see some doctors and lawyers
With a person to cure cancer
And they don't even know it
It's a voice in they dreams, it drowned out
By the loudmouths
Dreamkillers screaming for God to quiet down
So if they say that you are nothin'
Tell em' thank you
'Cause God created this whole universe, that is proof
Meaning, we're expressions of the greatest artist
Brushstrokes of The King's speech, greatest masterpiece
So why you let em' take your purpose? (Huh?)
(It's the dream that he gave you)
Why you believin' that you worthless? (Huh?)
(It's a reason why he made you)
Fly higher, inspire,
You were wired to be The Lord's greatness
Naysayers are liars
And this what He designed me to do
I'm living my dream
You better live yours too.

I just want to get these dreams out,
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

Derek Minor,"Who are the fighters,
The conquerors, survivors?
Who is victorious,
In the glorious King of Kings?
You've gotta know we are.
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
Ooh yeah!

I dedicate this to everyone with 116 tatted on their arm
If it ain't inked in your flesh I know it's stitched in your heart
I see an army right in front of me
Black, white and Hispanic, imagine
It's all happened from rapping
Picture that! How God uses foolish things
Like ex-weedheads and d-boys
To speak on His behalf
Can't tell me this ain't the Lord!
We are firm because I see Satan on
A mission for our soul
But Christ told me eat
I see food like Pappadeaux
Crae' doing fine
Tho' people hoping that he stumble'
Hard to get kicked off a mountain
When you fightin' to stay humble
Trip plantin' churches
T-Dot spittin' across the country,
KB going on missions, and Andy shapin' the culture
Now, some might say I'm braggin', but I'm
Just telling you what I see
They won't say about themselves so let me speak!
See, none of us is perfect and we know
But the devil uses that to have us at each others throat
So, for the people who disagree
Or anyone we hurt
Just know our passion's for the body
It's the church!
And tho' we all in different lanes
The focus still the same
Show the world there's freedom in Jesus name

This ain't a rap thing

I have brothers and sisters
All behind my back whenever I flow
Don't want to rap no more
I rather let they stories unfold
If you don't mind
I'll like to let you hear some things that they wrote
See how Nathan had leukemia in 2004
Mike's motorcycle crashed and almost everything broke
Brenda had addictions that she fought with her soul
My prayers are the blood of Christ
Keep making them whole
So, for the girl who like to cut herself
I'm hoping you know
That God ain't forgot you
Your pain's what he want
Meaning your overcome is through Alpha, Omega,
And one day I know that this will be all behind us
Trying already to get my crown ready
Hope's the term regardless of what the world tell me
If you believe I hope The Lord keep your faith steady
I know my champions will rise even though the weight's heavy

His love could save us all, hasn't changed, you ain't never seen Him

You couldn't top that, with a top hat, on the top shelf with a ladder
That you climbed on, just to get there
He's the most high, hands in the air

King of all, watching all his enemies fall
Omnipotence is infinite so witness it like kingdom hall
I bet you think you're a God, not at all
You make it rain, He makes it fall, in galaxies that you never saw
And that's royalty and that crown of thorns is worth more than gold
And that's loyalty and He bought us back when we sold our souls
And I'm mourning me cause the king ordered my death
So I put that royal sword in me and I mortified my flesh, turn up
Thank God for the murder, thank God for the purpose
Think I saw Shadrach and Meshach back in the furnace
Thank God we didn't burn up

The Lord teachin' me patience, feelin' like I'm back in college
I'm learnin' most my issues have to do with economics
But my anger makin' me wanna go and do trigonomics, true
I'm just tellin' y'all where I'm at
Tellin' y'all that I need grace
And I'm still leanin' on that
[?] worried 'bout me that's my dog
He think I'm probably gon' snap
Now I'm talkin' to God a whole lot lately
I'm findin' comfort in that
I'm findin' comfort in that
You said, ""Don't you worry 'bout none of this
[?] none of this
Your work cannot come up with all of this on you
And ain't no way you won't become in this
My empire will never run out of nothin'
Cuz I am the one who is fundin' this
Just do what I told you to do
Give it all that you got and you risin' above in this""

And now You've given us a new beginnin'
You placed us high above
And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down
This is our empire, empire
This is our empire, empire

And where we goin' we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
They said that we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me

And now You've given us a new beginnin'
You placed us high above
And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down

Derek Minor,"I've soared with the angels
Wish I was flyin' with them right now
Feel like I fell right out of heaven
And gravity wanna bring me down, yea

My failures feel so enormous
But they bend in comparison to You
Lord You, Lord You, Lord
And I can hear you sayin'

Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to

Fly, I know the wind is gettin' crazy now
But don't let turbulence take your desire
You see I'm pointing at you from the ground
Sometimes you need that lift to take you higher
You, you, you were made with dreams
You only see, you've flown away (a-ay-a-ay-a-ay, a-ay-a-ay)

My failures feel so enormous
But they bend in comparison to You
Lord You, Lord You, Lord
And I can hear you sayin'

Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to
Fly, fly

I thank the Lord that I'm in His good graces
All I know is that I'm free and this feeling's so amazing
Everything I've been through, bringing me close to You
The fact that I'm here is proof
What am I without you, without you, you

Another eagle with these wings that I've broken
That was made for something greater, and doesn't even notice
Who wasn't on the ground, but should be higher than the wind
Don't be scared of your purpose if you really wanna live
You better fly (fly, fly, fly)

Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight

Fix your eyes to the sky

Fly, fly

Derek Minor,"You wonderin', how big a empire is he gon' make?
Just got off a major tour, bet everybody knows his name
Yeah that boy eatin' better, stackin' chips, that's Frito-Lay
You not with Reach no more, so 116 is he okay?
That's the question that they ask me
I shake they hand and smile and say, ""Everything is dandy""
But deep inside sometimes I wish them conversations passed me
And debates about who better, you, Lecrae, or Andy?
Signed this deal, I bet that we can change your life today
I'm no little mermaid, I won't let you take my voice away
Derek Minor, I'm a Tesla, you can't gas me man
They promise you the world but don't deliver like it's Sunday

All that I know, all that I know
Not gainin' the world or losin' my soul, losin' my soul
When I wanna give up, He tellin' me go, tellin' me go
Buildin' His Kingdom will never get old, never get old",Intro
Derek Minor,"I build your empire
So may my kingdom come
'Till kingdom come 
'Till kingdom come 

Now we got gold teeth in our moutheses
And divas on our coucheses
And no less than bout fifty goons every time I'm out the set
They post up on the corner selling crack to your mammie
And if you come up short then boy I might just pop, pop, pop your grannie
Nothing matters but this cheddar mula I'm a shooter
Hit the plug and sell the work call the jeweler cop a mueller
The Streets my kingdom I'm the ruler
Yeah I'm the ruler
Every fiend they worship me
Bow down when you talk to me
I wanna a girl who got no self esteem that I control her
Once so money hungry if I pay her she do what I want
Ok I have them both
That's what you do when your a boss and you got plenty dough
Boy I got plenty dough
I'm riding in a car that's worth more than your life
Speeding through your city

Oh my God
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you ok?
Somebody call an ambulance

Now have you ever been this high before
Only astronauts can breathe on top of highest floor
That's why they say its astronomical what I afford
If gravity doesn't take your breath, look at my awards
Whose name is on the door
I can take you to Egypt the grass is greener and always sunny
Just put your 401k in my pyramids of money
Now wheres my cappuccino that's why I hired you
Five years ago there's no complaints said I inspired you
This salary pays Sallie Mae wife even admired you
Your kids should thank me I'm the reason their in private school
This ladder had to make you tired
You hope it'll take you higher
But today I change your life
I take that money (You're fired)
I pay that dummy
Go to Vegas that's my craps money
Haha that's funny
Imma sleep good tonight feels so good to have money
I build my own empire you can't take that from me
I'm a king
And its quitting time
I walk outside like the world is mine
And I rule everything I see
Nothing out is stopping me
I put that on my life
I put that on my life",Kingdom Come
Derek Minor,"I want this moment for a lifetime,
I mean a lifetime
You give it all til nothing's left
and that's the right time
I been buildin' this foundation for a minute
You ain't gotta be optometrist for you to see my vision
I'm a voice for the voiceless
Like that D boy buildin' his kingdom, brick after brick
That's feelin' that God done lost him and thinking he got no options
Don't know what that life will cost him.
I swear that's some of my family y'all
And you know that I do this for y'all
So you see God the only reason I made it at all
I sit down and hear your heart, like a stethoscope
Then I get up on this mic and tell it for the world to know
Unless the Lord buildin' it, I can guarantee it's broke
That's why I be spittin' with all this passion when you hear my flow

Now I can tell you 'about my new home
Brand new car that's on chrome
But two years later that's old, everybody's moved on
Gone, I'm tryna make it count with this song
Yeah, with this song

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

It's crazy how times change
Tryna redecorate my life, switched the pictures in my mind frames
Went from hidin' to seekin', trying' to find faith
Now we speak with our feet and our hands, call it sign lang
You age, we get older turn pages
Corners folded, tryna hold on to our place in this maze
See we gave, years of grown' fast pace it's clear to know
Want a direction we would go and that's what we call His grace
And we're still here
No more letters in them bottles, message still clear
Lived our lives for a throttle, tryna fail fair
Ever our foods flash MacDonald's, slow it down
Change up the pitch somethin' like vibrato
But eventually we find this
If you mention all the times that you acted wild and mindless
Rewind it, that's simply just a line that
Minus sign, it change the sum of our lives
Man, this victor is timeless

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

I wanna leave somethin' important on this Earth before I die
So many watches I done purchased, but I still ain't buyin' time
You see doubt is like a brain tumor, it torture those alive
So I'm askin' God to please remove this evil from my mind, yeah
I wanna live without these chains on me
So much dirt, I wanna live without these stains on me
Lord I need Your grace on me
God I live to see Your face only
And by faith only, You know that I want this to last forever

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever",Last Forever
Derek Minor,"Now I've been waiting for a long, I mean waiting for a long time
For a new day to come, a new sun to shine 'cuz so far it's cold nights
They always saying it's the wrong time, why you saying it's the wrong time?
To say bye bye to rain and hello to change I'm ready for the summer time

Sorta like [?] I want a new season good times, bad times feelings uneven
Staring out a window day-dreaming, matter of fact I'm leaving, headed for the ocean

Ocean waves, come and take me away
Ocean please, pull me farther to sea
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin

I'm going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, you had to see that coming
The son of man said he would carry all my burdens and that's the truth and I ain't worrying 'bout nothing
And you know I packed all my bags now, leaving worries behind now
Headed to life, there's no room on this ride now
I'm alive now and all I've got is your love on my mind now

I can feel it in my soul that it's a new season I need it
I could give ya 99 reasons

I'm leaving, I'm leaving

If I hit your mama with an elbow then I'm sorry fam
Ya'll better know it
Misfits and Minor are lions and tigers
In other words, animals, animals, animals
We all going crazy I think you should try now (you, you, you)
Hands to the sky like I'm flapping the Giant
Controlling the crowd like ventriloquist
Many resurrecting if you not feeling this

We gon Party All Night
You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night!

Still rocking Hammer pants
I could do that Hammer dance
Just gimme room though
I'm singing this Spanish
Girls they think I'm in Menudo
I'm drinking Martin in the back and my shirt is mustard
Politicking on the patio my shirt up button

We too busy having fun and you busy doing nothing

Lose Your Mind
We gon Party All Night
You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night!

What the problem is y'all try to play us like Optimus
When we currently in our prime like Optimus
Promoters hit the email like lock us in
We're booked to next year that's a lot of gigs
And a couple of them with Derek and his rapper friends
Canon, B-Coop and not to mention them
But not many other artists that I recommend
Lately I been thinking it was dirty for the culture
Chilling me and stash money dancing in the corner
Twerking out work it out baby feeding over donor
Instagram fill got you feeling like a baller
I do things more stiffer than most you
My raps like a slam dunk tryna post you
Verse like this make this like you supposed to do
Now party all night like we told you to

Derek Minor,"Aye you've been with me from day one
You make everything better girl you A1
Tryna spend my whole life with same one
I mean spend my whole life till I ain't none
Lately I've been out here makin' these moves
But all that I got is nothing without you
You the best tell Cali that I said so
Had to make you mine when I seen you from the get-go
You know that I’m in trouble if I ever lose ya
So I'm out here cuffin' like a state trooper
And we can do whatever you like it don’t bother me
Long as you on my arm like an IV
I’m sick without ya

What’s a castle without you in it
It ain't nothin', no, it ain't nothin'
And it don’t feel right if you missin'
I need your lovin', all your lovin'
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side

Too broke for the horse and carriage
But you've been so down for the kid I proposed a marriage
Old boy, G card, I done turned that in though
Said ""H.I."" to permanent, don’t want no rental
Baby, girl why you so loyal
Only secret's victorian, never change up your story
I never need to record my feelings, I vindicate
You trippin' on me hard
Somehow you done did it, you came before the squad
You vote for me, I vote for you too though
I choose to curb the ones that ain't you though
I caught them feelings I used to just stuck on
Without you here buildin' this empire's nothin'

I need you by my side

Derek Minor,"I ain't got no metaphors, no similes
To explain to y'all what I've been through
Just real talk, just real me
You can see the scars I've lived through
I heard it through the grape vine
They say I'm done like cooked food
But that body's still in the oven
No clue what the chef is up to, yeah

All I know is they said that my pops O.D.'d
He ain't had no insurance
So that burden of buryin' fallen on me
God I need some endurance
I feel like You up in the sky and You torturin' me
Even though that that's foolish
You see all the pain that I feel like You pour it on me
I just hope I don't lose it
Cause I'm tired of buryin' my relatives
Tired of feelin' I'm failin' at everything
Cause sometimes it feel like You take away everything
It feel like You've gotta be mad at me
Are You mad at me? Do You hate me?
Are these tribulations just to break me?
Man, this can't be the reason You made me
I'm goin' crazy, won't You save me?

I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes
You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground

It's like everything around me is crumbling
I feel like I'm losing my mind
Where are You God? Where are You?

The devil is whisperin' up in my head
End it all, end it all, yeah end it all
He's sayin' the Lord He don't want me to win
Not at all, not at all, not at all

See in one whole year
Lost my sister, lost my aunt, lost my dad
Wife got in a wreck, fractured her spine
Feel like evil is circlin' all that I have
Some people mishandle my business
It won't happen again
That money entrusted was took from me
Blew my support and lost one of my friends
I could care less about all of this music
These numbers, opinions, and all of this fame
Just wanna be who God called me to be
And take care of [?] all in the same
I bend on my knees with these tears in my eyes
And my hands to the sky, I'm prayin' for change
Put me in fire, take all that I have
To the end of my days I'm not cursin' Your name
You're all that I have and You gave up Your Son
That is enough
It's all in Your hands and this weight is too much
I have faith in Your love
So as long as I'm alive, long as I'm alive
I'll trust You forever, forever
My faith will never die, faith will never die
For worse or for better
I know You can save me

I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes
You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground

I need You now, I need You now
To just save me, save me

Lookin' for the proof, they should come up with a name of 'em lookin' like they coming for the kill on the mic
Yikes, sniper tracks in tongue of these artists, such a pro I'm cunning these hoarders
I'm havin' 'em thinkin' they ill, till' the cab that I put 'em on, vocal I'm just gettin' started
We go zero to a hundred in that lane, comin' and runnin' and gunnin' what I gain
I pop pop, I'm a semi-automatic, get naked for the server, coming to cut 'em with them lyrics
Been cliqued up, my clique get busted, yeah they shook harder They fallin' like a piñata, like super-sweet
I'm exposin' 'em, lookin' inside of 'em, show 'em that nothin' gon' last but the truth in me
Now friend and enemy done dropped to their knees, hail to the Son of God, he drop drop to the King
King, nothing impossible, look at that Paul the apostle that carried the dream
Dream like Martin the King, make head to the man of the legend, who he?
God is the Alpha Omega, Beginning and End, and the Lamb and the Shepherd of Sheep

Derek Sherinian,"I now will tell you all a story
That no one ever heard before
It is the tale about the fury
Remember wisdom is your strength

It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury
By the fury, no!

At first it came to me in visions
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire
To let the demon burn my soul

It said ""Don't fight in vain,""
""I'll make you love the pain.""

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand

Enslaved forever by the fury
By the fury, no!

I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate

Oh, no it's here again
This demon loves the pain

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury

Derek Sholl,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon

Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true

Derek Smith,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
