Neil Young,"There's a place called Downtown
Where the hippies all go
And they dance the charleston
And they do the limbo
Yeah the hippies all go there
'Cause they want to be seen
It's like a room full of pictures
It's like a psychedelic dream

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown at night
Downtown
Let's have a party
Downtown at night

Yeah it's right around the corner
Up and down the hill
When you hear the band playin'
It's gonna give you a chill
Give your money to the gateman
Young blood in his eye
Hold on to your baby
When you slip into the sky

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown tonight
Downtown
Hear the band playin'
Downtown all right

Jimi's playin' in the back room
Led Zeppelin on stage
There's a mirror ball twirlin'
And a note from Page
Like a water-washed diamond
In a river of sin
Goin' down like a whirlpool
When you get sucked in

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown tonight
Downtown
Hear the band playin'
Downtown all right

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown tonight
Downtown
Let's have a party
Downtown all right",Downtown
Neil Young,"Fallen angel
Who's your savior tonight
You're surrounded by these walls and neon lights
Hungry people move like waves behind the beat
Where's the big drum
Where's the feel of body heat
Where's the big drum
Where's the feel of body heat",Fallen Angel
Neil Young,"I'm an accident
I was driving way too fast
Couldn't stop though
So I let the moment last
I'm for rollin'
I'm for tossin' in my sleep
It's not guilt though
It's not the company I keep

People my age
They don't do the things I do
They go somehwere
While I run away with you
I got my friends
And I got my children too
I got her love
She's got my love too

I can't hear you
But I feel the things you say
I can't see you
But I see what's in my way
Now I'm floatin'
Cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken
Seem to leave a hollow sound

On the long plain
See the rider in the night
See the chieftain
See the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them
When they take another life
Who will hold them
When they tremble for the knife

Voicemail numbers
On an old computer screen
Rows of lovers
Parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens
Echoing across the bay
To the old boats
From the city far away

Homeless heroes
Walk the streets of their hometown
Rows of zeros
On a field that's turning brown
They play baseball
They play football under lights
They play card games
And we watch them every night

Need distraction
Need romance and candlelight
Need random violence
Need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence
Want the testimony of
Expert witnesses
On the brutal crimes of love

I was too tired
To see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain
Fell into bed alone
Started dreaming
Saw the rider once again
In the doorway
Where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him

I'm not present
I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an aerostar
I'm a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane
Trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean
I'm the giant undertow

I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean
I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean
I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean",I'm the Ocean
Neil Young,"Peace and love
Flying so high
Peace and love
Too young to die
Peace and love
Now you decide
Stay for the children
You don't really want to go
Can't feel it pulling like you did
Peace and love

Peace and love
Only a ride
Strength is gone
Dying inside
Tell me now
What did you find
Found love in the people
Livin' in a sacred land
Found love in the people
Peace and love

Found love (found love)
Saw my mistake
Broke walls of pain to walk again
I saw the dream
I saw the wake
We shared it all
But not the take

Peace and love
Lennon's goodbye
Over Now
Living in time
A broken bell
A nursery rhyme
Deserted by heroes
Strangers in your own land
No way to deny you
No way to deny you
Peace and love

I took it all
I took the oath
I took it all
'Til I had most
I took what's left
I gave it breath
I had it all once
I gave it back",Peace and Love
Neil Young,"Looking at the grave
At the scenery around you
Home of the brave
Sometimes they leave you like they found you
Sometimes they worship you
Sometimes they tear your houses down
Sometimes they comfort you
Sometimes they spread your life around

Nothing you can see
That they won't try to give you
Land of the free
Where the legend will outlive you
When you earn their trust
When you are truly in danger
Where greed and lust
Have never been a stranger

Home of the brave
That's where heroes need protection
Media images slaves
Live by random selection
You sell your heart
But that's not the price of freedom
Where things are useful
Only when you need them

Where will you go
When you need to make some changes
Who will you love
In a world of constant strangers
I'll go with you
If you want to take a hero home
I'll stay behind
If you want to take a hero home

Looking at the grave
At the scenery around you
Home of the brave
Sometimes they leave you like they found you

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Home of the brave",Scenery
Neil Young,"Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

Where life's a joy for girls and boys
And only will get better

Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

Romeo and Juliet
The doctor and his case
Without a plan they left the van
And there were laid to waste

Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

The priest was there with sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied

Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never


He held her hand and wished her well
Although his heart was aching
The cameras rolled
The print was bold
The holy war was breaking
It's hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy for girls and boys
And only will get better

Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

The priest was there with sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied",Song X
Neil Young,"Here in the conscious world
We place our theories down
Why man must bring us to our knees
Before he sees the weakness of his sinful plan
The power in his hand
Will never touch a friend

Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down

Meanwhile in the underworld
The weaknesses are seen
By peasants and presidents
Who plan the counter-scheme
Children in the schoolyard
Finish choosing teams
Divided by their dreams
While a TV screams

Throw your weapons down
Throw your weapons down

The wheel of fortune
Keeps on rollin' down
The street that's paved with sinful plans
There but for circumstance
May go you or I
Dressed in gold lame
Find a place to stay

Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down
Throw your weapons down",Throw Your Hatred Down
Neil Young,"Saw your friend
Working in this hotel
Says he used to know you when
And your dreams

Lucky as they seemed
They all
Turned their back on him
Truth be known

Truth be known
Way I feel tonight
Living in
This back street town

'Bout my dreams
They all seem to fade
As soon as
I put my money down
Truth be known

When the fire
That once was your friend
Burns your fingers to the bone
And your song

Meets a sudden end
Echoing
Through right and wrong
Truth be known
Truth be known",Truth Be Known
Neil Young,"Can't forget what happened yesterday
Though my friends say don't look back
I can feel it coming through me
Like an echo
Like a photograph",What Happened Yesterday
Neil Young,"She lives in the TV sky
She lives in such pain
She rides in a bulletproof
Stretch limousine
The smoke in the barroom nights
The faces in the window
The sound of the harbor horn
She recognized

And when the music started
She just slipped away
Just like a river rollin' down
And when the music started
She just slipped away

High on a windy hill
The turbine did whine
Low in the valley chill
A baby was cryin'
Impossible to take the time
The moment is here
Cry out from behind the pines
A voice comin' near

And when the music started
She just slipped away
Just like a river rollin' down
And when the music started
She just slipped away",Slip Away
Neil Young,"We're changing highways
In heavy traffic
See the lights turn
To something graphic
With my suitcase and my brew
I come in your room

Hello hello
Is that you stranger
Is this our music
Up in you manger?
And is this your exit too?
We're changing highways",Changing Highways
Neil Young,"I built a house of cards
Built a house of rain
Built a house of love
It's hard to build again
Built a road to reason
Built a road to fate
Built a road to the promised land
Right up to the gate

Loose change in my pocket
Future in my hand
Too many distractions
For me to understand

Too many distractions
Got to get back home
Get into something solid
Get out of the zone
Some roads bring renewal
Some roads hide and wait
Some roads promise everything
And steal your fuel away

Loose change in my pocket
Future in my hand
Too many distractions
For me to understand

Some roads I been flyin'
Some roads I crashed
Some roads I been sleepin' on
Some roads I got back

Some roads I been runnin'
Some roads I was stopped
Some roads I been walkin down
Some roads I was lost",Loose Change
Neil Young,"Have you ever been lost
Have you ever been found out
Have you ever felt all alone
At the end of the day
Yeah I'm talkin' bout gettin' down
Take it easy - there's no one around
Just a mirror and you and me
And the TV sky

I was walkin down main street
Not the sidewalk but main street
Dodgin' traffic with flyin' feet
That's how good I felt
Took a spin in the laundromat
Played a game in the music arcade
Kept winnin' while the band played
That's how good I felt

(chorus)

Have you ever been singled out
By a hungry man
You're listening to the radio
He's washin' your window
When you look in those vacant eyes
How does it harmonize
With the things that you do?
That's how good I felt

(chorus)

There's a comet in the sky tonight
Makes me feel like I'm alright
I'm movin' prety fast
For my size
I really didn' mean to stay
As long as I have
So I'll be movin' on",Music Arcade
Neil Young,"I'm not asleep when I'm lyin' down
I'm asleep when I' walkin' around
This town
This town

Some people think that it's not OK
To sleep around and kiss the hours away
This town
It's OK",This Town
Neil Young,"Someone and someone
Were down by the pond
Looking for something
To plant in the lawn
Out in the fields 
They were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping
This water will boil
When I look through the windows
And out on the road
They're bringing me presents
And saying hello

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

If I was a junkman
Selling you cars
Washing your windows
And shining your stars
Thinking your mind
Was my own in a dream
What would you wonder
And how would it seem?
Living in castles
A bit at a time
The king started laughing
And talking in rhyme

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age",Words
Neil Young,"My old dad went a walkin' one day,
Pushing tall weeds right outta his way,
My old dad went a walkin' one day,
Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt,
Daddy went a walkin'  just to feel the earth,
Got a little dirty but that's all right,
Hey now, hey now

Old man crossing the road,
You've got to let him go,
Old man crossing the road,
He's feelin' fine

Daddy went a ridin' in his old car,
Took the dog with him 'cause it ain't too far,
Daddy went ridin' in his old car,
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots and an old straw hat,
Daddy's getting wood with the barnyard cat,
Got a little dirty but that's all right,
Hey now, hey now

Old man crossing the road,
You've got to let him go,
Old man crossing the road,
He's feelin' fine

Mama's waiting
At the top of the hill,
They'll be laughing,
Oh the stories they'll tell...
When he holds her
In his arms again,
They'll be sweethearts
With time on their hands

Neil Young,"The flash from a distant camera
Reconnecting thoughts and actions
Fragments of our missing dream
Pieces from here and there
Fall in place along the line
Disappearing between you and me

Life is changing everywhere I go
New things and old both disappear
If life is a photograph fading in the mirror
All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you.

On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones that missed their chances
When they couldn't let it show
Lies the land of sweet surrender
Like a dream it might have ended there
But we didn't even know

Now forever we will live as one,
Floating in love's atmosphere
If love is a piece of dust shining in the sun,
All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing to you
All I need is this song for love
To sing for you

Song of love
Song of love",Distant Camera
Neil Young,"In the canyons of the great divide
Familiar places that we can run and hide
Are filled with strangers
Walking in our houses alone

In the great divide
Nothing to decide
No one else to care for or love
In the great divide
You won't fit in too well

On the horses of the carousel
She rides alone with you and me
She rides like she knows
Wherever she goes, we'll be there

On the carousel
Life is going well
Anyone can tell we're in love
On the carousel
You're gonna like the way you feel

You and I, we got caught down there
In the twisted canyons of the great divide
We walked the floor
Now we don't go there anymore

In the great divide
Nothin' to decide
No one else to care for or love
In the great divide

On the railroad town

In my heart but you

  And the dreams that you're havin'

And over the crowd

Where wind was blowin'
Right through your hair

And daddy were there

That my life would come to this,

That my friends would turn to foes,

Neil Young,"On the hill where Custer was,
Making his last stand,
With the Indians all around,
And his gun in his hand.

Such a wind was blowing that day,
Through the battleground,
I could feel it in my hair,
As I turned towards downtown.

Weaving through the buildings,
Cutting though the streets,
Slicing through the culture,
Piling on the weeks.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.

Dropping in on you my friend,
Is just like old times,
Said the fool who signed the paper,
To assorted slimes.

It's hard to get blood from a stone
But for you I'll give it a try,
To provide your accomodations,
And leave you satisfied.

You'd think it was easy,
To give your life away,
To not have to live up to,

Going home.

Elusively she cut the phone,
Moved from cell to cell,
Really looking remarkable,
And obviously doing well.

She made a turn on a wooden bridge,
Into the battleground,
With a thousand warriors on the ridge,
She tried to turn her radio down.

Battle drums were pounding,
All around her car,
She saw her clothes were changing,
Into sky and stars.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.

Neil Young,"The painter stood before her work;
She looked around everywhere.
She saw the pictures and she painted them
She picked the colors from the air

Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow in the light.
Black to black when the evening comes.
Blue to blue in the night.

It's a long road behind me.
It's a long road ahead.
If you follow every dream,
You might get lost.
If you follow every dream,
You might get lost.

She towed the line.
She held her end up.
She did the work of too many.
But in the end, she fell down
Before she got up again.

We leave our tracks in the sound.
Some of them are with me now.
Some of them can't be found.

Just taking care of it now
It's been around for years and years
Just waiting in its old case
It's been up and down the country roads
It's brought a tear and a smile
It's seen its share of dreams and hopes
And never went out of style
The more I play it, the better it sounds
It cries when I leave it alone
Silently it waits for me
Or someone else I suppose

This old guitar

This old guitar

This old guitar has caught some breaks
But it never searched for gold
It can't be blamed for my mistakes
It only does what it's told
It's been a messenger in times of trouble
In times of hope and fear
When I get drunk and seeing double
It jumps behind the wheel and steers

Now watch the summer pass

Too late to pay,
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave.

Are waitresses paying the price of their winking?
While stars sit in bars and decide what their drinking,
They drop by to die 'cause it's faster than sinking.

While stars sit in bars and decide
What their drinking,
They drop by to die 'cause it's
Faster than sinking.

Neil Young,"In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner forty niner,
And his daughter Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy,
And her shoes were number nine,
Herring boxes, without topses,
Sandals were for Clementine.

Clementine! Clementine!
Oh my darling, Clementine!

Drove she ducklings to the water
Every morn just at nine,
Hit her foot against a splinter,
Fell into the foaming brine.

Ruby lips above the water,
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,
But, alas, I was no swimmer,
So I lost my Clementine.

Clementine! Clementine!
Oh my darling, Clementine!

And the minor forty niner 
Soon began to peak and pine
Thought he oughta join his daughter
Now he's left with Clementine

In my dreams she still upon me
Broken garments soaked in brine
Though in life I used to hug her,
In death I draw the line

Clementine! Clementine!
Oh my darling, Clementine!
(Oh my darling, oh my darling)

How I missed her! How I missed her,
How I missed my Clementine,
So I kissed her little sister,
And I forgot my Clementine.

I'm thirty-five, we got a boy, of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
This is your hometown",My Hometown [*]
Neil Young,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
And wander in my words
Dream about the pictures that I play of changes

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow, they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade of changes

Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind
Visions of shadows that shine
One day I returned and found they were
Victims of the vines of changes

The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
It swings through a hollow of haze
A race around the stars
A journey through the universe ablaze with changes

Moments of magic will glow in the night
Fears of the forest are all gone
But when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes

Passions will part to a strange melody
As fires will sometimes burn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes

Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shores of changes",Changes
Neil Young,"I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do
crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
I'm crazy for loving you

I'm crazy for crying
I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for loving you",Crazy
Neil Young,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, 707's set to go
And I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows
And the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Yeah, there she goes my friend, she's going down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away in westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly

Where the morning rain don't fall, where the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport has brought me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain",Early Morning Rain
Neil Young,"If you're travelin' in the North Country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends
Please see for me, she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

If you're travelin' the North Country fair
Where other winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine",Girl from the North Country
Neil Young,"I wonder if I care as much
As I did before

Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day,
And wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more

I wonder if I care as much
As I did before

My pride is made to say forgive
And take the blame for what you did
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of
I wonder if I'm still in love
My heart can't thrive on misery
My life it has no destiny
When things get more
Than I can bear
I ask myself, do I still care?
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before",I Wonder If I Care as Much
Neil Young,"If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet

You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can see

If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstore sells
When you reach the part where the heartaches
Come the hero would be me

but heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just to hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two, a movie queen
To play the scene of bringing
All the good things out in me
oh for now love let's be real

I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet the story always ends

If you read between the lines
You'll find that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack

I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back",If You Could Read My Mind
Neil Young,"When sadness fills your heart
And sorrow hides the longing to be free
When things go wrong with each day
You fix your mind to escape your misery

Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

How strange your happy words
Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once walked among

Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

One grain of pure white snow
Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain

And your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

Your mother stands a'cryin'
While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past

And your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

Through ages, man's desires
To free his mind, to release his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore

And your troubled young life
Might make you turn
To the needle of death",Needle of Death
Neil Young,"On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I just can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I just can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way

Is on the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

Neil Young,"If I listen long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced
While I cried

Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give
Never thinking of myself

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing how you lied straight-faced
While I cried

Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without somebody else",Reason to Believe
Neil Young,"Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby

That I am not the same

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
For I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby

And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two

manca poco per la città 
vado forte perché 
sto tornando da te 
scorre giù la periferia 
tutta uguale nella foschia

see'è più nebbia che via 
è un rischio correre lo so 
però di tempo non ne ho 
e la distanza è troppa se 
penso a te 
penso a te 

andare partire, tornare 
sentire la strada che entra nel cuore 
la radio sempre accesa mi aiuta a pensare mi fa compagnia 
ho già la testa a casa 

ma see'è un blocco di polizia 
è proprio dietro il cavalcavia 
vetri rotti qua e la 
e l'ambulanza che va 
oltre i rottami niente see'è 
scendo dall'auto poi mi fermo a guardare 
forse è un ragazzo come noi, come me e penso forte a te 

andare partire tornare 
mi dici a vent'anni chi vuole morire 
ma quando ci sei dentro non vai mai a pensare 
che capiti a te, oh a te 
e ancora andare partire tornare 
ognuno ha qualcuno che sta ad aspettare 
e io non vedo l'ora ti voglio toccare 
capire non puoi, voglio esser certo che ci sei 

e see'è la luce lassù 
e see'è un ombra sei tu 
farò le scale due a due 
due mani le tue 

andare partire tornare 
già dormi ti poso un orecchio sul cuore 
lo sento mentre batte e pian piano scompare

quest'ansia che ho

Che non mi è mai passata

Laura non c'è, capisco che
È stupido cercarla in te

Magari c'è un altro accanto a lei
Giuro non ci ho pensato mai

Però non è lo stesso tra di noi
Da solo non mi basto, stai con me

Credo che sia logico
Per quanto io provi a scappare, lei c'è

Que no enseñan todo lo que quiero ver
Y sólo por seguir tus pasos, he olvidado
Otros nombres de mujer no hay pasado si no estás en él

Si me miras así tú siempre me puedes
Ojos de perfil que me hacen sucumbir
Y no hay más ley que tu boca diciendo
Que quieres que pruebe no te importa el lugar
Si quieres cobrar besos impacientes

Vas a hacer que pierda la cabeza, sabes
Cómo te debes mover
Y me dan vértigo esas piernas, que no enseñan
Todo lo que quiero ver

No sé quién te enseñó a quererme, pero siempre
Me vuelves a sorprender
Márcame el ritmo y yo te seguiré
Hasta que comience a amanecer

Y el tiempo no le hará daño a nuestra pasión
Y cada noche será la noche mejor
Soy el que juega a tus juegos prohibidos

Haces que pierda la cabeza, sabes
Cómo te debes mover
Y me dan vértigo esas piernas que no enseñan
Todo lo que quiero ver

Y sólo por seguir tus pasos he olvidado
Otros nombres de mujer
Márcame el ritmo y yo te seguiré
Quiero ser parte de tí

Y sólo sé que todo está al revés
Tiene tu nombre las letras de mi desorden
T me grita sin tí la soledad

Entre los dos tu olvido y mi pasión
T tu ausencia acorralando el corazón
T yo mintiéndome jurando que te olvidé
Entre los dos con este tu adios golpeando mi razón
(No sé qué pasó)

Me pierdo si no estoy
Perdido en tus derroches
Mis sentidos malheridos
Sin tu piel tus recuerdos son

Hoy otra vez más dulces
Por querer me jugué
Todo el número perdedor

Entre los dos tu olvido y mi pasión
Y tu ausencia acorralando al corazón
Entre los dos un sueño se rompió
Quién me roba cada puesta de tu sol

Mi amor di que es mentira
Que todo es una pesadilla
Entre los dos borremos el dolor
Mi amor que todavía
Tu vida es parte de la mía

Entres los dos, tu olvido y mi pasión
(Toda mi pasión)
Entre los dos, tu olvido y mi pasión
Y tu ausencia acorralando al corazón

Entre los dos, un sueño se rompió
Quién me roba cada puesta de tu sol
Entre los dos, tu olvido y mi pasión

Sin tí ya no soy yo, que tu ausencia
Me acorrala el corazón

Fué el destino quién jugó a cruzar
Nuestras miradas en un bar
Y lo demás vino después

No teniamos nada que perder
Y la noche estaba a nuestros pies
Tú querías robarme el corazón
Y yo iba asomándome en el balcón
Que tu escote me dejaba ver

Por qué quiso el azar que conociera
Cada secreto de tu intimidad
Mil besos de sal en las aceras

Sólo yo contigo y nadie más
Y la hora que cierran la ciudad
Y la luna del amanecer
Me alumbró el camino que da a tu piel
Bajo la penumbra de un portal

Por qué quiso el azar que conociera
Cada secreto de tu intimidad
Baile de dos en las aceras
Subiendo por tus caderas

Sin parar
De volver a besar
Y sin dejar de soñar
Y vuelta a empezar

tan solo mis besos calman tu sed

llegas tú, sueño imposible, tú
hoy seré dueño de tu piel
pero tus besos mienten
quién robó tu amor
dímelo

he encontrado entre mi ropa
el vestido que yo ayer
con mis dedos tan despacio te quité

soñaré tu piel desnuda
te soñaré tan infinita como dios
cuando tu mundo sólo era mío

llegas tú, sueño imposible, tú
hoy seré dueño de tu piel
pero tus besos mienten
quién robó tu amor

llegas tú, sueño imposible, tú
lógico, sé que arriesgaré
si te amo quizá pierda
si no te amo, sé que no ganaré

y me dices que quisieras encontrar tu libertad
se te olvida que en mis brazos volará

llegas tú, sueño imposible, tú
hoy seré dueño de tu piel
pero tus besos mienten
quién robó tu amor

Nek,"Se desnuda el alba sobre la playa
Arde el cielo para nosotros, incendio del amanecer
Abrazándote siento lo que antes yo nunca sentí
Es un brevísimo instante pero es importante porque ya sé

Que esta vez
No te voy a perder me entregas tu alegría
Cada noche y cada día
No es fantasía, sabes que eres mía

Llega el sol y un día más
Este amor me hace soñar
No tiene sentido mi destino
Si me faltas tú

Llega el soly y un día más
Eres mi única verdad
Si se acaba el mundo en un segundo
Siempre estarás tú

Y no tengo miedo cuando abrazo tu cuerpo
Y me prometes en medio de un beso
Que nunca me vas a dejar
El tiempo se detiene y sólo se oyen las olas
Y por tu amor navegará mi corazón

Llega el sol y un día más
Este amor me hace soñar
No tiene sentido mi destino
Si me faltas tú

Llega el sol y una día más
Eres mi única verdad
No hay nada más cierto
Que tu cuerpo nada más que tú

Yo no sé de leyes de la vida
Si el universo es un progreso, una armonía
Y si está escrito ya que tú eres mía
Sólo mía

Llega el sol y un día más
Eres mi única verdad
No tiene sentido mi destino
Cuando tú no estás

De todas mis canciones el motor
Es tu amor

No habrá de nuevo vuelta atrás
Parece que no te controlas
Y quieres mi complicidad

Me dices que lo estás logrando
Que intentarás demostrarte esta vez
Que la amsitad podrá ayudarte en esto
Yo sólo quiero recordarte que

Volverás a vivir, ccuando quieras salir
Planta cara a la realidad
No digas que te faltan fuerzas
Tú sabes bien que esta es tu guerra
No te busques un pretexto, yo apuesto
A que ganarás

Me dices que no soy tu padre
Que tú ya sabes lo que hacer
La rabia te hace ser el que no eres
Desahógate conmigo si eso te hace bien

Que no te de vergüenza tener miedo
Quiero ayudarte a escapar de esta prisión
Me quedaré a tu lado todo el tiempo
Perdo a tu juego siempre diré que no

Volverás a vivir cuando quieras salir
Planta cara a la realidad
No digas que te faltan fuerzas
Tú sabes bien que esta es tu guerra
No te busques un pretexto, yo apuesto
A que ganarás

No me digas que pierdo el tiempo
Tú ya me conoces, no voy a dejarte cær
Si me golpeas yo me defiendo
No puedes pedir, que me aleje de tí

Volverás a vivir cuando quieras salir
Planta cara a la realidad
Que cada cuál tiene su guerra
Y hay que luchar para ganarla
No te busques un pretexto, yo apuesto
A que ganarás, yo apuesto a que ganarás

L'aereo sembra fermo
La notte è un grande schermo
Con la terra sotto di me
E l'Africa è una macchia
Come una lingua in una bocca
Che non la fanno neanche parlare
C'è una mano tesa che chiede se può lavorare
Con la terra sotto di me
Un tipo in un maglione
Al bar della stazione
Si sta mangiando le unghie perché
Aspetta l'uomo senza faccia
Lo aspettano le sue braccia
Spingerà quell'ago a fondo nel cuore
Per vedere se morire è come viaggiare
O se fa più male

E qui la radio trasmette un programma di musica 
E io non trovo risposte nessuno le dà
Il comandante dice ci siamo già 
È come quando spezza il filo di un film
La pubblicità

Con la terra sotto di me
I lampi degli spari
Che ammazzano I pensieri
Di chi va in guerra senza un perché
Ma è spedito là da certi vecchi
Per difenderne gli interessi
Però quando un ragazzo muore e va giù
Ne parlano un secondo in tv
E poi niente di più

Verte ahí desnuda en la cocina muñequita

anche se e inevitabile 
mi chiedo ancora adesso 
avrei potuto accorgermi 
della rabbia dentro te 

where was i when you tumbled down 
oh when you needed me around 
i think about all we might have shared 
i think about you without me 
e il mio ricordo naviga 
the anger you needed to hide

quando eravamo cielo e terra 
e di un amico la metÃ  
in ogni dubbio e in ogni veritÃ  
quando eravamo la stessa pelle 
la stessa luce nel corpo e nell'anima 

sad is the soul that walks alone 
cold is the wind, hard is the road 
sono colpevole lo sai 
se ti ho lasciato solo 
came into my life again 
tra noi lo stesso battito 
and time would never make us feel betrayed 
and on that day 

heaven and earth we'd walk as angels 
heaven and earth we'd shine like friends 
ocean and sky we'd search our eyes and there 
find ourselves 
heaven and earth as close as brothers 
knowing each others innocent hearts so well 
cosÃ¬ mentre io cammino e vado via 
senza mai voltarmi 
and let the early hours bring us home 
again 
bring us home again 
e dimenticare

Fuori da questa confusione
Dove perde il nome la realtà
Preferisco il suono

E l'armonia delle mie corde
L'intimo calore che mi da
Tutto corre in fretta
E non va sempre in linea retta

Ma sento l'importanza
Che ha per me la tua presenza
Il fuoco dell'assenza
Che mi fa dire ancora ?non cambiare mai'

Sono tutte qui
Tra I miei brividi
Tutte insieme a te
Le cose da difendere

Sono tutte qui
E la prima rimani tu
Altre non ce n'è
Sotto il segno del mio vivere

Così mi rendo conto
Che io di nuovo sono pronto
Per affrontare il mondo insieme a te

Perché non sento la paura
Dei giorni nuovi che verranno
Perché le mie emozioni
Continueranno fino in fondo a dirmi che

Sono tutte qui
Come brividi
Tutte dentro me

Altre non ce n'è

Las dudas, los sexos, me explotan contra el pecho

Olvida los temores de un problema que no fué
Dame el tiempo de aclararte todos tus porqués

Las dudas, los sexos, me explotan contra el pecho

Tras de un sí que no sale

Al menos ahora, nos miramos sin volver la cara
Al menos ahora, te dan ganas de entregarte toda

Gritarás tú mi nombre

CambierÃ  e prima o poi lei capirÃ 
CederÃ  tua madre mi conoscerÃ 
Anche a piedi correrÃ² se mi chiami
Ed il cuore batterÃ  nelle mani
CrollerÃ  l'Himalaia ma noi no
TroverÃ² casa 18 anni tu li avrai tra un po'
Col maglione sopra i fianchi
Ce ne andremo in periferia
LÃ  i ragazzi sono in tanti
E si scambiano piÃ¹ energia
LÃ  nessuno ci fa caso
Puoi vestirti come vuoi

Angeli nel ghetto
Anime da gatto abbiamo il diritto
Di amarci un po' io ti voglio addosso
Come un mare mosso
Con gli anfibi camminiamo noi
In un tempo che non passa mai liberi

CambierÃ  e prima o poi lavorerÃ²
CambierÃ  oh si e qualche lira girerÃ 
E' una sfida contro il mondo questo amore
Con te crescerÃ² senza mai un dolore
Io ti stringerÃ² e mi addormenterÃ² con te

Angeli nel ghetto anime da gatto
La vita dÃ  addosso il cielo su di noi
Gireremo a vuoto
Due sopra una moto
Coi capelli quando guiderai
Piano il viso mi schiaffeggerai
Angeli nel ghetto anime da gatto
Nessuno mai ci deruberÃ  della nostra etÃ 
E sotto le stelle pelle contro pelle
Le carezze tenteremo noi
Quelle che non ci hanno dato mai
Angeli nel ghetto
Angeli nel ghetto io ti sento addosso
Sopra a una panchina scriverai
""Oggi qui ci siamo stati noi""
Angeli nel ghetto ritorniamo a casa
E sola nel tuo letto mi penserai
Spegnerai la luce e sarai felice
Il cuscino caldo girerai
Sospirando t'accarezzerai
Sorridendo ti addormenterai
Sognando noi",Angeli Nel Ghetto
Nek,"Stanco di me
Stanco di tutto
Stanco di questi giorni
Che si piegano su me

Stanco di chi mi scalda il letto
Di causa effetto
Di slealta' e di banalita'
Mi stendo di sonnifero tra un po'

Almeno dormiro'
Traversero' strade che ho perso
Zone scordate che non so
E voglie che non ho

E trovero' anime sparse
In questa nebbia densa
Che non ci si vede piu'

Ma un giorno
Tutto questo cambiera'
E l'anno zero andra'
E l'anno zero andra'

Io ti vorro'
Anche se sbagli
E se la tua diversita'
A te mi leghera'

Una fottuta guerra non verra'
Soltanto qualche schiaffo alla realta'
Se l'anno zero andra'
E l'anno zero andra'

Ed una nuova luce squarcera' un cielo
Che nessuno ha visto mai, mai, mai
E l'anno zero andra'
E l'anno zero andra'
E l'anno zero andra'

Ma l'anno zero va

Nek,"Con gli occhi gonfi ti riaggiusti un pÃ²
nello specchietto vedi un mostro tu
ma non Ã¨ il fuori a preoccuparti no
Ã¨ tutto il resto che ci butta giÃ¹.
Un conto Ã¨ parlarne con le amiche tue
ma a fare l'amore si Ã¨ soltanto in due,
poi l'esperienza see'Ã¨ o non see'Ã¨...
La prima volta puÃ² deludere,
dicevi ""FÃ  piano"" ed io pensavo a me
mi chiedi persino se sei frigida
volevi soltanto andassi via da te.
Se sei andata in crisi see'Ã¨ un perchÃ¨
tu eri bambina e non lo sai piÃ¹
che non Ã¨ come immaginavi tu...

Dai, dai, dai, cuori in tempesta siamo noi
fuori di testa adesso sei
e certamente mi odierai...amore...
Dai, dai, dai, perchÃ¨ se hai detto una bugia
quelle menate a casa mia
l'avevi fatto giÃ  e invece poi...

Andiamo al centro, passeggiamo, vuoi?
Da una vetrina forse scoprirai
che le unghie a pelle non mangi piÃ¹
e all'improvviso capiremo noi
che non Ã¨ un problemo di verginitÃ ,
si Ã¨ certo piÃ¹ donne quando non si ha,
ma quel che graffia dentro Ã¨ il crescere

Dai, dai, dai cuori in tempesta siamo noi
fuori di testa adesso sei
piccola frana, mi odierai...amore...
Dai, dai, dai, ci sono stato attento sai
ma sto da cani come te, ti sto vicino dai
Guardiamo bene sul calendario, non ci sei rimasta vedrai
semplici ritardi, ed un labbro mordi
se mi va bene non lo faccio o piÃ¹

Chiamami, ci chiuderemo in camera
le bocche suol telefono
ci rideremo su noi due
adesso, dai, dai, dai cuori in tempesta siamo noi
anche buddista mi farei
per far piacere a te, a te, per te...",Cuori in Tempesta
Nek,"Risalirò col suo peso sul petto 
Come una carpa il fiume 
Mi spalmerò sulla faccia rossetto 
Per farlo ridere 
Per lui poi comprerò 
Sacchetti di pop-corn

Per lui non fumerò 
A quattro zampe andrò 
E lo aiuterò a crescere 

Lui vive in te 
Si muove in te 
Con mani cucciole 
È in te 
Respira in te 
Gioca e non sa 
Che tu vuoi buttarlo via 

La sera poi 
Con noi due farà il bagno 
E vi insaponerò 
Per lui mi cambierò 
La notte ci sarò 
Perché non resti solo mai

La moto venderò 
E lo proteggerò, aiutami

È in te, si scalda in te

Dai tuoi seni berrà 
Con i pugni vicini 
Tra noi dormirà 
E un pò scalcerà

È già con noi

Nek,"Qué hundidos ojos, qué mirada, amor
En tu espejito ves un monstruo, tú
No es lo de fuera tu preocupación
Es todo el resto, toda tu inquietud
Se cuenta entre amigas como es el amor
Mas cuando lo hacemos sólo somos dos
Y la experiencia, ¿sé o no sé?

La vez primera puede defraudar
Decías ""despacio"" y yo pensaba en mí
Dudabas incluso si eras frígida
Decías tan sólo vete ya de aquí
Tuviste una crisis, fue porque
Tu fuiste una niña con tu ineptitud
No es como ayer te imaginabas tú

Somos dos
Dos corazones, tú y yo
Dos corazones sin domar
Tú ciertamente me odiarás
Mi vida, déjalo
Porque si me mentiste un día
Diciendo que eras sólo mía
Lo habías hecho ya
Y en cambio, yo

Si quieres ir al centro a pasear
Un escaparate te descubrirá
Que ya las uñas no te comes tú
Comprenderemos de repente que
Que no es un problema de virginidad
Que se es más mujer si se ha perdido ya
Mas lo que hiere de verdad es crecer

Somos dos
Dos corazones, tú y yo
Dos corazones sin domar
Tú ciertamente me odiarás

He estado atento, y cómo no
No somos únicos, amor

La que el escote me enseñó
La que me provocó)

Miremos bien ese calendario
No te habrás quedado, verás
Un simple retraso, te muerdes el labio
Si es una alarma ya no lo hago más, oh

Somos dos
Dos tempestades, tú y yo
A casa te acompañaré
Te echo de menos, ven, oh si eh

Llámame
Me encerraré en mi habitación
Me comeré el teléfono

Como una carpa el río
Me pintaré de payaso si es eso

Por él yo compraré palomas de maíz
Pondrá el coche de lástima
Por él no fumaré, a gatas andaré
Y le veré crecer, le ayudaré

Él vive en ti
Se mueve en ti
Con sus manitas

Esperaré a que hable)
Nos meteremos los tres en el baño

Nek,"Io non ti chiedo niente
Il tuo saluto indifferente mi basta
Ma tu non puoi più farmi

Male da starci male
Non vali più di questa luna spenta

Ricorda che dicevi a me

Lascia che io sia 
Il tuo brivido più grande
Non andare via accorciamo le distanze

Nelle lunghe attese tra di noi
Io non ho confuso mai
Braccia sconosciute con le tue

E parli e scherzi e ridi
Ti siedi e poi mi escludi sento addosso

Sorrisi che conosco sorrisi sulla pelle

Quando eravamo terra e stelle
Adesso se tu mi vuoi e se lo vuoi

Lascia che io sia 
Il tuo brivido più grande
E non andare via accorciamo le distanze

Nelle lunghe attese tra di noi
Io non ho confuso mai
I tuoi pensieri mi sfiorano
Ti vengo incontro e più niente è importante
Solo... 

E se lo vuoi 
Lascia che io sia 
Il tuo brivido più grande
E non andare via non sei più così distante
Quello che see'è stato tra di noi
Io non l'ho confuso mai
I tuoi pensieri mi sfiorano
Ed il passato si arrende al presente

Translation from Italian

I do not ask you anything
Your indifferent greeting is enough for me
You no longer have the power to hurt me enough to make me feel bad
This spent moon doesn?t matter anymore

He remembers what you would say to me

Leave me be
Your greatest thrill
Don?t go away
Let?s shorten the distance

In the long waits between us
I have never been confused
Arms unfamiliar with yours

And you speak and joke and laugh
You sit and then you exclude me
I feel crooked

Smiles that I know, smiles on the skin

When we were earth and stars
Now if you want me and if you want it

Leave me be
Your largest thrill
And don?t go away
Let?s shorten the distance

In the long waits between us
I have never been confused
Your thoughts graze me
You and I encounter and nothing is more important
Only?

And if you want it
Lave me be
Your largest thrill
And don?t go away you?re not so far
That which has been between us
I have never confused it
Your thoughts graze me
And the past surrenders the present

Y tú estás más guapa que ayer
Como una ola en el océano
Si pudiera pediré, más de mil siglos de ti
Y de mí

Que mi única verdad en ti tendré

Juntos, huyamos, conmigo ven en ese tren
Como en un film veamos pasar el año que queda atrás

Por la vía de la realidad
Caminamos juntos
Piensa que esto es lo que hay

Duerme algo, que el alba ya llegará
Hazme un regalo, sonríeme, qué guapa estás
Despierta que nos vamos, que el mundo a contramano se va

Viviremos con lo que vendrá
Y lo haremos solos
Ahora todo habla de los dos
Por la vía de la realidad
Caminamos juntos
Piensa que esto es lo que hay

Lo que quieras tú tendrás
Por dos días reirás
Verás
Que en nada pensarás

Viviremos con lo que vendrá
Y lo haremos solos
Ahora todo habla de los dos
Por la vía de la realidad
Caminamos juntos
Piensa que esto es lo que hay",A Contramano

Gracias por las cosas íntimas
Que cuando tú no estás dejaste aquí

Que me recuerdan que volviste a mí

Gracias si cuando te quiero y no hablo lo sabes ya
Gracias por ese perfume envolvente que me enredará

Daría todo lo que tengo y más
Por abrazarte ahora un poco más
Porque apretándote a mi pecho yo soy tú y tú eres yo
Haz que el silencio no se vuelva a hacer
Que yo te sienta cuando tú no estés
Y que al alzar los ojos yo te vuelva a ver

Las casas bajas distanciándose, y el aire cambia ya

No vale un adiós, la noche es testigo
Porque el alba vuelve siempre al mismo sitio

Y una cita sale a tu encuentro
Nunca llegues con retraso
Que tu vida… te espera ya
Oh… ya, oh… ya

Y es que así vas pensando tú

Nek,"Io che salgo a piedi lungo questo pendio
Che non ricordo l'indirizzo di dio
Ed ho riempito di parole il silenzio
Per cogliere il senso di un abbandono

Io che ho preso treni per sentirne il rullio
Per ragionare su un futuro che spio
Anche se il viaggio mi ha prestato altre mani
Sei tu che rimani

E mi pesa quest'assenza questa falsa indifferenza
Smonta I miei alibi fragili forti all'apparenza
Certe volte la distanza può anche essere violenta
Va oltre I miei limiti fisici e non mi da speranza

Io sono qui con te
Io sono qui per te
E resto qui se vuoi
Perché tu qui ci sei

Io tra I mulinelli di un inutile addio
Come una chiesa sconsacrata che ormai
Non ha risposte ma bestemmie tra I denti
E notti perdenti ti voglio quindi

Io scendo dal treno che fa un viaggio non mio
E il cigolare dei rumori è un fruscio
Quella stazione puoi chiamarla perdono
Per quel che può un uomo

Stringo piano le tue mani come fossero gabbiani
Capaci di andare via da un'idea senza più prigioni
Se ti curvi sul mio corpo tesa nel respiro grosso
Se credi negli attimi tu sei già dentro il mio percorso

Io sono qui con te
Io sono qui per te
E resto qui se vuoi
Perché tu qui ci sei

Io sono qui
E resto qui
Ormai

Corre il giorno come un telegramma vedi
Le ore perse sono una condanna credi
E ogni tua protesta fermerò con la mia bocca

Il passato non è niente solo un furto al mio presente
E quindi rilassati stringimi libera la mente

Io sono qui con te
Io sono qui per te
E resto qui se vuoi
Perché tu qui ci sei

Io sono qui

Se me va tras de ti

Me faltan tus atrasos, tus brazos
¿dónde están?

Dime cuántas veces, demasiadas veces

Tantas ocasiones, cuántas decisiones
Y la certeza que tú me entendieras aún
Ahora que te pierdo comprendo quién es quién

Dime cuántas veces, demasiadas veces
Cuando me equivoqué, dime al menos por qué
Dame algo de tiempo, ese es el derecho
Que le puede quedar a esa parte de mí

Nek,"Spesso capita se insegui quel che vuoi
Che non apprezzi quel che hai 
Per esempio io vivo la mia libertà 
Ma qualcuno muore per difenderla

Il tuo viso che si appoggia sopra il mio
È normale che ci sia nei giorni miei
Ma se non ci fosse io quali giorni avrei

Fino a che ci sei
I miei occhi su di te 
Che si perdono dove inizia il tuo abbandono
Sono attimi non certezze penso che 
Il miracolo è che tu sia qui per me

Spesso capita cercando non so che
Che si perda quello che già c?è
E ora voglio solamente quel che ho
Me ne accorgo quando ti allontani un po?
Io me ne accorgo quando t? allontani un po?

Fino a che ci sei 
I tuoi occhi su di me che si perdono
Dove inizia il mio abbandono
Sono attimi ma stanotte penso che
Il miracolo è che tu sei qui

E fino a che ci sei I miei occhi su di te
Che ti cercano nel lasciarti andare piano
Sono attimi da fermare quando vuoi
Per rubare al tempo attimi di noi

Permettimi di dire che qui,
È solo l'odio che fa notizia,
In ogni maledetto tg,
Non c'è più l'ombra di quel rispetto,

Ho capito solo che l'amore non ha manuale di istruzioni
E tu sei ancora mia nonostante Freud
Dica che non siamo compatibili come iOS e Android
L'unica che non manderei via la mattina dopo
Freud dice che quando ti amo poi non ti desidero
Eppure ti vorrei prendere in piedi in mezzo alla cucina
Come una calamita appesa al frigorifero

Questo lo dice Freud
E una colpa anche tu l'avrai
Ti hanno detto non si fa, ma sotto sotto vuoi

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro, un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé
Qualcuno l'ha scritto
Sul muro qui sotto
«Freud è uno di noi»

E non saremo mai una Polaroid
Da tabloid, né supereroi

«Freud è uno di noi!»

E balleremo poi, in equilibrio sui rasoi
Ma decidiamo noi, noi

Questo lo dice Freud
Io direi che non si sa mai

Che dice che l'amore è una psicosi non m'importa (no)
Sto bene con la giacca e la camicia di forza

Questo lo dice Freud
Che qualcosa nasconderai

E non curiamo il sintomo
E non cerchiamo un simbolo
A volte per l'amore, a volte un sigaro
È soltanto un sigaro

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro, un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé
Qualcuno l'ha scritto
Sul muro qui sotto
«Freud è uno di noi»

E non saremo mai una polaroid
Da tabloid, né supereroi

«Freud è uno di noi»

E balleremo poi, in equilibrio sui rasoi
Ma decidiamo noi, noi

Questo lo dice Freud
Devi mordere prima o poi
Cerchi sempre con la bocca quello che non hai
Io non so cosa sia
Ma la pelle non cambia idea
Che l'amore fatto bene mica è una teoria

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro o un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé
Qualcuno l'ha scritto
Sul muro qui sotto
«Freud è uno di noi»

E non saremo mai una polaroid
Da tabloid, né supereroi

«Freud è uno di noi»

E balleremo poi, in equilibrio sui rasoi
Ma decidiamo noi
Dopo secoli di quadri romanzi e canzoni
Ho capito che in questa materia
Al posto di neutroni e protoni
Ci sono visioni, emozioni ed ormoni
L'amore non ha manuale di istruzioni",Freud
Nek,"Uno di questi giorni andiamo via
Penseranno che ci siamo persi, che la colpa è mia
E tu metti un bel vestito, quello giusto
Quello che ti toglierei
Se chiudi gli occhi, giuro che ti porto dove vuoi
Ci siamo solamente noi
Solamente noi
Finché mi resti addosso il mondo è nostro
Cadremo e ne verranno di inverni
Abbracciami e dormi
Uno di questi giorni, andiamo via

Dillo pure a tutti che non torni
Cosa vuoi che sia
Io che sono sempre, anzi troppo io
E mi riconoscerai anche a luci spente
Si comincia dall’amore in poi
Ci siamo solamente noi
Solamente noi

Finché mi resti addosso, il mondo è nostro
E niente è come noi
Veramente noi
È più di un giuramento contro tutto
Cadremo e ne verranno di inverni
Abbracciami e dormi
Uno di questi giorni ti porto via
Uno di questi giorni, qualunque sia
Andiamo via
Uno di questi giorni

Ci siamo solamente noi
Solamente noi
Finché mi resti addosso, il mondo è nostro
Cadremo e ne verranno di inverni
Abbracciami e dormi
Noi qui come chi arriva da lontano
Noi qui quelli chi fa pace col destino
E poi qualunque sia uno di questi giorni
Uno di questi giorni
Andiamo via",Uno Di Questi Giorni

Las rosas del desierto 
También en los balcones
La historia ha dado ya 
Las frases más brillantes

Memoria de elefante
Comparten la ciudad

Y un beso cruzará 
Diversos continentes

Otro millón de veces
La posibilidad 
Estará siempre contigo
El tiempo te dirá 
Que el primero está solo

Fuimos navegando hasta la luna 
A hacer la foto que 
Miraremos en casa
Alguno ha dicho que 
Ya estaba todo dicho 
Pero cambió de idea 
Muriendo en un abrazo

Y hay un recuerdo que no se nos va
O la calle quedó a la mitad
Dos como tú y yo
No los verán jamás

Hay agua en el desierto 
Y arena por los mares
Ninguna novedad 
Sobre esta madre Tierra 
Porque encontrarte es ya 
La mayor recompensa

Reuf

C'est pour mes frères et sœurs d'une autre mère
On a acquis le statut d'famille
Mon reuf a toujours couvert mes arrières
J'continuerai de mentir à sa petite amie
Ma mère peut l'engueuler comme si c'était son fils
S'il s'tape, je vais sauter d'office dans la mêlée (ouais!)
Même si mes habits coûtent cher, c'est la même
Même si c'est lui qu'a cherché la merde
C'est vrai qu'il est pas réaliste, j'ai les boules de le voir
Décevoir ses rents-pa et perdre son temps
On est trente sur la liste, on déboule devant la boite
Y'en a un qui rentre pas? Personne rentre!
J'suis le seul à te voir quand t'as pas les cheveux lissés
Notre équipe était massive au lycée, et tu le sais
Dans mon équipe, y'avait quasiment que des têtes cramées
J'étais celui qu'on envoyait pour paraître civilisés
Des urgences, des mariages, des naissances
Des procès, des nuits blanches et des micro-siestes
Tous mes amis en ont dans le ventre
Mais ça ne se voit pas comme un déni d'grossesse

C'est pour mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey
Je te parle de mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey

Traîtres, on les fuck
Les vrais, pas les faux
L'Entourage bébé, reuf, Seine Zoo

J'ai passé mon adolescence à voler secrètement
Si je te disais que je regrette, ce serait te mentir
Maintenant, je sais que tu peux te faire serrer demain
Et rien ne vaut le sentiment de vivre sereinement
La vie n'est qu'une escale, et ton corps n'est qu'un emprunt
Tu te plains, mais pense à la mort parce qu'elle est encore pire
Grosse galère, on escaladait les grilles des immeubles
Afin de s'caler dans les cages d'escalier pour dormir
On était ensemble pour la mettre à l'envers dans tous les endroits
Pour ves-qui la sécurité, faut du sang froid
Je sais le vide que ça laisse en toi
Sans ma plus fidèle amie, je serais sûrement sans toit

C'est pour mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey

Avec mes pèlerins, on faisait qu'emmerder l'monde
Sur le chemin de l'amitié, j'ai fait de belles rencontres
Mais j'ai grandi, pas besoin de t'alerter, m'man
Quand on part dans nos délires, on a l'air tellement cons
J'étais qu'un petit quand mes Kabyles m'ont surnommé ""Fennec""
S-Crew, 2001, bébé
À l'époque, on n'avait pas besoin de se téléphoner
Pour s’appeler, fallait siffler en-dessous des fenêtres
On s'donne tellement d'trucs, on est quitte
Langage cru quand on prend des cuites
Open bar, on le brûle en équipe
Open mic, on le brûle en équipe
Ma meilleure amie porte le voile, elle est mignonne
J'ouvre pas ma porte à n'importe qui, j'm'en bats les roubignoles
J'mets tous mes potos dans mes clips
Même ceux qu'ont la même tête qu'Igor
On a appris à devenir des hommes
Ici, la vie te cogne à tour de bras
Je me dis qu'il faut qu'on veille les uns sur les autres

Nekfeu,"Je suis devenu celui dont aurait rêvé celui que je rêvais d'être
Tu me suis? Je ne veux pas me réveiller
Une marque de luxe m'a dit ""On veut pas de Rap.""
Tu connais les ches-ri
J'ai dit ""Tant pis, tranquille, moi je parle ap'""
Le lendemain, je me suis tapé leur égérie
Elle avait le visage de Natalie Portman
Elle m'a dit ""Moi non plus je ne veux pas de vie de couple
Cette nuit, je veux me couper de ce monde qui dégoûte
Bébé, viens dans mon hôtel et on éteint les portables.""
J'en connais un rayon, je raconte pas de disquettes
Elle a mordu l'oreiller comme si c'était un cheesecake
Mais c'est toujours la même, elle a tenu mes mains
Elle m'a dit ""Tu m'aimes?"", j'ai dit ""Non, tu m'émeus.""
Je me répète, je n'ai pas de repère
Tu n'es pas la seule vraie perle de mon répertoire
Un soir, pété sous les réverbères
Peut-être que je me retournerais vers toi
Le temps passe je ne connais pas le surplace, j'ai
Fini pété au milieu des Champs, dans ma ville de champions
Je suis comme une bulle de champagne
Venu d'en bas je veux crever à la surface
Soirée bien arrosée, donnez-moi leur oseille
Le saumon sera rose et le champ' sera rosé
Mac Cain Family au stud, ça rappelle Woodstock
Cinq dans la Mini Austin, le son t'emmène à Houston

Je suis devenu celui dont aurait rêvé celui que je rêvais d'être
Tu me suis? Je ne veux pas me réveiller
La même marque de luxe m'a dit ""On veut bien ton Rap.""
Tu connais les ches-ri
J'ai dit ""Non, merci. J'ai monté ma propre marque
Et rappelez-moi de rappeler votre égérie.""
Je ne lui ai pas donné de nouvelles
On n'était pas naturels, on n'était pas nous-mêmes
Toujours en déplacement le soir
Mais c'qui compte c'est le dépassement de soi
Je me dois de profiter de la vie que je mène
Avant que le bonheur ne devienne un autre coup dur
Je n'avais pas les moyens de bien me saper
Maintenant, je m'applique dans la haute couture
J'ai vu des gens se noyer, je me permets de détailler
Les faits, dur de payer l'loyer quand le salaire est faible
En effet, se tailler les veines est devenu pour certains jeunes
Le seul moyen de se faire des grosses coupures

Vu ma cons', c'est sûr que j'suis high
Je me sens proche de L.A
Moi aussi, j'me suis construit sur des failles

Tout le monde est mauvais, ils aiment tellement la monnaie
Tu parles d'amitié mais tu pars
Dès que tu n'as plus besoin de mon aide
Même sous jet lag, j'reste un gentleman, menteur!
C'est dur d'être un jeune qui rejette le mal, mon cœur
Irradié aux rayons gamma, laisse-moi tirer d'la came
Je lis debout dans les rayons manga, parfois, on dirait un gamin
""T'es dangereux, Nekfeu, sur scène. Tu fais d'la merde, t'abuses!""
Prudence est mère de sûreté. Sûreté, ta mère la pute!
Ils veulent me filer des conseils, mon phone-télé vibre
Ils filment mes concerts au lieu de les vivre

Nekfeu,"On finit bêtes à la fin de nos soirées
On fait la fête jusqu'à ce que l'un de nous soit raide
Y'avait du monde mais je l'ai vu apparaître
Pâle comme une aquarelle, j'ai vu son ombre avant de la voir elle
Merveilleuse, sérieuse mais rieuse, périlleuse
Danse, mais elle a pas ouvert les yeuz'
Dans cette vie sans coloris, les cuisses endolories
Plongée dans ses pensées colériques, elle danse et colle au rythme
Y'a pas grand chose à faire pour cisailler l'ennui
À part prendre un taxi et aller en ville
Elle dansera jusqu'à 6, longue nuit
Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie

Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Au moins, elle est en vie

Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Elle danse comme si elle en avait envie
Au moins, elle est en vie

Elle danse dans une boîte dans les bas-fonds
Les mecs la matent, elle en a marre de ces blards-fon
Elle vient d'en bas, ça se bat, rien qu'elle a les marges
Elle a le moral dans les talons et les mains vers le plafond
Dans le carré, les mecs se la donnent
La boîte passe une track de mon album
Autour du mac, les michtos slaloment
À la ceinture et sur la table, il a le Magnum
Il disait s'appeler Malcolm
Il était dans le X
Il tisait son propre alcool
Il sait que les gens le fixent
Dans les vapeurs d'absinthe, loin des lopes-sa
Il observe cette fille absente qui l'obsède
Il lui a dit ""Je veux tout savoir, viens t'asseoir un peu
C'est mieux de recevoir un verre que recevoir un bleu""

Je l'ai jamais revu, pourtant j'y pense tous les soirs
Bourrés parce qu'on fête nos victoires en buvant
J'aurais voulu lui dire ""Faut que tu prennes hyper soin de toi""
Mon équipe se bouge le cul mais personne twerke, han
Tu sais, ma drogue, c'est les grandes scènes
Je suis toujours là pour mettre mon grain d'sel
Le ciel a plus d'étoiles que le drapeau américain
Et les étoiles n'ont pas l'air plus grandes du haut des gratte-ciels

Nekfeu,"Marre d'être déprimé, Seigneur, m'entends-tu?
Je me détruis même au détriment de mon art
J'aimerais agir autrement, suffit d'un rien
Peut-être une main tendue, rare
De voir un être humain être humain, ça m'choque
Il paraît que c'est normal, est-ce que c'est moi?
Je me rendais même pas compte
Que je vous faisais du mal, excusez-moi
Ils ont jeté mon père de son travail comme un malpropre
L'avenir de ma famille dépend sûrement de mon album
Faut que je sois là pour ma petite sœur, elle est inquiète
J'ai appris qu'être un grand frère
C'est pas juste taper ceux qui l'embêtent
C'est pas juste, je suis tiraillé entre mes envolées lyriques
Que peu comprennent, ces problèmes de fric qui me contraignent
Envers ma famille, mon âme est pleine de dettes
Papa n'a jamais demandé de l'aide
Il a géré les crises d'une main de maître
Et quand maman était enceinte de moi
Je lui mettais des coups dans le ventre
Je lui ai fait du mal avant même de naître

Please forgive me
While we're apart
I'm doing all of this for you
Keep holding on making true
And now that we have gone this far
Wasn't it that we changed the truth
The only thing I need is you

J'essaye d'éduquer ma peur, parfois j'étouffe
Il n'y a que Le Créateur qui s'est fait tout seul
Quand est-ce qu'on stoppe? Il n'y a plus de chaleur
Laisse-moi t'accoster deux secondes, ça vient du cœur
T'écoute mon rap au stéthoscope, mon shrab est père
Et je suis tellement fier, j'suis loin d'être mafieux
Mais j'agirai comme un parrain si tu touches à ma filleule
En amour, j'suis hyper sauvage, tout est vrai dans cet album
J'ai juste mélangé quelques histoires et changé les personnages
On est qu'une infime parcelle, ressens-tu l'inertie?
Peu importe qui j'suis, mes paroles sont universelles
Et toi qui craches sur moi
Si tu m'connaissais, j'suis sûr qu'on serait potes
Je t'en veux pas, j'aurais peut-être
Fait comme toi contre un mec comme moi, à l'époque
Avant, je voulais me prouver des trucs
J'avais peur donc j'voulais me battre
Depuis que j'ai frôlé la mort
J'ai plus peur d'rien et j'veux plus m'battre
J'fournis les graines, j'me dis qu'mon large public peut les semer
La vie est courte, les années passent plus vite que les semaines

Si je peux le faire, t'en es capable
Nan, je ne suis pas un mec à part
Nan, je ne vis pas dans un bête d'appart'
Ne te fie pas à ma tête à claque
Et les gens m'voyaient déjà
Noyé, ils me croyaient même pas
J'ai la peau pâle mais j'aime partager
L'mafé au foyer, des fois, tu croyais quoi?
Et puis pipelette, moi, je vois les hommes comme la sape
J'essaye et j'enlève l'étiquette si j'estime qu'ils sont à ma taille
Et j'le paye parfois, les gens n'sont pas ceux que l'on croit, en-soi
Le sérum d'amour, c'est l'genre de boisson que l'on boit sans soif
J'en bois cent boîtes, ondulation de la population
Ils ont trop bu en s'en lassant, copulation, ovulation
Aucune action n'est sans conséquence
Mais certains accidents sont bénéfiques
Regarde ton nombril avant d'enfoncer les filles
Dis à ceux qui te jugent que c'est juste un vice de plus
J'ai plus d'amour pour les salopes que pour tous ces fils de pute
Je revois rayonner les contours de tes cheveux auréolés
Le soleil, j'suis désolé pour tous ceux qui t'ont ri au nez
Je sais que c'est dur d'se sentir vivant
Dans cette noirceur étouffante, toi et moi
En vision infrarouge, on ressemble à des fantômes
Pardon aux gens que j'aime que j'ai plus l'temps d'voir

Please forgive me
While we're apart
I'm doing all of this for you
Keep holding on making true
And now that we have gone this far
Wasn't it that we changed the truth
The only thing I need is you

Je ressens toujours de la mélancolie sur les quais d'la gare
Je repense aux vacances d'été de la CAF
Depuis, j'ai vécu des choses, des expériences avec la came
Et la musique qui m'a sauvé
Rien de plus précieux que les clés d'la cave
Tu veux cher-tou que des chèques, man
C'est le Sheitan qui t'achète l'âme
Chaque fois que tu jettes l'arme dans la chette-ca que t'as chez toi
Chacun ses addictions, les moins que rien se multiplient
Ils veulent se soustraire à ma division dès qu'il faut payer l'addition
On traite nos corps comme des déchetteries
Consomme la mort en s'disant qu'on va pas s'empêcher d'vivre
Et j'y ai pensé la tête dans les toilettes
T'es un esclave quand t'es plus maître de toi-même
À l'heure où j'écris ça, j'ai arrêté d'fumer et d'boire
J'ai arrêté, mon Dieu, pourvu que ça dure
Je me sens tellement mieux
Ouais, j'ai arrêté, mon Dieu

Déçu de ceux qui rampent, on veut de la soupe, il faut des sous qui rentrent
C'est le souk, je veux pas d'une zouz exubérante qui zouke
Sinon, je devrais couper le souffle aux soupirants
Ils me supplieront de les épargner mais je suis pas économe
Hey, connards, laissez parler les vrais bonhommes
Tu sais, tant qu'un frère a du cœur, j'ai rien à foutre de ses stats'
On a passé le stade de se demander qui sait se tape
On s'estime et les doutes s'estompent

Au fond du trou, à part le Ciel, tu veux que je me tourne vers qui?
Envie de repartir à zéro comme un converti
Le traître négocie les trêves, le journaliste grossit les traits
Comme un coké, que connaît-il de la philosophie des gosses illettrés?
Sait-il ce qu'il se passe chaque fois qu'un petit se fait renvoyer?
Connaît-il la souffrance de l'enfance de mes petites sœurs en foyer?
Comme mon homonyme, des cicatrices, j'en ai bezef
Même avec les cordes vocales coupées, je serai un mec de parole
Je me retourne dans mon lit en me demandant si je dois les baiser
Vu que la nuit porte conseil, je me lève avec le barreau

J'suis prêt à les ken, t'as ma role-pa

Je me sens hypocrite, je plonge dans les tentations volontairement
Un péché en plus, un billet en moins
Je tue doucement la concurrence, tous habillés en noir
On n'a pas le temps d'attendre ton enterrement
J'pense à ceux qu'on s'est mis à dos, j'vois mon seum s'émietter
C'est mieux de s'aimer que sortir le semi-auto
On est tous responsables, en partie, du monde que l'on bâtit
L'égoïsme et le manque d'empathie, tout le monde en pâtit
C'qu'on vole, on le reperd, de quoi tomber pour recel dans le repère
Dans la jungle urbaine, sous tenue camouflage pour qu'on me repère
J'ai percé en indé', j'suis frais
C'monde est régi par des chiffres et, pour comprendre, faut déchiffrer
Ton patron t'a jeté, tu galères pour t'acheter
Les nouvelles paires en étant berné par les reportages télé
Tu vis dans un monde où l'État peut te piller ou t'épier
T'as pigé : en regardant un dollar, garde un œil sur tes billets
J'suis comme Broly, j'deviens paro dès que ça parle de carotte
Pour un taro exceptionnel, un type peut te sectionner la carotide
Direct au cimetière, y'a pas de sous-métier, sauf flic

Devant les boîtes, ça t'humilie, hein
T'inquiète, on a de la sensimelia
On a même du Saint-Emilion
Je rêve que du ciel étoilé, pas de rave dans les toilettes
Mets-toi raide dans des touaregs
Mets-toi raide dans les beurettes
Ce petit jeu n'a pas de sens, obligé d'en venir au cul
Elles me font des avances, je prends du recul

I see the stars baby
We gonna get away, you gonna lead the way
Lost in the night
Living in yesterday, I wanna rule now
Wake up and we get drunk
Don’t wanna leave this cold night
You gonna keep up
We gonna leave here faded

Désormais convaincu des lacunes qu'on véhicule

Cacher tes pensées trashs et cracher ce que t'as dans la trachée
Plusieurs trajectoires, tu peux recevoir une dragée pendant le trajet
En un clin d’œil car la mort est complice
Une vie qu'on bâcle, un deuil

Vu ce qu'on a partagé, jamais j'insulterai tes parents
Oui, ça m'affecte, tu verras ça avec Dieu
Ce monde est défectueux pour un homme affectueux

L'enfer est gelé, le paradis crame
Tout le monde rêve de planer, t'as pas de mal à bicrave
Tu déballes et voilà dix grammes, tu prends tes tunes, pas d'études
Mais tu passes ton premier examen pour une maladie grave
Je vois mon pote obligé d'se priver, les joues creusées
T'as deux choix : accepter leur privilège ou crever
La dèche, ouais, moi, je l'ai connue et je l'ai déjouée
Tous les doutes, je les tèj, ouais, c'est hors de question d'échouer
Sincèrement, j'en fais le serment
Je vais combattre le système en m'en servant
Leur âme est souillée comme l'air de la terre
Mais que puis-je changer sans faire d'affaires?
Il faut faire des sous, c'est le nerf de la guerre
Pour monter des assauts et rendre fière ma mère
Avant que Lucifer ne me crucifie
Je me suis laissé faire et j'ai cru ses fils
Cette fille à mes pieds, j'me méfie d'elle

À qui tu donnes de l'épaule pour t'en sortir?
Ici, tout le monde joue des rôles en rêvant du million d'euros
Et j'ai poussé comme une rose parmi les orties

J'éduque ma peine en leur parlant de nous
Je décuple mes sens comme un handicapé
Comment trouver le chemin qu'on m'indique à peine?
J'me sens comme Andy Kaufman dans Man on the Moon

« Ceux qui ont pris tout le plat dans leur assiette
Laissant les assiettes des autres vides et qui, ayant tout
Disent, avec une bonne figure, une bonne conscience
""Nous, nous qui avons tout, on est pour la paix!""
Tu sais c'que j'dois leur crier, à ceux-là?
""Les premiers violents, les provocateurs de toute violence, c'est vous!
Et quand, le soir, dans vos belles maisons
Vous allez embrasser vos p'tits enfants, avec votre bonne conscience
Au regard de Dieu
Vous avez probablement plus de sang sur vos mains d'inconscients
Que n'en aura jamais le désespéré qui a pris des armes
Pour essayer de sortir de son désespoir"". »","Nique les Clones, Pt. II"
Nekfeu,"On sèche les cours, la flemme marque le quotidien
Être en couple, ça fait mal que quand t'y tiens
Même si j'ai rien à prouver, j'me sens un peu seul
J'ai toujours pas trouvé la pièce manquante du puzzle
En possession d'drogues, les jeunes sont fêtards
Quelle ironie d'mourir en position fœtale
Je viens à peine de naitre, demain j'serai vieux
Mais j'vais tout faire pour être à jamais ce rêveur

On verra bien ce que l'avenir nous réservera
On verra bien, vas-y, viens, on n'y pense pas

Ce soir, on ira faire un tour chez l'épicier ouvert en bas
Et on parlera d'amour, entassés sur une véranda
Élevé par une vraie ronne-da, j'ai des valeurs qu'ils verront pas
Être un homme ça prend du temps
Comme commander un verre en boîte
J'ai l'vertige quand j'pense à toute la route
Qu'il me reste à accomplir
J'suis prêt à t'casser les couilles si t'as bu
J'te laisserai pas conduire
Le temps ça file, on a peur d’enchaîner les défaites et puis rater
Sa vie, pas de projets à part mater des DVD piratés
Ah, on verra bien
Ce monde rend fou, tout le monde est en guerre
Plus on s'renfloue et moins on voit clair
Quand t'as pas d'argent, dans ce monde, t'as pas d'droit
Y'a ceux qui cassent un tête et ceux qui tapent à trois
Combien d'fois j'ai volé par flemme de faire la queue?
Mon papa m'croit pas, mes sappes sentent le tabac froid
On s'fait chier au taff, on attend les cances-va
On s'parle derrière un ordi mais, en vrai, quand est-ce qu'on s'voit?

Mais quand y'a un gros ceau-mor ça rapplique
N'aie pas peur des insultes qu'on se lance
Aux consonances arabiques
On est tous dans le même bateau

J'ai pas le sang chaud, j'ai le sang froid comme si j'étais mort
Moi, je fais partie des gens qui restent chez eux

Allez tous balayer devant chez vous
Vous êtes dans la matrice, débranchez-vous
Les amatrices, déhanchez-vous
Et toi (moi?) je suis contre leurs lois
Je pars loin quand je vois les contrôleurs

Amène du shit, on voyage sans ticket
Je suis ce chic type anti-guerre qui chine plus qu'un antiquaire
Les samples sont diggués, le flow semble impossible à endiguer
Wesh, ça dit quoi? Le chemin n'est pas indiqué
Mais mon syndicat sait dédicacer le son des caves
Je danse seul avec mes écouteurs en club, club
Je ne fais pas partie de ceux qu'ont beaucoup de rancœur
Mais y'a certains combats que je préfère mener seul

J'ai l'esprit et le corps pollué, je vois que de la buée, des corbeaux
Je pratique la danse des cordes vocales
Il s'agit de s'enrichir dans ce décor pauvre
On regarde mais on a la flemme de voir
Le navire coule et ils disent qu'c'est un problème de voile
Pour celles qui m'avaient eu, je dépense, je taffe et j'tue
Celui qui veut que j'chois est mort à l'état de fœtus
La vie, un casino, laisse personne mélanger ton jeu de cartes

Je dirai à mon fils ""faut éviter le hall, garde tes mains clean
Paie-moi une tombe inclinée, je dois garder la tête haute""

Que ferais-tu une fois devenu le roi?
La question est ouverte sept sur sept
Je sais même pas qui je suis mais ce qui est sûr
C'est que je ressemble pas à celui que je vois devant le miroir
Je demande à la poussière comme John Fante
Jeune enfanté dans le désert, je bois dans chaque fontaine
Parmi les zonards qui font de la 'zique
Naturaliste comme Zola, rattrapé par le fantastique
Le cordon de la capuche serré, parfois, je me surprends
À penser comme un bandit, influencé par ma bande
Je sais très bien que je ne ferai aucun cambriolage
Mais j'ai des valeurs que je ne céderai pour aucun prix aux lâches
Incompris comme un Roumain blessé dans son estime
Je vois ma vie comme un roman
J'essaye de soigner le style et je veux le titre

Tes adversaires défilent et
J'aime tes collants effilés
Te compare pas à des filles laides
Même à l'école, t'es populaire comme t'es
Tu comptes plus les compliments récoltés
Et, dans tes soirées, y'a du monde au balcon
Mais je ne parle pas de ton décolleté
Je suis un mec à part, on vient pas de la même dimension
J'essaye de mener ma barque et, toi, tu me parles d'immenses yachts
Je côtoie des filles de mon âge et puis des filles âgées
Mais, même en amour, je vois peu de défis
Tellement de vautours, la durée de vie s'achète
Tout le monde autour semble me dévisager

Tu vas de boutique en boutique Antik Batik
Mais t'es qu'une enfant qui déguise sa peine
Ton visage angélique change quand tu mélanges des liqueurs
C'est étrange mais ton géniteur pense plus à ses enjoliveurs
Ta maman s'égosille chaque fois qu'tu te bousilles
T'as encore abusé hier

Comme si t'aimais qu'on t'fasse du mal, tu ne les arrêtais plus
Une petite princesse ne devrait pas devenir la reine des putes
Un ange passe, les ailes déployées
Moment de flottement
Rappelle-toi comme t'y croyais fort
Avant qu'le premier homme te mente
Tu t'es ouvert les poignets à cause d'un autre avortement
Tes marques peuvent en témoigner
Toi, t'es comme une môme, les mots te manquent
Tu fais aucun effort
Tu veux plus craquer chaque homme charmé
Par ton caractère se contentera de regarder
Ton cœur est un coffre-fort
T'as dû t'armer, te cacher derrière un masque
Et passer ton temps à te braquer
T'es plus la même qu'autrefois (ié-ié-ié)

Des urgences, des mariages, des naissances
Des procès, des nuits blanches et des micro-siestes

Et rien ne vaut le sentiment de vivre sereinement
La vie n'est qu'une escale, et ton corps n'est qu'un emprunt
Tu te plains, mais penses à la mort parce qu'elle est encore pire
Grosse galère, on escaladait les grilles des immeubles
Afin de s'caler dans les cages d'escaliers pour dormir
On était ensemble pour la mettre à l'envers dans tous les endroits

À ma mort, je n'aurai rien, je veux être celui qu'a pu donner
J'ai fui leur vision maussade pour rejoindre les hommes sages
Les pieds enfouis sous le sable, je peux dormir sur mon sac
Sans un sous en poche, on trouve le moyen d'se laver quand même
J'aime vagabonder, j'me sens meilleur quand j'suis seul avec moi-même
J'ai emporté toute sorte de paquetage, j'ai fait du stop

Pour séduire les filles, tout peut marcher sauf être un garçon bien
Évidemment, la vie d'amant me fait l'effet d'un vide en moi
Suffit d'un manque, et mes envies démentes dévient vers les filles d'avant
Je vois se succéder les flirts
Cette fille que j'embrasse a du noir sur la joue
Elle m'a dit ""C'est pas ce que tu crois, c'est à cause du froid.""
Mais j'ai su que c'était des pleurs
Je n'étais pas investi, donc efface tes larmes
On était tous les deux paumés
Tu m'avais dans la peau mais je ne faisais que l'effleurer
De la paume, et mes désirs m'ont dévasté l'âme
J'ai déjà connu les débuts d'un amour puéril
Je n'avais pas l'intention de te mettre la bague au doigt
De toutes façons, je côtoie d'autres mecs, y'a pas que toi

Même à se tatouer la tête de Marine Le Pen
Sur les fesses pour que je lui claque très fort
Elle m'a dit ""Ken, je rêverais d'être ta chienne""
Je l'ai menotté de manière détachée
Elle m'appelle au téléphone et me dit ""Viens me peloter.""
Je lui dis ""Garde tes talons mais, ta robe, tu peux l'ôter.""
Il est déjà tard quand je décale du bel hôtel
Toujours le même schéma, désir, pulsion

Des relations qui ne me mènent nulle part

Attendent que je tende mon piège

Monté de colère quand elle m'a dit que son nouveau mec l'avait cogné
Alors j'ai appelé ce fils de pute, j'ai tapé ce fils de pute
Mais après quelques disputes, elle a rappelé ce fils de pute
Ah, phénomène anormal
L'amour, le sérum et le venin, vu qu'on aime avoir mal
Quant à elle, elle est mortelle
Dans mon cœur, c'est le déferlement
Elle ne me donne pas trop de nouvelles
Alors c'est dur de faire le mort
Y'a que quand elle a bu des cocktails
Qu'elle m'appelle, du genre ""T'es là?""
Dîner au chandelle, elle m'attend déjà au tel-hô

Au début, ça vend du rêve mais seules les femmes savent endurer
Et chaque fois que ça compte, je n'arrive pas à être moi-même
D'où vient ce besoin de vouloir tout cacher?
Aucune fille ne compte, et puis je t'ai rencontré, toi
T'étais différente, ça m'a fait peur, j'ai tout gâché
On faisait la paire, on était perchés
Si je la perds, je l'aurais cherché

C'est l'hécatombe qu'importe le réel
Vu qu'c'est Dieu qu'emporte le rêve
Mon Seigneur c'est pour ça qu'on t'implorait
J'vois les restes de bons sentiments
Dans mon cœur incorporés
Emportés par un corbeau, incarné par ton corps
J'pourrai encore pleurer
Mais j'suis plus qu'un missile téléguidé
Que t'as armé quand t'as décidé d'me quitter
J'sais plus qui t'es, pourtant c'est
Entièrement de ma faute, t'as tout faux
Si tu crois qu'les garçons vont en boite pour danser

Quand faut se dépêcher, parmi ceux qu'on fait céder
Combien veulent confesser des pêchés?
J'ai prédit qu'certains s'aideraient d'un psy hin

Aucune affaire conclue avec les lâches
Ceux qu'on eu quand j'avais rien
À part l'amour d'mes galériens, ceux qu'on hue, avec des « H »
Seul dans ma hutte, les yeux sur mon avenue
Je pense à tout ceux qu'ils ont eu
La roue tourne plus, y'a sûrement un U
Je pense à toi mon frère qu'a épousé ta plume
Dépoussiéré ton armure et repoussé la brume
Liquide nocif dans ta Cristalline dès que la crise t'abime
Et quand t'écris ces lignes
Des étoiles qui s'alignent hors de ta chrysalide
Bénie soit celle qui embellit ton ciel
Même dans l'horreur pénitentiaire
Quand tes erreurs pénibles t'encerclent
Et quand le mal t'ensert
T'as une femme sincère t'en es maintenant certain
Car dans tes yeux les flammes dansèrent
Force à toi si t'as épousé ta plume
Si c'est la seule qui t'a plu
Si vos chemins n'se quittent plus

Moi elle m'absorbe comme la goutte d'encre sur laquelle j'mets l'accent

Mon verre de rhum et j'chanterai
À la gloire des femmes aux robes échancrées
Y'en a certaines que j'oublie vite, et je fuis comme un lâche
Mais toi t'es parti en m'laissant blanc comme un linge face au lit vide
Si tu laisses la flamme mourir, je mourrai d'abord
N'oublie pas que le pardon se nourrit d'aveux
D'un œil accusateur, tous les passants scrutent nos disputes
Mais, ça ne les regarde pas, l'amour est aveugle
Rien d'plus dangereux qu'une fille au cœur brisé
Mais ta haine c'est ma seule lumière dans ce tunnel
Car si tu m'détestes c'est qu'tu m'aimes
J't'ai pas laissé de répit, en apparence
Tu t'es épris d'un autre que moi pour me détruire
Tu m'annonces que ton cœur est pris et puis
On fait l'amour, tu trouves ça maléfique et dément
Et ton amant étonnamment est plus magnétique qu'un mari aimant

Yeah yeah, j'vois mes soss dans l'ciel

Pour eux, on va transformer Seine Zoo en grosse enseigne
Fini de passer des journées à fumer l'hollandaise

Question d'honneur

Fais pas d'menace, j'te regarde mal, j'ai pas de masque
J'aime le rap de Pac' et pas de Nas
Pas d'place pour l'faux rap
T'as besoin d'une dou'a
Tu veux ber-bar, on t'aura avec une balle dans l'thorax
On pense aller au large donc on fonce
Réussite du 15 comme Alphonse Aréola
Tu prends un aller simple, on a les armes
Faut ber-bar mais pas les shabs
Les excuses n'excusent pas les actes
Nous on séduit vite, tu gères rien du tout
T'es comme Cell, les meufs fuient ta queue comme C-18
T'as pas d'départ, t'as trop d'humeurs
T'as plus d'déclin de vœux, ta foi est triste
J'ai pas d'DA, pas d'producteur
J'emprunte les chemins que j'veux, la voie est libre

Le peuple est endetté mais ceux qui gèrent les banques y s'font
Des couilles en or sur ta tête pendant que la banquise fond
Éparpillés sur l'avenue, ça y est on y est parvenus
Bienvenu aux nouveaux venus mais les groupies c'est farfelu
Tous ces clones, écartez-les, surtout quand ça parle de rap
Faut arracher l'cro-mi des faux chroniqueurs télé
T'as vu l'atmosphère qu'on s'prend? Obsédés par les morts
C'est comme si on parlait morse vu qu'on tape pour s'faire comprendre
Sur l'amour tire un trait, j'te fais pas de dessin
Mon cœur, pas facile d'y rentrer, surtout qu'en bas y'a les zins
La vie, un voyage compliqué, pourtant y'a qu'un aller simple
C'est pas net, j'me sens comme un humain sur la Planète des singes

Rien qu'on parle de TMAX, plan schneck
J'laisse personne me marcher dessus
Comme une paire de Air Max blanches neuves
Wesh, Nek! me disent les petits ""c'que t'as tu le mérites""
Y'en a très peu qui représentent bien le Paris méridional
15ème, 13ème, 14ème, ici aussi
Tu trouves des mecs à l'ancienne et des canons sciés
J'suis loin des caïds qui bicravent le crack des gués-dro
Mais dans mon crâne c'est plus crade que le plus crade des ghettos
J'me fous d'ton palmarès si tu sais pas rimer
C'est Paris même mais c'est pas l'Marais
Le 15 abrite de très grands bat' où y'a qu'le shit qui crée de l'emploi
J'fais comme les flics je mets la lumière
Sur mon équipe qui traîne en bas
Vu la taille du gâteau normal qu'on veuille le grignoter
J'bosse la nuit, impossible d'empêcher mon œil de clignoter
Du sang dans les prunelles, besoin d'être défoncé
Dès que t'as mal, t'effrites le kétama sans même le brûler
J'aime les films truffés d'héroïnes, putes, flingues et fédéraux
L'argent part en fumée
Car y'a que quand j'bédave que j'fais des ronds
Pour certains j'ai la tête du premier d'la classe
Mais mon cœur bat pour les reniés de l'Atlas
Et tous ces mecs cheums ils peuvent que tailler mes cheveux
Mais, messieurs, ne me confondez pas avec ces mécheux
J'ai appris à me servir des apparences
Faut qu'on maille, certains de mes reuftons sont déjà parents
On est soudés comme les Lyonnais
Les traîtres, man, on les traite mal
On est venu te montrer qui on est
T'inquiète, on fera du biff avec les sons qu'on maquettera
J'en ai pris des patates dans l'pif mais personne m'a quette-ra

Ils ont essayé pourtant, hein, si tu savais
J'étais mineur quand j'me suis retrouvé dans ce milieu d'requins
J'ai tout eu ma parole, les menaces à la famille
Les voitures en bas d'chez moi mais j'suis toujours là grâce à Dieu

Jamais trompé par l'étroitesse d'esprit, je t'explique
Ils aiment tellement le fric qu'ils veulent me mettre en pièces
Mais mon détournement d'son
Est conçu pour durer entre deux mondes
Qu'est-ce qui fait marcher les sages?
On t'redemande, y'a trop de mensonges
Tout ça m'inquiète, t'sais
J'suis sur Paris, j'attends d'reprendre la route
Comme une péniche sur les quais d'Seine
Mental d'indigène, anti-chienne
Mais je brise le cœur des gentilles filles dont j'me suis entiché
Il est déjà tôt mais, gros, j'suis toujours dans les griffes acérées
D'un plan cul avec qui j'ai des atomes crochus
Mon gars, elle m'a dit ""Occupe-toi de mon cas""
Vu qu'elle sentait la mangue
Je l'ai prise par derrière comme un manga
Des mecs, elle en ramène plein dans l'mois
Bébé, tu veux un baise-main? Branle-moi!
Je rêve d'une meuf fine qui me file des muffins
Mais je me fie qu'à moi-même car ma vie est un me-fil
Je me méfie et j'me-fu, hey, tu connais

Je vois les signes mais je suis pas sûr de leur interprétation
Range-toi, la routine m'ordonnait ça

It's only made of short stories

Guided by electric wires' hum

People they laugh when they hear you're from my town
They say it's a sour and used up all place
I defended its honor, shrugged off the put downs
You know that you're poor, from Tacoma

Buildings are empty like ghettos or ghost-towns
It gives me a chill to think what was inside
I can't seem to fathom the dark of my history
I invented my own in Tacoma

There was nothing to put me in love with the good life
I'm in league with the the gangs guns, and the crime
There was no hollow promise that life would reward you
There was nowhere to hide in Tacoma

People who built it they loved it like I do
There was hope in the trainyard of something inspired
Once was I on it, but it's been painted shut
I found passion for life in Tacoma

Has withered and gone

And out in the darkness

Please hold to my hand
Oh please understand

Where has she gone to
Oh where can she be
She may have forsaken
Some other like me

She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away

Salty tentacles drink in the sun but the red tide is over

When the match made them sweet
When the engine turned over and beat up our street

To remember

I remember because of the fires that leapt
From the caves of the things that have not happened yet

Nellie Lutcher,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Nellie Lutcher,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

Nellie Lutcher,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

And I found with the break of dawn

Nellie McKay,"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love",The Very Thought of You
Nellie McKay,"I expect everyone of my crowd to make fun
Of my proud protestations of faith in romance
And they'll say I'm naive as a babe to believe
Every fable I hear from a person in pants

Fearlessly I'll face them and argue their doubts away
Loudly I'll sing about flowers in spring
Flatly I'll stand on my little flat feet and say
Love is a grand and a beautiful thing

I'm not ashamed to reveal
The world famous feeling I feel

I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl with no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy

I am in a conventional dither
With a conventional star in my eye
And you will note there's a lump in my throat
When I speak of that wonderful guy

I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May
A cliche coming true
I'm bromidic and bright
As a moon-happy night
Pouring light on the dew

I'm as corny as Kansas in August
High as a flag on the Fourth of July
If you'll excuse an expression I use
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy",Wonderful Guy

More and more I miss her, when will I learn
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone

Now they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching
Just another, hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
'cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take green

Or push a candy colored cutless wit a matchin' G Shock

This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues

(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill

Me and E getting solid like the ice capades
From heat, frosty, roger the rabbit than bugsy
You understand me, wrapped crisp like mummys

If you compare me to your local grocery
Then you'll see I got more carrots than aisle d
More bread than aisle e, you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al be	, you can meet tha 'tics in Maui (hey)

You know this and these cats hate it
I got nuttin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded
S-class wit everything voice-activated
Chrome rims three bladed, factory custom made it
Paid wit big faces; if it's broke then replace it
Now it's like that; Purple Haze and Cognac
On the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back

I represent them street niggas
When they get hot, carry the heat niggas
Them sweet niggas off they feet niggas
You livin' on the edge, fleet nigga
That's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga
Ain't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes
Ready to represent the Grove wit two calicoes

You don't make out alive very often up in here
I'mma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna
I'm a sweep off ya air if its any beef partna
I skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna
Slip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers
Weezy-wez partna

Four karats in my earring, five around my knuckle
Six wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle
Leave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know
If you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so
Somebody gotta shine my nigga why not me
Even my dentist told me floss 7 days a week
Freeza burnt out the piece, Gucci, and hat, sneaks

Nelly,"I, opened up shop at 13
Dimes, dubs, quarter sacks and O-Z's
From hand-held, digital to triple-beam
Now my pa-ger's an e-mail flip screen
Expanded my game off into amphetamines
Looked around and had a small Wallgreens
Put tha word out on tha street, don't you fuck wit my fiends
Them niggas around tha corner, come let tha thing beam
Now they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching
Just another, hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
'Cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take green
I might ride tha Range wit tha Roley on the rocks
Or push a candy colored cutless wit a matchin G-Shock
When the, spot get hot don't stop, move shop
Find another block restock and take it from the top now

Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do

So you think you're the shit nigga, ya smell me?
Shouts out to my nigga NORE
I'll never take another man's glory
Shit don't mix like Shaq and Kobe
Now you know me, I be low key
On these icey Roleys, dude that showed me
And hoes ignored me, now they blow me
Them niggas that loaned me, now they owe me
Oh me, oh my I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes
Now call me a lie
While you fly, stand by, I stand by tha captain
Hoe play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin' higha than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin'
Now Lester called me a heathen old fish eyed fool
Bitch had the nerve to repeat old fish eyed fool

""Yeah son, where the gun?"" It's at home wit tha dope
""Oh you a smart ass ha?"" Nah that's my lil joke
""How bout I tow yo truck in?"" Ain't no need to be provoked
Besides everything up in here done been smoked
I ain't got nuttin' but tapes and CDs
Pocket full of G's and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees
Ain't no more questions then hand me my ID
You could tell he was pissed
'Cause the black man in the black Range
Doin' black things wit his black change
Doin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane

Nelly,"Yo, hey Nelly what's up dog? It's Cedric the entertainer get at me man
I been hollerin' at you man.
I been tryin' to call you 'bout 3 days
I called your cell phone, your pager, your voice mail, over you mamma house.
Your uncle Daryl and I paged Kewan like 3 time,
Ya'll get at me man I just want to holler at
You player, you know I'm out here in Cali just doin it up,
Hangin' out here you know chillin'
Tryin' to do a little tv, you know how I do it,
Rollin' around here in a big body Benz with 2 dollar worth of gas,
Huh who said there wasn't no future in your front
Put it down like dat wit that country grammer right,
I heard about it
Using them words like St. Louis, ""hurr"" ""thurr"" puttin'
Them two capital ""R"" on everything
I feel you on that right, I feel you so just get at me,
So I can do a little something for you
Flip a few things, just call me back what ever,
You can't get me, call on my mammas house
They know how to page me, they'll page me to your number
Then I'll call you back or you can just page my cousin Keith
And he'll call my cousin lil Daryl
Who got my real pager number and then I call you back
On his cell phone, what ever you do player, do it St.Louis style.
Put it down for the STL aight
Now get at me",Intro
Nelly,"Ayo ma, how you doin'?
It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya
Ain't nothin' I can do when them laws get they hands on you
But I ain't listenin', even payin' attention
I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage of you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send you props cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)
On your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, cause you're my boo and my only one
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

Mercedes dyke
On a shady night
Y'all niggas is lady like
Roll with niggas that'll watch your arm
Run in your crib pop your Mom
Like, ""bitch, where the stocks and bonds?""
In the studio, you thug wanna block your calm
Tell a nigga I'm like flex I drop the bomb
You come to war with a switch blade
Get laid
Nigga I'ma spit the gauge at your rib cage
We thugged out
Y'all niggas is bitch made
You picked yay, it ain't off white the shit grey
Your customers mad, ready to let the clips spray
Out of a week I stay in a lab for 6 days

I brought my right guard incase my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree
The secrets still kept
Never let em see you sweat

Bullets ricochet off the window
Through the head of your son
I've been runnin' like 20 miles
I ain't sweatin' for fun
Yo it's hard to be a team when the second is one
'Cause I follow very
Wanna wife like Halle Berry
Yeah I ain't trying be locked up under consolitary
How you gon' stop a nigga, unstoppable
How you gonna pop a nigga that pop for you
Hop out in the drop top, aqua blue
Got the bitch screamin' ""Please, Please, not my boo""
I'm far from shook, I deal with smart crooks
You know the name
Switch up the game like Garth Brooks
Like ten cars, from Tahoe's to Windstars
I been hardly helped, let it sing God
Diminish, I'm a bull dog, breathing British
You ain't side cause you nice yo it's all about your image

And Cutlass', check the ashtray that hold the blunts
We hustling, I do the push ups and the sit ups nigga
Get muscular, just in case you let your lips slip up
I'm busting ya, never let em see you sweat
Yeah that's my motto, catch em in the club get wrecked
With the bottle, upside his head behind his neck
The others follow
Show them ya'll ain't bullshitting and you ain't hollow
I saw you talkin' to that chick, off over there
I heard you ask her why she on my dick, yeah, yeah
I heard it all before ya dig
Next thing you telling me Nelly
I put that on my fucking kid
What you think this is
I'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system
So niggas can't find they trucks and they women when I'm with em
Like I catch em in linen
And then I flip em and run up in em
Send her back to him
And go to his house and blow him with her

I brought my right guard incase my shot ain't handy

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss

From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4

I rip grass and smash, with a 44 mag
This nigga jag, from the front to the back I heard it crash
Nigga you said you hurt 'em bad, you heard him laugh
Talkin' trash 'bout whoopin' my ass
I never let a nigga do that, who that
Get his brains blew back with a new gat
Yellin' ""true that"", hollowtips is goin' clean through that
And I didn't have to get my whole team just to do that
In a blue hat, with a black baggy Karl Kani
An iced out ring just to scar on your eye
Hard to die, like Bruce, Lee get a victory
Cats is sick like H-I-V if they feelin' weak
We be Nikki Sacks, Jackie Frost, Scratchy
Danny Terrio, Dutch Schultz, to the Motorola
Money hold up, whippin' the Rover, high roller dog
What you holdin', I'm paid, so controllin' y'all
Yiggidy yes y'all like Das EFX, I's be next
To rep that Midwest, it's sets and projects

Now once Keyaun say hit the safe, raise the stakes
'Tics in fifty states, might as well blaze the cake
I got moves to make, transactions to handshakes
Drugs for papes, now I'm sellin' CDs and tapes
Funerals and wakes caused by greed and hate
A snake is still a snake no matter the size or shape
Those that hate, anchored with weights, found in the lake
Come off the chain my main, you tied to the gate
First you caught a case, second you caught the babes
Third, you caught me with your date, that was no mistake
Good things come to those who wait
So if you waitin' on them 'Tics, huh, they gon' be late
In your house with your spouse I'm doin' the nasty
I'm a felon, ask Jay, I rob industries and ashtrays
Branson and hashy, add gas and wrap somethin'
And burn the place, ya heard me

Watch me load up the ammo, cock it back slow
In the back door, infrared low
Tell me somethin' that I don't already know
Like, which one of these closets contain cash flow
Got three little problems I just thought you should know
Peep, I'm addicted to 'yes' and I'm allergic to 'no'
I'm obsessed with dough, money makin' and the hoes
Anything other than satisfaction gon' blow
Heard through the grapevine you lookin' for me
Couldn't be, cause if it was you would be bookin' from me
Shook when ya see Nelly rollin' in the GS-3
Hangin' out the sunroof like ""bing, bing, bing""
Back the car up, pop the trunk now
Can ya hold ya breath cause I'mma flood this town
That ass scream ""nine-second-five right here""
Neighbors on the lawn like ""Nelly, why right here""

Call the cops, I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show
(Where you from?)
From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4

Nelly,"See now you could be a lady or a bitch girl
Still, your thicky thicky thicky thick
Looking like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' hit the switch girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Could it be a crime that I'm waitin' to commit girl?
Your thicky thicky thicky thick

So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When are you that shoes untied before you know it method
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's getting hectic
Wreck it just like a hoopty with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles
Twistin' and pulling
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile,
So I take advantage
Kissin' in gentle places trying to get myself established
I'm comfortable, want to be in that moe
With no control
Concentrating on my every lick, her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
It's on, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

See now you could be a lady or a bitch girl
Still, your thicky thicky thicky thick

Your thicky thicky thicky thick

Now I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt
Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far
From Average Lame with that ""What's your name?"" game
I'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin' me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now
We spreadin' on my homies like a germ
Watch me turn into captain kill a ho
Fill a ho strong
Watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons
Comin' out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, godamnit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin' action like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways
'75 sideways

See now you could be a lady or a bitch girl
Still, your thicky thicky thicky thick
Looking like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' hit the switch girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Could it be a crime that I'm waitin' to commit girl?
Your thicky thicky thicky thick

I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like hoop for Atlanta (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, hit any one of you niggas rat
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'
Go make the announcment, spark more Dynamite than ""Good Times""
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'
Got 'em bangin the walls so hard the neighbors callin'

Asking you ""What happened? What's goin on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin crazzzzzzzyy""

Your thicky thicky thicky thick

Nelly,"Uhh, I falls through in a Hummer, Murphy the Don, Lizzie, Keyuan
With the best thunder Sean John, you don't want none
Partner, I got a rep for leavin' heads swollen up
On top of all that, I got the rap sewed up
Hold up, with the budda thumpin' niggas quota
And just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder
I told ya, 'Tics live for the street life
Eat right, fuck good, and reffer thru the pipe
I'm gettin' head all night
And if it's some beef, I pumpin' lead on sight
Until they deceased
I took ya head off right
I live in the beast
Nigga, where the feds, play sheist
I still floss ice, keep it tight
E-very time, call me the Black Liberace when I'm playing mine
That's how I flow, I gotta get mine, partna, any way it go
Whether it be rapping or with the 4-4

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0

My nigga, I can make a million blind-folded, with no shows
Using no flows, just Arm-n-Hammer and four O's
Gimmie low-do's and a connect, that neva closed
And watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos
Fuck some Mo-Mo's, gimme hundred spokes, all chrome
On the Navigator equipped to click and log on
I need that before it's gone
'Fore they even bring it home
Matta fact, I'll tell you whats in the back, its all wrong
Two holes in the roof, to let the sun come in
Matching leather carseat, in case my son get in
I spare one off in the back in case he brings his friend
PlayStation just in case a nigga think he can win

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and hydro

Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

I say now, tho yo wrappers off in tha air
But only if the ice on your wrist cause glares
I'm gettin' stares from dime bitches, is he alone
Where's his Mrs., 1-2-3-4-5 bottles of Cris's
On the table, arms got straws they ripped off the labels
No more shows for free, I'm pay-per-view like cable
They all screamin' my name, different shades and race
Take them all backstage and lett'em plead they case
Make a million like Jigga, standin' in one place
Sound Scan like Thrilla with out changing my face
They threw a weak plan B says who? (says Mase)
Then what's plan A cause plan B about papes

Let's make a million

Nelly,"I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell

And let me take you to the other side

You don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

I said inhale, exhale
I heard your clientele is doing well
I see you booming out the S-T-L
Pushin' a five hundred S-L
I heard you even got a child now (look at that)
A baby momma and a bow-wow
My nigga know you need to calm down
'Bor County run up in your house
But you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late
Now the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait
They got taps on your mobile phone
They do surveillance all around your home
Now ya pawnin' everything ya own
Calling on your partners for a loan
No more slip and sliding on the chrome
Your good days have come and gone
I tried to tell you

Said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

I say baby girl what's your name?
And tell me what's your claim to fame
Oh I can tell you do your thing
Just by checking out your diamond ring
I see you at the mall every day
Buying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'
Plus I heard they took your job away
Ya got ya kids' shit on lay away
You got a 4-5 Infinity (You living large)
Like your last name was Kennedy or El DeBarge
Oh I just can't believe, that you made that money righteously
The kids asking what they mommy do
And why she lock us in our bedroom
I think mommy getting paid to screw
'Cause every night it's a different dude
I tried to tell

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell

So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

Little man how old are you (you can tell me)
And what you doing skipping school?
I see you running with your lil' crew
Out here fighting over red and blue
So now you wanna claim gangs
Even heard you bought a thumper man, and that ain't it
You started out with chronic on the brain
Now you're smoking amphetamines
I ain't trying to sell your dreams
Just trying to show you, that's it's other ways of getting cream
(Take it from me) Just go to school and make something of
Your young life and watch it blow up
And you ain't gotta stop being cool
And you ain't even gotta stop flossing fancy jewels (and fast cars)
Just keep it real with your game son
And don't forget were you came from
I'm trying to tell ya

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride

Nelly,"Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

You see Biggie be like ""What's Beef?""
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours like a prescription I'm smoke
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool ""J's"" I mean bud
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue, smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point ""A"" ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ya I get high
You might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors

You know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, wrap sumden (Wrap Sumden)
Make a nigga clap somthing, get all mad and slap somthing

Yo grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time
And I burn mine, don't you ever ever touch mine

Fire it up dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get blowed

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more
But since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though, I keep the pants saggy.
Bubble eye, hands waggy
Eyes glassy, smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
""What we doin' today"" Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Ok made a left you continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie

Hoe play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin' higha than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin'
Now Lester called me a heathen old fish eyed fool
Bitch had the nerve to repeat old fish eyed fool

Greed, hate, envy but cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game Fuck you now
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy but cake will do

One time out in the Range Rover
(Woop, woop, woop!) Aw shit they pulled me over
What tha hell y'all fuckin' wit me fo'?
Speed limit 30 just doin' 34
""Yeah son, where the gun?"" It's at home wit tha dope
""Oh you a smart ass ha?"" Nah that's my lil joke
""How bout I tow yo truck in?"" Ain't no need to be provoked
Besides everything up in here done been smoked
I ain't got nothin' but tapes and CD's
Pocket full of G's and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees
Ain't no more questions then hand me my ID
You could tell he was pissed
'Cause the black man in the black range
Doin' black things wit his black change
Doin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane
And if I wasn't in his face he probably be callin' me names

I'm waiting for the right time to shoot my steez you know
Waiting for the right time to flash them ki's, then 
I'm leaving, please believing, oh!
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I feeding
No deceiving, nothing up my sleeve and
No teasing I need you to
Get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he asking for

And I feel like touching you, uh uh
And can't nobody stop the juice

Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? c'mon
What good is all the fame if you ain't fucking the models
I see you driving, sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and ""Park""ed it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like ""Girl I think my butt getting big!""

Stop pacing, time wasting
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement what?
I'm just kidding like Jason oh
Unless you gon' do it

Came back with something thick and it fitting in sasoons
Say she got a thing about cutting in restrooms, oh

You better watch who you talkin bout, runnin your mouth, like you know me
You gon' fuck around and show why the ""Show Me"" get called the ""Show Me""
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France, but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats, total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compare this, my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola, no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin' I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin' and cryin suck it up as a loss
'Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am, number one, no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey

What does it take to be, number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)
What does it take to be, number one?

Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy?
Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say
What I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, Internet access some, website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin, ""Yo where the party?""
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know, PIMP

Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop
You know! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock

Taking nothin' for granted blessin' e'rything on my life
Tryin' to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak the truth
I heat the booth, Nelly actin' so uncouth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win dirty, dity

No matter if you like it, here take it sit down and write it

You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Every, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie want to signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find another
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated

Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? Me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend nigga I fuck twins
From the back end back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go
Iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
Bmw Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? Yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, ménage trois was civil
Crystal y'all, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar

When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throw up a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It's not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. To 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

Can't worry 'bout certain sounds

Help me out now one year get one carat, two years get two carats
Three years get three carats, and so on into marriage
Nobody livin' average, everybody jang-a-lang
Nobody livin' savage, e'rybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
It's not a game, it's a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks with no gunplay
Ain't nobody shot, so ain't no news that day
Ain't nobody snitchin', they refuse to say
Every month we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains, know how wet we want it to be
And if we vote it snow, know how deep we want it to get

You do unto others if you don't want it don't do the cappin'
Think that's cool? 40 Acres and a mule
Fuck that! Nellyville, 40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz'
Six-car garage, pavement smooth

Whether you sparkle or you bling, don't matter same thing
Thug drinkin mo', but Don the King
I'm gettin pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene

I love my fans to death
Until my last breath
That's why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same
Do they want the fame
And all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin collars from California to D.C
I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey
I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's
I'm flippin' out my keys, I'm flippin' down the screens
I'm bout to spread my wings
Tryin' to fulfill my dreams
With anything that I want, if I don't I got the means

You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't (you don't even know)
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself
So I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and the
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't (it really really don't)
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself
So I, I splurge a lil' hell

You think you know me but you really don't know
Me, if I could
Walk through the club like everything be fo sho
And I'll get
One lil' girl, two lil' girls  tryin yo get me to dance
I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls
Pullin' at my pants, damn
It feels good when errthing is okay
And it's a beautiful site when errthing goes your way
And I could park in the mountains and I'll still get valet
Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's
I'm feeling good it's only right I deserve
To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge
And any nigga trippin' now I leave him right by the curb
And I don't go to sleep mama so good night and to work
I'm on a mission and it's sort a like a mystery
And I ain't stopping 'til I go down in history, now
Who ever said you knows, you dealing with a PIMP fo sho
The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go

You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't (you don't even know)
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself
So I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and the
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't (it really really don't)
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself
So I, I splurge a lil' hell

You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene
Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being
I'm doing human things, 'cause only humans change
They label me a role model 'cause I appeal to teens
It really ain't this strange, now that I think about it
I came up in the game, changed everything about it
I'm feelin' better than ever without that lotto shit
I wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go buy some shit
You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips
We've got the baddest chicks (you know)
We with the whitest kicks
Donating money to family's caught in Bin Laden's shit
They screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship and
Bring it up that Mississipi
If you really wanna come than get me
Tell them niggas that a, don't tempt me
'Cause I'll squeeze them shits til' empty
Throw shouts at nigga like Frisbee
Who the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?
You niggas must be kidding me
Make an innocent nigga plead guilty

You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't (you don't even know)
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself
So I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and the
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't (it really really don't)

And check
Why they surely
They call me
""Show me""
Why one-on-one
You can't hold me
If your last name was Haynes
Only way you wear me out
Is stitch my name
On your pants
No resident of France
But you swear
I'm from Paris
One hundred and six carats
Told 'em
""Naw that's per wrist""
Trying to compurr
(Compare) This
My chain to your chain
I'm like sprint and Motorola
No service
Out of your range
You're out of your brains
Thinking I'ma
Shout out your name
You gotta come up
With better ways
Than that
To catch your fame
Only pressure you applying
Is time to ease off
Before I hit you
From the blind side
Taking your sleeves off
As much as we's lost
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lying, b****in'
And crying
Sucking the bezel loss
Cause you're
As* is wack
Your whole
Label is wack
And matter fact
Eh eh eh eh eh
Hear that

I-am-number one
No matter if you like it
Here take this sit down
And write it
I-am-number one
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Now let me ask you man
What does it take to
Be number one?
Two is not a winner
And three nobody remembers
(Hey)
What does it take
To be number one?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Do you like it when
I shake it for ya
Daddy
Move it all around
Let you get a peep before
It touches the ground?

Hell yeah
Ma I'm in a girl
That's willing to learn
Willing to get
In the driver's seat

Willing to turn
And not concerned about that
He say, she say, did he say
What I think he said?
Squash that
He probably got that off E-bay
Or some Internet access
Some website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine
Ooh don't wind up
On the flat line
Oh if my uncle
Could see me now
If he could see
How many rappers
want to be me now
Straight emulating my style
Right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now
Better wait till
They calm down
I got hella shorty's
Coming askin' me
""Yo where the party?""
Oh Lordy till
I continue to act naughty
Mixing Cris and Bacardi
Got me banging fo sho
I'm not a man of many words
But there's one thing I know
Pimp

[Chorus]

Hey yo I'm tired of people
Judging what's real hip-hop
Half the time you be them niggas
Who's f***ing album flop
(You know)
Boat done sank and
It ain't left the dock
(C'mon)
Mad 'cause I'm hot
(He just)
Mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta
Gimme my props
Just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks
Keep my fans
Coming in flocks
Till you top the Superbowl
Keep your mouth on lock
Sh I'm awake ha ha
I'm cocky on the mic
But I'm humble in real life
Taking nothing for granted
Blessing errthing on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Peep it, name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncouth
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreading the loot
With my
Family and friends
And my
Closest to kin
And I
Do it again
If it means I'ma win
Dirty I am

Hey Just, this the one right here baby
I told you dawg
Its be sig in the place with state P
And we got what it takes to rock the mic right yea
Still watch what you say to B.sig
'Cause I still will knock your ass the fuck out

I bring the hood when I'm travelin'
Scrap backwoods unravelin'
Scrap smoke good when we travelin'
Forget the Mac's cause the K's fit good in the caravan
I clap up your hood like the hammer man
Bring your gat, better bust it if you get that close
Scared to clap better strap your folks
(Strap your folks)
Who want beef with state P
Enemies try to speak to me
Negative they don't get that close

Its free, listen
Blow trees with mac mittens
(No we didn't)
Yes we did
(Switch beginnings)
Smith and Wesson precision
Bring the broads down with ribbons
(Leave a mess in your crib)
Not a brave nigga?
(Fuckin' with some made niggas)
Hit him with the AK nigga
(Free no you didn't)
Yes I did
Overpayed shit? Wait a minute
When this fakin, snatch the cake up out his crib
(Then slide, uh)
I'm like the baker with your pies
(Then rise)
Set up shop and distribute where you live
It's freeway in the place with my squad
And we got what it takes to dump the K
Flip your ride

Its be sig in the place with state P
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yea
Still watch what you say to young free
'Cause fifty shots still will turn the club out

Its freeway in the place with state P
And we got what it takes to the rock the mic right yea
Still watch what you say to be sig
'Cause we got what it takes to dump the D E

Its Nelly in the place with Murph Lee
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
(Yea)
You better watch what you say around here
'Cause there's somethin' on my waste to make the whole place break

Its Murph down in the place with Nelly
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yea
You better watch what you say to my face
'Cause I got what it takes to shake the whole place

Murphy Lee's eighteen entertainin 'em
Twenty one when I'm clubbin it
Fake ID for the fuck of it
I'm just a school boy, somewhat new boy
If you can't get Nelly you'a settle for who boy?
Two toy carrier, two stashes
One truck that seats six asses
Swing through to refuse the masses
Remove glasses, blow smoke up in my ashes
I used to drive my mama stuff
Now the school boy puttin' twenties on the bomb pop truck
I make rappers go back to the block
They be like ""maybe I was better off selling rocks""
I'm Murphey Lee in the place to be punk
And I got enough skunk to fill the whole blunt
I take trips with chumps up in my trunk
And I take 'em real far to a safe place to dump

Down down, I'm witcha dirty go head and lay down
Finance a pay down, heard what I said now?
See how I proceed with caution
My whip crack fast all you niggas is horses
Randy Moss', I play when I wanna
Nut check, gut check, cause I say what I wanna
Around six in the six with the throwback
Sixers, number six, Julius IRV
Cris and the herb, make it hard to swerve
Throw your hands up, if you didn't bang your rim on the curb
You couldn't hit while you was makin a turn
I strike a nerve and old MC's wantin a comeback
I got respect but it's lost and that's a fact
Like K ""know"" one here even said your name
Are you really feelin guilty bout somethin man
S sad to see you really just want just
One more hit please please

You the first old man who should get a rapper's pension
No we ain't system call this mic invention
Snitchin? Matter of fact stay the fuck out the kitchen
Nelly cookin with too many dimensions
Mid west, and we aim about mid chest
Duked on my side, too many in my tribe
Coupe outside who the fuck want a ride?

Its Nelly in the place with Murph Lee
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
(Yea)
You better watch what you say around her
'Cause there's somethin on my waste to make the whole place break

Its freeway in the place with state P
And we got what it takes to the rock the mic right, yea
Still watch what you say to be sig
'Cause we got what it takes to dump the D E, yea

All ya niggas, brand yourself
Go get the burnin' nigga, brand yourself
All ya niggas, brand yourself
Go get the burnin' nigga, brand yourself

I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
(Since we came down wit mo' sho' than the first time
I thought I'd go trade the Rover in for a six fo' this time)
A lil' mo' sho', listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop, zoop, zoop, zoop

[Verse: Nelly]
You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DNV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Every, gaga, they call me Daga
The rookie want to signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find anotha'
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my speeds
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? you come know fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris Slater, the love violator

[Verse: Ali]
Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend to got
I fuck twins from the back end
Back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go, iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Banudo, in the candy black Turro
BMW Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bid 70 kibble, ménage tua was civil
Crystal why yall, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar
Hit the mall nigga, and shop 'till we fall
And the bitches all be lovin' when we leave the bottle the car

[Verse: Kyjuan]
I'm comin' down down, baby, duck when you see me
When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throwup a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip a jets su Vokal
Nights mis-match , hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence harm in that?
On the yacht called once, where my warning at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet
Back in 1993 (was when a school boy decided to be an MC)
See some said no, others said fa' sho
(and now we comin' back down, this time in a six four)

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed, palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. to 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

To they attention dirty
That's all
You better watch
Who you talking about
Running your mouth
Like you know me
You gonna fuck around
And check
Why they surely
They call me
""Show me""
Why one-on-one
You can't hold me
If your last name was Haynes
Only way you wear me out
Is stitch my name
On your pants
No resident of France
But you swear
I'm from Paris
106 carats
Told 'em
""No that's per wrist""
Trying to compare
(Compare) This
My chain to your chain
I'm like sprint and Motorola
No service
Out of your range
You're out of your brains
Thinking I'ma
Shout out your name
You gotta come up
With better ways
Than that
To catch your fame
Only pressure you applying
Is time to ease off
Before I hit you
From the blind side
Taking your sleeves off
As much as we's lost
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lying, bitchin'
And crying
Sucking the bezel loss

Here take this sit down
And write it

What does it take to
Be number one?
Two is not a winner
And 3 nobody remembers

What does it take
To be number one?

I shake it for ya

Move it all around

Willing to get
In the driver's seat

Willing to turn
And not concerned about that

What I think he said?
Squash that
He probably got that off E-bay
Or some Internet access
Some website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine
Ooh don't wind up
On the flatline
Oh if my uncle
Could see me now
If he could see
How many rappers
Want to be me now
Straight emulating my style
Right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now
Better wait till
They calm down
I got hella shorty's
Coming askin' me
""Yo where the party?""

Got me banging fo sho

Judging what's real hip-hop
Half the time you be them niggas
Who's fucking album flop

It ain't left the dock

Mad 'cause I'm hot

Mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta
Gimme my props
Just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks
Keep my fans
Coming in flocks
Till you top the Superbowl
Keep your mouth on lock
Sh I'm awake ha ha
I'm cocky on the mic
But I'm humble in real life
Taking nothing for granted
Blessing everything on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Peep it, name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncouth
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreading the loot
With my
Family and friends
And my
Closest to kin
And I
Do it again

Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it

Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain

Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me

They got mo' juice in they veins, ooh God damn
I tell you man it's a cryin shame
How people use, the juice in vein, you hear me mayne
Pimp juice is color blind
You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
From ages 50 right down to 9
The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign
Watch me recline 'cause 
You wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry, slow down, bitch I got all night
Matter fact, stand on my left boo, I know you ain't right
You want my (come one)

Pimp juice hooh-ooh-hoo
I think I need to let it loose 
Let her loose, let her loose
She only want me for my pimp juice 
Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin' new pimp juice 
I think I need to cut her loose
Yes I do, yes I do

My juice my juice, she want the juice now
My juice my juice, she want my pimp juice
My juice my juice, she want my juice now
My juice my juice, she want my pimp juice ooh!","Pimp Juice (Remixed by Jason ""Jay E"" Epperson)"
Nelly,"[Chorus]
You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't (You don't even know)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't (It really really dont)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm bout to peel back the top on why'all and let in the sun
What the f*** I done done, my mamma's only son
I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one

I love my fans to death, until my last breath
that's why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same

Do they walk of fame, and all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin collars from California to D.C.
I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey

I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's
I'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens
I'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams
With anything that I want, if I don't I got the means

[Chorus]

You think you know me but you really don't know
Peep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho
And I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance,
I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn

It feels good when errthing is okay
And its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way
And I could park in the mountains and i'll still get valet
Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's

I'm feeling good its only right I deserve
To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge
And any n**** trippin now I leave him right by the curb
And I don't go to sleep mama so good night and good word

I'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery
And I ain't stopping til' I go down in history
Now who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho
The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go

[Chorus]

You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene
Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being
I'm doing human things, 'cause only humans change
They label me a role model 'cause i appeal to teens

It really ain't that strange, now that I think about it
I came up in the game, changed everything about it
I'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto s***
I wait up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some s***

You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips
We've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks
Donating money, the families called and be lying s***
They screaming war, I'm like f*** it, go buy a battleship

And bring it up that Mississipi, if you really want to come than get me
Tell them n****z that a, don't tempt me
'Cause I'll squeeze them s***s til' empty
Throw shouts at n**** like frisbee

Who the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?
You n****z must be kidding me,  i make an innocent n**** plead guilty

And break it down low to the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow

And everytime I +Busta Rhyme+, baby ""Gimme Some Mo'""
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind
And I'll be right back; yeah that's my very next line
I use it - time after time, when I'm speakin my mind

It's no matter if I'm shootin game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, ""Who dat is, talkin that shit about the 'tics?""
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, HEY!

Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me

In the black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin up, half black and asi-an
Another one pag-in, tellin me to come home

Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From +Phat Farm+ to +Iceberg Slim+ in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit the P hours

Kicked the bitch up out the room cause she used the word ours, HEY!

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Aiyyo I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin icky
Let go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin when the shows out - whatchu mean?!

Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut - come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut - is you wit me?
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut

Then I slide up in the Escalade
Me and E gettin solid like the Ice Capades
And me and Heezy - frosty, project mo' wrapped up than Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies

If you compare me to your local grocery
Then you'll see I got more carrots/karats than ""Aisle D""
More bread than ""Aisle G"", then bag and scan me
+Sure+ like +Al B.+, meet the 'tics in Maui, HEY!

Groovin', groovin', groovin' tonight
Ha, yeah, what you, what you think about that nigga?
Do do do doo
Hah, hah, what you think about that nigga? Ladies
Said, ""I wanna get it on""

Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her
I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardan
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order
So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight

""Skuie"" baby girl, you hear me callin' you?
Now I ain't hawkin' you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin' in that err
Whatever it takes to make you come nerr
I'm tryna' sound sincerr, ay
Baby talkin' to me but I'm starin' at her rear and I'm like, ""Oh dear""
I ain't never seen nathen like you before
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door

And to the house up on the hill and the Jag is yours
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, aye
But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight, aye

Keep it movin', keep it movin', I keep it groovin'
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it groovin'
I keep it movin', keep it groovin'

Yo, baby girl you lookin' fly in yo' Donna K
Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin', ""Hello""
You still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow
So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for Dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man
Got 'em whinin' like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up, baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here
Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop
Then hit the block with my niggaz in, my new drop
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
One-sixty on the dash, chinky eyes and leather, c'mon

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight, aye

Say what's up, Pharrell

These motherfuckers Nell
But, let's show 'em what's above the Nell Bling
A hundred thou couldn't get you one of these (Not one of these)
I guarantee it ain't a flaw on one of these (One of these)
Two hundred thou, couldn't get you in the league
And three hundred thou, you couldn't even buy the keys
I think you need to add 50 more G's
Now, shall I proceed?
(Ladies:) Yes, indeed (Ho)
I need to see you take it down to the floor
Spread your wings, if you real, ma, fly real low
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right
Bordero we'll go (Ho)
I'm talkin lil' fresh eagle, girl (ealge, girl)
? with your bag all beaded, girl
Apple bottom with the pearl in the needed
You talkin' like you don't need it
I can tell you can see it
I like that in you
I don't see nothing wrong
Drop down and get your eagle on (Whoa)

To try something up in this party
OPP time, now, let's get naughty
You take baby girl, and I'ma take shorty
With the sweat drippin' all over her body
We gone move if you want to (Oh)
Groove if you want to (Oh)
Throw your nose up, ma, and get rude if you want to
Ain't got nothin' to lose, nor to prove
Baby girl soaking like she just got out of the pool (Eh)
I know you're thirsty, ma
Go ahead and order whatchu want
Some call it trickin', go ahead and call it whatchu want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
Cause the black pick up what the gray card won't

Got me attackin' this
I'm so fabulous

She want to fly south for the winter (For the winter)
I might just go down south just to win her (Just to win her)

Take your pants off, ma, you can leave your panties on
But, first drop down and get your eagle on (Oh)

I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for)
You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for, you)

I remember February 27 1994
Trying to make it to the hospital through three inches of snow
Somethings going wrong I can tell but I don't know
I got this feeling in my gut this ain't how I supposed to go
Three pounds two ounces and two months premature
To the incubator is she going make it they ain't sure
Automatically I placed the blame on my health
Hell I'm a father man, I placed the blame on myself
Was it something that I smoked, did I eat or did I drink it
Or was it something I was doing that I did or did I think it
Watching her breathe through her holes in her nose
What's this CKG machine, whats this shit on her toes
This 94 I'm 85 so I'm spooked as can be
I'm praying and I'm asking why he do this to me
See, I used to hold you in the palm of my hand
And just to see you pull through, shit I knew you'd pull through

You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for)
You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for, you)

March the 2nd, 1999

The year and the date I got my little mine
I guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt
And his father must have felt to see himself
Its like a lil' me in the flesh
He got my blood and my heart in his chest
Needless to say man I love him to death
Teach him if he disrespect me I'm'a love him to death
Left to go out of town right after he was born
Got a record deal three months later, daddy was gone
Its like I'm trying to raise him over the phone
He barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone
I'm up at night like do he know who his daddy is
I'm real close to saying fuck the showbiz
But when I here him call his daddy na
And when I here him tell his friends I want to be jus like my daddy na
Hope he forgive me for the sacrifice
So he can have a better life, than I had

You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for)
You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for, you)

You, don't ya know I'd die for ya
I'd lay down my life for ya (i would, die for)

[Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha ha oh
N dey say oh oh oh
Ha ha ha ha ha oh
N dey say oh oh oh

Hold up stop now let me get a look at ya,
Damn girl I ain't seen you since prom,
Come to think about it I can't believe its been that long,
I heard your man locked down now how long he gone, Oh dat long
How the hell he get time like that?
Three strikes with possession, aww he ain't comin back,
He left you with 2 kids and bills all around,
Plus you found out he had another chick cross-town,
It's always the darkness right before the sun rises
And you gotta stay strong for the kids in their eyes and
Please don't despise and go against all brothers and
have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another,
I hate to sound Tupacish now momma but keep your head up,
But you gon' make it I promise you keep your head up
And that, that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed will only feed the hunger, Fo' Reel (Fo' Reel, Fo' Reel)

[Chorus]

I was at the gas station and a man walked past
With his sign will work for food, clothes or cash
and he asked if he could pump my gas, so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash, so I let him (Hey)
I even asked a brother his name, where he was from, got kids man and what's their ages
He kinda stuttered for a second, he kinda looked surprised that anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said young brother them the only words I done heard in the last year that wasn't no or get the fuck away from here
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation? (Hey)
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in the title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone, then realize we even had it, Fo' Reel (Fo' Reel, Fo' Reel)

[Chorus]

I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until I realized life had to be planned by me, see that's the key
I only deal with what I can see cause over history, mystery brought us nothing but misery
Man more people done died in the name of the lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gangwars
Before guns there was swords and they was killing each other
and what's changed to this day still killing each other
Killing a brother while another mother cries for help
Man! we need to help a brother find them self
Feed em light 1, 2, 3
Hey! that's something every brother should see and that's Fo' Reel,
and that's Fo' Reel, and that's Fo' Reel

I... didn't know, there'd be troubles along the way

I went through, 8 different schools in, 12 different years
That's 30 different teachers, over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought in e'ryone, been suspended e'rytime
Besides a few a felony, done committed e'ry crime
But never braggin on, just want you to see me what I done done
I'm never proud of it, so I don't have to go back there again
And uhh, I used to go like house to house (man)
Sleepin on couch to couch (you know)
Walk around stickin out my hands, lookin for a handout
Only thing I handed out was more bills
Only thing pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills
Either that or go beat the block
Ain't no way you can beat the cops
Ain't no way I can beat the clock
Just a matter of time shut down your shop
Ohh, you stay up day and nights, livin this way of life
I was +Young and Restless+
+All My Children+ came and then I had a +Guiding Light+ (hey)
No more of that sittin mayne (c'mon) sittin and waitin
and thinkin somebody comin to take me up off them streets
But now I know..

[Chorus - Anthony Hamilton]
Nobody told me that the road would be easy, yeah
I don't believe, I've made it this far
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know
Nobody told me that the road would be easy (Whoaaaaaa, that the road)
I can't believe, I've made it this far (Whoo, yeahhh)
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know

[Nelly]
I can tell you right now, I'm sayin
I could sit here and count on one hand
How many people seen me graduate
I know a few that did but a bunch that ain't (hey)
Same folks showin up in swarms, waitin for me to go on
Wantin to see Ali perform, wasn't so po' before
I became this household name
I was playin them Little League games
Nobody curred if I go 0-for-3
Nobody out hurr rootin for me but my Momma
Supported me in e'rything, ""Why she get e'rything?""
Some people got the nerve to ask
why'all can kiss my a**, and that's my Momma
Got a sister that need my help (hey) and I gave peace all with wealth
Give anything that I have, just to see her in perfect health
Now we out hurr complainin, ""I got work to do"" (ohh)
How bad you think you got it, somebody else got it worse than you (hey)
I done had them down and ups and, don't plan on comin back down (no)
Don't plan on leavin hurr no time soon, but I got too comfortable now
Wouldn't have no knowledge of wealth, without no knowledge of self
And I'ma keep walkin this road - my mind, body and soul
I know [echoes]

[Chorus]

[Anthony Hamilton]
I didn't knowwwww
There'd be troubles along the way (I didn't know there'd be troubles)
Nobody told me nothin (nobody told me nothin)
That would help me to ease my pain (to help ease my pain, yeah)
I've been walkin this roooooad, for forever and a day (forever and a day)
Now I've been searchin somethin (whoa-ohhh)
For someone to help me find my way (somebody help me, find my way)

Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?
They like to work out, and I ain't talking Tae-Bo

Rewind that, pop and grind that

Get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
Cute bright skin brown skin take me to the mountain
Get you wet like a fountain
Then get your counseling, have a seat have a drink have a toke

Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it
Thinkin' it won't go, I went to see the doctor
X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets
Just like a cold 'cause I'm so sick-wid-it

It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes
My yours and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a face lift
I'm just so hungry I can taste it

Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
Pushin' buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day
I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to rock the mic

City locked down, right before me and the other 'Tics went down

y'all see the T.S. we shining, come to the be-X we grinding
y'all want to be us keep trying, we buying, he's lying

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, ladies!

[Remy Martin]
We like, fuck, that; I need a stack
And like, forty-nine to go with that
I'm quick to, tell a hoe her flow is wack
The type to, cop the jersey, throw it back
See I can stunt and tell a chick ""Yo let your man hang out""
Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe
Yeah, I been testing law with the darkest tints
So explicit valet had to tip to park the shit 
I'm like a, block away and the whip be starting 
Oh God, it's Remy Martin!

[Chorus: Repeats]",Grand Hang Out
Nelly,"C'mon, 
I guess he's back 'urr dirty, s-t-l derby
I'm like magic to Kareem, man you tell me I ain't worthy
I ain't speaking 'bout a jersey, I'm speaking 'bout income
Did you hear that Elizabeth? here come the big one!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a general custard
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer, in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Superbowl, with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screaming the name
Nelly! Nelly! go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'ma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'ma fight to the end
Let's go

[Chorus]
Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring coming
It's the blood of a champion, pumping
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be running
I'ma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothing
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playing for his hometown, repping for the home ground
And getting buffer like Michael Riggs, tell 'em again
I gets buffer like Michael Riggs, heard what I said?
The m-v-p of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shooting out from my reign, with Peyton Manning type aim
Can't stop me from scoring so they results are just hacking
So there's, three of us now,- me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been raven about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin' or if I'm sittin' and readin'
Waitin' for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a brick, man
Ain't no way they blow, know, ain't no way they can, know
Ain't no way they can, know, ain't no way they can, know

[Chorus]

It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin' what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin'
I've been dogfightin', scratchin' and clawin' on every height
I'm gonna to make you remember me like you 'Remember The Titans'
Cause I'm a warr-ior, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young black and rich
As good as it gets, and givin' your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh
Ain't no way they can blow, know, ain't no way they can, know
Ain't no way they can blow, know, ain't no way they can, know

Whattup ma, the name H doe, I'm into pesos
V.I.P. and champagne by the caseloads
Doubles get you from that bar, and get you right

Or get you bent, whatever you like
I'm not into wifin - no sir
I just want to beat it up, hear the kitty-cat purr
The whip or the tail, whichever you prefer

The crib off limits, got wifey durr
Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah I'll show you how to twist

Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick
I'll show you which end to burn, how to spot that trick
All you need is the will to learn
.. and some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

[Chorus]
I need a man, who's up on his game
And can give me some affection, satisfy me many ways
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
Then maybe I can hook up witcha later

Babe girl you now rockin with strength, Infamous Thugs is nuttin to slug
Anyone, they try to ruin our fun
I don't want to scare you away, I'm sayin wha**up
Tell your friends come over here, and party with us

If why'all from the hood, why'all gon' love our ways
Cause we got money, and we still the same way
Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great

Yeah tonight we gon' have a little too much to drink
Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We goin' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe

I ain't into games, I'll give it to you straight
We can have a part time love, I just want it straight
Really doe, I changed doe, not no dames
So however you want to call it, it's okay

Uhh, uhh, aiy
Check it, check it, check it
Baby girl right here is where you need to be
You better duck cause the bottles pop easily

Go and get your other friends, cause you comin with me
Dirty E-N-T with the M-O-be	
See, no respect for the +Country Grammar+
So I kick the Dunn language, the response was better

We like, 'Dunn' did it, 'Dunn' hit it, 'Dunn' split it
Everything hon wanted, Dunn was with it
She like to see me doo-rag'd and me ball-cap'd
She like to see me tailored, Gator'd, slacked

In fact, I see you lookin through the windshield wipers
As the rain hit the windows on the blue Dodge Viper
The sniper, not never but hit ya from long range
Check it, got haters like X had Brother Baines

Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter games
Got a quarter of a movie, here come {?} trains

I'm not tryin to be your girlfriend you dig
I ain't even tryin to lock you in
There's no need for us to pretend
I'd rather spend yo' dividends

You and me can be lover friends
I'd rather keep this between us two
Let me know when you want to begin
And let me tell you what I want from you

Seen me on wheels before, man you should see me now

I sit up on the hill, but I'm still down to earth
I'm like the Rams man I'm at the best when on my turf
You watch your girl flirt, you watch your girl tease
You think your girl want cheese? Then check your girl knees
You need to check her needs, before I check 'em for ya
Cause once I check her needs, she won't be checking for ya

I'm buying bikes for tykes, there'll be some uniforms
While they just rap about we fo' sho' fo' kids and show 'em
At elementary schools, the day of show and tell
We didn't come to show, mo' like we came to tell
Tell 'em how to keep it strong, on how to keep it tight
To tell they right from wrong, to turn your wrong right
Watch all they words and actions, thoughts companies and habits
Leave them tricks for rabbits, that greed for the savage
And you can make it happen, if you just don't give up
I guarantee that you can be that anything you want
Give 'em that real talk, show 'em that real walk
And maybe one day you can be like me, somewhere

Nelly,"Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say

Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

What it do baby
Its the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

Watch the Crips loc' it up, we back, we got our focus up
St. Lunatics, nigga know that, know that
Supreme team, if we lose you open your minds
Start readin' some things, we got it, holla at us, c'mon
Easy with that murder murder murder, kill kill
We did that back when I was born, Bill Bill
But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math
I rock a seven-and-a-half for my seven-and-a-half
I be with Moses and Cain and Abel puttin' in work
I slap a nun, beat the reverend up, spit in his church
My derrty niggas come through, we turn the heat up in June
We at the party mackin', even throw a bitch in the room

Start your cars up, trick your broads out
Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up
You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to
You was doin' a lot of talkin' (yup) a lot of barkin'
But your bite was nothin', guess you mighta been frontin'
Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt
Don't, test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the feelin' go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win
You was born to hate me, you should be born again
You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them
You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em
Take a look at us dirty, we put the star in them
No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre'n them

You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free
Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin' with Ky'
You see I stays real high, but I be's low-key
I'm so allergic to the line everybody know me
You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?
'Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great
And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late
I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste
My lady is so happy, yours masturbates
You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake
The way y'all copy our style ASCAP should make y'all pay
But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point
The motherfucking point is keep my name out your mouth
Unless you sayin' how we repped the Lou, since we came out
We've been winners since we came out, yo' mouth keep my name out
You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds with they things out

My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me)
Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty)
That means you stinkin', what you think's extinct
Been gone too long to even dig up the bones
I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo
That's a big step, but that's how niggas from the Lou do
Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot
You wack rappers think you hot when you not (this is why I'm hot)
All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit
Thinkin' you deserve my spot, well there it is then
Gave niggas time but now I'm back with a few of my friends

Always used the right amount of strokes, that's why I stayed par
I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are
You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car
My decor, might be Levi's and a A-R
Fifteen G's in my pocket just to play cards
So meet me in the casino, way in the back
Me and her fleein' the scene, away in the 'Llac
She say she feelin' her bean, a green of a stack
She say she like it obscene, I'm way in the knack
In fact, you niggas ain't like me, you salty (no)

I'm looking for these girls on this LAX
Trying to find them niggas with that LA best
Dodging them niggas with that LA Stress
See I'm a visitor I'm a LA guest
I got to be aware on how the LA dress
'Cause if it comes down I might get LA stretched
I ain't trying to be a trophy on no LA desk
Some niggas walk up tossing LA sets
I guess this supposed to be some type of LA test
Better watch the girls with the LA chest
A lot of plastic in those LA breasts
I hit the Crenshaw where they LA stunt
Seen a lot of sixty four's and LA trucks
Seen a lot of girls with them LA butts
A lot of niggas with them dickies and chucks (ya feel me)

Yo I spend a lot of time on this LA coast
Out here trying to do the LA most
Chauffeur driven Phantom like a LA ghost
In the back with a drink take a LA toast
I spend a lot of time in them LA heels
With them models actresses and them LA heels
To my lawyers office for a LA deal
Cut the check for some LA kneels
Now I'm off to Rodeo just to LA shop
Still getting dirty looks from some LA cops
You than thought since Rodney King LA stopped
When they burn the LA watts
I send a lot of love to my LA brothers
My Latinos and my Negroes in them LA colors
My blessings go out to those LA mothers
Know that Nelly is an LA lover

Guess who just stepped in the place (the Midwest)
It's your OG homie Nate (all day)
My homie snoop and Nelly (La)
And we all up in your face (all day)

See I don't drop every year to give you niggaz a shot
Now I might not get five mics or a double-XL (never)
But fuck it, you keep it, I'm a take the 100 mil'
And the Murciélago with the rim kitted Tahoe
The show stopper, when I ride all you hear is ""Bravo"" (bravo!)
And all you hear is, ""There he go""
You see my paint job's a fool, my paint job be poppin
My paint job's so wet my license plates read (what it read?) pussy 
Shut yo' mouth

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
Listen now I, I
She wanna know what my girlfriend know
And uh, she wanna see how deep this can go
She wanna know how much she can blow
She wanna know what my girlfriend know

She 'bout to blow, 'bout to blow
She 'bout to blow, there they go",Let It Go Lil' Mama
Nelly,"Uh yo yo
I'm tired of the he say she say
Why every time they get mad man we pay
She wanna act like the judge and the jury
The police FBI and CIA

And now it's me she trying to convict
She better show me some DNA and fingerprints
She better show me the name of the one who snitched
Matter of fact right now I'm a plead the fifth

(she said you tried to fuck her)
She's a motherfucking lie
(boy please) no way

She's a motherfucking lie
(boy please) no way

Take it to the grave [Repeat: x8]

She said she did what? with who she wrong
If she know so much ask her what I had on
True religion Air Jordan Ed Hardy c'mon ma that's every nigga at the party
But I was at the studio perfecting my hustle
With Kee Murphy mo just finishing Brass Knuckles
Now with all these verses fur coats fly whips 
I done bought for you ma now you still believe that shit
Are you serious?

[Chorus]

3:24 when I walked in the door
Phone on lie what it do that for (damn)
She said she went down south all in my texts
3:30 in the morning got this loud ass message
I didn't even do it though mama girl lying
(you tried to fuck her)
I didn't even have time
Ask her where she know me from
Who I be with
What number she dial that crazy girl wild

[Chorus]

I really don't know her
I've seen her on Myspace
Looked on her page all I seen was my face
Her user name read Kewan for life
With videos and pictures set up so right
The only bad thing she writes me all night
Saying shit like her tits are so tight
She ends it with I love you that starts a big fight
Baby I can't control what she type

So let me stop for a minute take a sec to say
Girl you take my breath away
Away, girl you take my breath away
You take my breath away, you take my breath away

Or one I find pain and next time I find pleasure,
I wont pay attention to the haters now or never,

It's like I die every time I see you with this guy,
Think in it's myself why the hell it's with that guy,
Why she isn't by my side,we would be so fly,
We would live that life,
The life we used to dream, talked back then,
Back when I used to pull my BMX up along to your swing,
See here we are again,
Funny how faith brought my fame up along side of your Benz
And still

And my momma had problems of her own
But I still managed to make it out okay
Oh, oh
Although I'm hailed as a hometown hero
Still in my hometown I'm seen as a negro
But man, that's okay
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
It's so many obstacles in life to overcome
And as soon as you jump over one here come another come
But we got to be strong, and set examples for our sons
If the sun don't shine, then the decaying has begun

[Chorus]

They say I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to play in the NBA no more
Now you tell me, what's wrong with that?
I pledge allegiance all the way to Iraq
But ain't nobody pledgin' to me when I get back
Tell my Uncle Sam he wrong for that
Ah ah ah, woo!
You see my self-esteem, I'm never leavin' home without it
They told me I'd never make it, they told me I ain't doubt it
Now tell me whoever make it, now tell me I ain't got it
I'm seein (No Limits) nigga, who sayin' I ain't ('Bout it)?
Woo!

I know I can
I think I, no, I know I can
I think I, no, I know I can
Know I can, know you can

Rock on Nelly, rock on my brother
Keep your head up over the storm, young fella (oh!)
Got a letter from the government, opened and read it
Uhh, and told 'em all to forget it
C'mon, 'cause we believe in the future
Uncle Sam sent his man to recruit ya
You still can't trust it, 'cause you came this far
End of discussion, when you KNOW who you are

That's right believe, c'mon now
Don't let nobody tell you, what you can be

You wanna stand looking so not gangsta
Plead to the judge ""I'm so not gangsta""

When you done with the minors ma come to the pros
See I could put you in all them clothes
Your neck, wrist, ears, hands, all that froze
He could never ever put you in a rose
But anything goes when you dealin' with the baller
Stand on my money if I wanna be taller
Smack him with a G, I bet he go and get his lawyer
'Cause he really wanna sue me
Take the bitch route, cause he know he cannot do me
Know he can't outdo me in the records or the movies
Man, I don't want your girl, plus I heard she got the cooties
If you mean what you feel then I mean what I said
You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed
Spread it all out and we can roll around in it
Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it
In the back seat and we can go to town in it
Or maybe on the hood, sound profound, did it?
He ain't get the message ma, act like he ain't get it
He ain't catch a hint when you gave him back his rented
Now his lil' condo one less tenant
And I did it, but you know what?

Well who you know with ten mil' on a plaque?
Hit the Superbowl once so they brought me on back
Ride around with my Grammy's on the 'Llac

Me be the rapper, Nicky Bonds be the crack
Think I fell off when they fell from the track
You wanna come to Nellyville I'll draw you the map
Follow that yellow brick road
Follow that rainbow of diamonds down to the gold
Follow shorty as she slide down a pole
He tryna make it rain but it's comin' down slow
I hope he got the gloves cause I'm about to make it snow
(Ohh, ohh, ohhh...)
Like kids seein Santa when I walked in the club
(Hohh, hohh, hohhh...)
But I only brought presents for the girls
Listen, play with me nigga if you wanna, if you feel
Won't kill at will but will kill Bill

Nelly,"You're a warrior fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above and brought down the world below

You're the son of his majesty
Remember how it used to be
In the light of day it's easy to see
Now it's nighttime
You had to leave

Separated from the king
Now the water's rushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
And it seems, like your not moving the many water's gushing you gasp for air
Almost drowning ears ringing, once upon a time we were singing
One day the trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa, this place is just a shell, external
Egos swell, that one'll burn ya, we fell a long way down, that eternal frown'll get you
You look vexed it's the dregs, the yetzer hara's lurking
Trying to make you forget we got a job to do
You're a priest and a prince and you can't be moved

[Chorus]
You're a warrior, fighting for your soul
Taken from a world above, and brought down to a world below
Re-united, re-united return the princess to the king,
Re-united, re-united, she's been taken for so long
Re-united, re-united and then she'll be filled with joy
Re-united, re-united like the days of her youth

Descended to the pit
What's this feeling can't get rid of it
Soul sick
Can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping, joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong

[Chorus]

Like and ancient memory
Remember how it used to be
Close your eyes and breath in
That's the scent of freedom
Ringing across the sea
Land of milk and honey
One day will wake up from this dream and we'll stop sleeping,
Oh, yo, then we'll see clearly

[Chorus]",Warrior [Version]

In them Giuseppe Zanotti's and that bangin' ass body
In them low cut Frankie B.'s with the panties peekin' out 'em
With a booty that big, and her stomach rock solid
On Rodeo Drive, walkin' in her Roberto Cavalli
I should probably walk up to the register and say ""I got it""
Go and pick up what you like, it's nothin' ma, don't worry about it
That bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
And that dress should be worn when there's nothin' else up under
Just in case I run into you I can pull up to your bumper
She politely declined when I offered her my number
Then I asked her what's her name, said she'd rather make me wonder
So I paid and she laughed, carried out her bags outside
And I couldn't get her ass, I tried
As I watch her leave out the store
How one man wanted shorty ass and more, for sure

Shorty bring the Cialis
See my hand, got the money countin' callus
Couldn't find a bigger star down in Dallas
And the Pistons ain't the only one with rings in (The Palace)

Take a jet and make you wonder where you land like Alice
Tell me shorty ain't the baddest
Tell me shorty don't deserve to walk the runway in Paris

I don't do the mall, I do it by catalog

The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar,
System got us hopeless, and focused on foreclosures

But they gotta teach themselves how to reload

Sometimes it feels like I cant win

Brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promise 
Of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, 
I'm trying to live

'Cause all I want is a better way,
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know

For everyone I believed in
I was going insane, they were screaming our name
While were spraying champagne
There's nothing nobody can say

Cause today is the day
Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever
When you call me, you call me the champ of the world
I can raise my hands
I can scream I'm the best in the world
Whole world all my blood, sweat and grind
Was all for this time

Lap after lap, mile after mile
Push up after push up, everybody count it out
Everybody up, now we back down
All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now
All from different places well we came with each other
We came together as a team,
But we're leaving as brothers
Standing next to one another while we hold up our colors

That daytime that night time man anytime she with
That's why that YSL and that Louboutin and that Gucci bag she get
I ride out she ride out, I'm somewhere she flyin' out
Quit me and she wilin' out, I click clack she fired out like (pow pow)
My 45 her 9's out like (pow pow)
Then stop, like timeout
No disrespect to your broad I know she might be your hard
But mine is more like my brain, without her man I'm insane
Got down b**** and a round a**
Shotgun in the ghost while I'm whipping up the coast
Passin' ? while I'm whipping up the dope

Throw down in the kitchen, might need better then moms
Wake me up with some head, ain't no better alarm
Move in by myself, a force when we together
I was sick of these n****s, of course she made me better
I put her in her position others never could be in
Couple racks for her shoes but she never been skiing
Kind you never be seeing, everything European

Lift weights I pound up in it
Hit the walls I climb up in it
Applause need a round up in it
Ever lost I get found up in it
I'm a boss and my lady floss when I take her down in rodeo
You would think they was on pay roll
They don't close the store till I say so
And the car I'm riding is payed for

You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no
You liked me 'til you seen me on your t.v.
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face, the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight, open fire, turn in the spitfire, open fire
Scream without making a sound, open fire, be up here without looking down, open fire
Oh afraid of heights

I've seen him say to me that he is only mine
That he gotta do what is best for him
Never let me in, not even begin
To tell me I'm the one under his moon and sun
That I am the thing that revolves around him
But while on top of him I know what's best for him
I'll show him how to win and let me in because

I don't want to be your baby girl
I don't want to be your little pearl
I just want to be what's best for me
To be one-da-dumb with my own star under my own sun

We're all sorry now
I didn't mean to wow
Make you cry like that
It's just a little spat
Still I want you to know
Though I love you so
It's mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing
That you're an ideal
Hell I never steal
But I stole you from
From another one
So take yourself and wrap around my little finger
'cause that's how it should swing

I don't want to be your baby girl

Don't you, don't you call me coochie-coo a little girl now...
Don't you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now I'm so much more, can't you see? Can't you see?
Look who's writing now a token of their love
Can't you see love that it's just because
I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head

And not a cheap way to get inside your bed
Oh your running now, with that silly one
It's all over now, this woman's just begun
Maybe we'll see about the will and the way
Butterflies return someday

You know I'm only testing you out.
Hey man, don't look so angry,
You're real close to figuring me out.

We are a part of a circle.
It's like a mobius strip,
And it goes round and round until it loses a link.
And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again.

Hey, man, we look at each other with ample eyes,
So why not some time to discover what's behind your eyes?
I've got so many questions that I want to ask you.
I am so tired of mirrors- pour me a glass of your wine!

And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again!
I've got a bunch of government checks at my door.
Each morning I try to send them back but they only send me more.
I look at myself in the mirror; am I vital today?
Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way!

And there's a shadow in the sky , and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again,
And I don't mean to rain on your parade,
But pathos has got me once again
And I don't want ambivalence no more,
I don't want ambivalence no more,

too good to give it to you You run your own course at your own pace but I just 
got impatient See, I wanted to explore Forsake you, forsook you, abate you, 
dissipate you So turn fate around, I believed that I was free of you (not)

Nelly Furtado,"I'm talking to the mirror again but it's not listening
I'm cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it won't give in
I'm drinking spirits in the hopes that I will find myself one
But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun

[Chorus:]
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel like falling asleep and never waking up
It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup
When all of the doors around me just shut one by one
I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun

[Chorus]
Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Of limbs and tooth under my skin
Oh, freedom, where do I begin
I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words
Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard
Oh, death of the party
I picked up the chalice of malice
And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full, 
I drank till I, till I,till I was full

There's a fever in my bones that I know so well
I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
'cause you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake
You cannot fuel without a tank, 
no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break

I'm sorry that I left you
I'm sorry I did forget you

Maybe that is why I was

Scared of you 
And in everything I do I'm still thinking of you
And I know you were scared of me too

Desculpa-me se te ofendi
Desculpa-me se te esqueci
Desculpa-me se eu te deixei

Do que a minha

Nelly Furtado," I left my heart in San Francisco 
With some club kids on a crowded street somewhere 
The sky was red and he said, 
""Would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream?""
I could try to chase life down, down the street and I'd find the separation 
Of fact and fiction

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

I left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm
I heard about it from the mouth of a man
He was hopping some trains and combing the land
Looking for a lover (kiss) planted in the east
Trying to run from the dreaded fist beast
And it lies, it lies in the picket fence call
It was my own paradise with my own private corridor

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed
My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said
Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone-no
You'll never walk alone, but
Travel to the land of surrender till' you can't cry no more
Till you can't, till you can't
And you'll never walk alone

You'll nev, you'll nev, you'll never walk alone, you'll nev, 
You'll nev, you'll never walk alone
Never walk, never walk alone alone, alone
All this inspiration is passing me by
All I can do is chill when I really wanna fly
And this pollution do nothing but dirty up my mind
Faster than forever in the blink of an eye
To see past my lethargy is hard I feign
The beauty of my youth is 
Gone but the chemicals remain

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

I travel to this land of surrender but I see it's all over me, over and over 
Again and I try and I try and I try an angel on my left side and a devil 
On my right and they fight and they fight and they fight they're fighting, 
They're fighting, they're fighting for my attention...hello? 
You have my attention
Do I have your attention
Can I have your attention please?
Please, you've made such, such an impression on me",Trynna Finda Way
Nelly Furtado,"(People, people, people)

It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (by the moon)
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some

Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah
All in me, yeah

Where is your logic
Turn of the light, turn off the light
Who do you need
Turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
Where can you turn

Where is your logic

Who do you need
Follow me follow me follow me down down
Turn off the light, turn off the light

Nelly Furtado,"Well, well, what do I say
Looks like what goes around comes around
And everyone will have their final say
Sometime, someday
Looks like I only love God when the sun shines my way
Looks like I'm into divinity only when I can see its sweet, sweet rays

[Chorus]
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out today
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out

Well, well, what do I say
I've never seen a bad day look quite this way
And well, well, what do I do
When all of my thoughts run right back to you
Looks like I meant to speak with logic,
But hon', the carnal always gets in the way
Well, well, this fire was more funner than proper grammar anyway

[Chorus]

Then you get to the part where your heart just wants to die
Then you get to the part where your heart screams it just sighs
Then you get to the part where your heart knows it's a crime
So it flies like a bird, it's heard, it's heard, it's heard the word

[Chorus]

Today, today, today, today
Well, well, it's fine out","Well, Well"

Or being able to carry a pretty song

And it all comes to life so, so suddenly
This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause
All the energy it takes to feel this power
I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you

Vera's face burnt as a memory of bedroom fun
With a lighter and some hairspray
Smoking in the girls' room
Not worse than Shelley's rape behind the McDonald's
By a man she thought was fine, didn't tell anybody
Or maybe back then we just thought that she was getting some

Now we look back and see that she didn't know how
We never thought that we'd get caught up
Stuck in the teenage waste

As we explode
As we explode

Then getting drunk in the bushes by the road outside the Kmart
Rolling around in them to see if you would get prickled
Slip the acid on your tongue rooftop mall parkade
We couldn't get enough

Then count the stars and the ten million woes
Just you and the universe judging each other
We never knew that we'd get caught up

Such a good, good story to tell

Or maybe a traveling book
Wanted to get on that plane and fly away
cause you are a rock star deep down inside
You walk with a swagger, got nothin' to hide 
Cigarette in your mouth, a cuff on your jeans
Your sideburns are perfect, you're a perfect and lean
So you made an oil painting to immortalize
All of the hope and vision in your eyes
In your leisure coat and cowboy hat
North American records and so much to bat for

Please bring me along
Please bring me along
Because I want to see everything you have to offer me

Get a job lifting cement
Oh it's so dry when it rains it gets wet
And the village was great, now it's a suburb
You left behind half of all that you had learnt
Relearn a couple things along the way
The thrift shop so clean all for half what you'd pay
So you try everything on, on for size
Drop top your Camaro and go for a ride

Please bring me along
Please bring me along
Because I want to see everything you have to offer me

Hot black tar

And dream of the city

Magazine and diet coke
I'm not a joke
This is me
Damaged leg
Heavy cart
Plastic cups
Linen mart

Rock garden
Where I used to play
People stare
Part of their day
Coffee break
Lunch at noon
Pumpernickel steak
Green and orange room

Done my list
I Make my way
To help my mother
End her day 
Fresh cut grass

We roll on out
We got a lot

We're on our way
Roll the windows down 
And scream out loud

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try, try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people are really not real at all
The more I learn the more I learn
The more I cry the more I cry
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try
Oh, try, try

All of the moments that already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be, we never will be

I know you've got me in your heart baby 
I know that you could love me 
If you only had a guarantee

I know I could fill you with love baby 
Your soul is dying for me 
Can't deny our energy

I know that this is hard for you
Want you to know that I'm feeling it too 
It's taken some time but now I see everything

Nelly Furtado,"There are only two places I could go
One is dark and it feels so hollow
And it lets me in only to swallow
To much water until I drown, baby

And the other place is calm and sweet
I can almost feel wings beneath my feet
And I don't care if it feels to deep
I like it, I like it

And I know you wanna take a chance
And I know you wanna understand me
And let me in

But you runaway from what you know
And you runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take the time show me your love tonight

There are only two places that I see
One is strong, and the other one feels so weak
And this plan feels so strange to me
It's all I see, baby

And I know you wanna let it go
And I know you wanna flow this love
But you can't

So you, runaway from what you know
And you, runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take the time, show me your love tonight
Oh yeah, tonight

All the angels know what I know
You're an angel that sings to me
It's the greatest secret of all
I am free from thinking

But you runaway from what you know
And you runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take the time, let's make love

Don't runaway from what you know
Don't runaway, just let it go
I don't wanna wait for you to tell me what's right
Don't fight it, let's make love tonight

Nelly Furtado,"Estuve bien estuve mal
Tuve rabia tuve paz
Y todo lo que te-di
Por un tuvo se fue
En el cielo me senti
Y en el suelo me vi
Una vida asi
No es posible vivir

Quiero sentir-me mejor
Quiero sentir-me mejor
Carino mio sentirnos mejor
Por eso

Te busque de bajo de las piedras y no te-encontre 
En la manana fria y en la noche te-busque 
Hasta enloquecer 
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz 
Sanando las heridas de mi corazon 
Haciendo me-sentir vivo otra vez

No podia hablar
Ni tampoco comer
No queria cantar
No sabia que hacer
Esa herida sangro
Y mis ojos perdi
Pero ahora yo soy el futuro de los dos

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer 
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her 
I ache for this earth 
I stopped going to church 
See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees 
My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling 
My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge 
It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes 
Cuz they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry

I've been high I've been low
I've been fast I've been slow
I've had nowhere to go
Missed the bus missed the show
I've been down on my luck
I've felt like giving up
My life locked in a trunk
When it hurt way too much
I needed a reason to live
Some love inside me to give
I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching

Te busque de bajo de las piedras y no te-encontre 
En la manana fria y en la noche te-busque 
Hasta enloquecer 
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz 
Sanando las heridas de mi corazon 
Haciendo me-sentir vivo otra vez

I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat 
Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings 
I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future 
In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure 
I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right 
I needed an answer to end all my searching

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer 
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her 
I ache for this earth 
I stopped going to church 
See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees

My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge

Nelly Furtado,"Am I throwing you off?
Nope!
Didn't think so
How ya doing young lady
The feeling that you gave me really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on your trunk
I was at a loss of words
First time that we spoke

If your looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you looking for her in the day time in the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand

I'll be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you, you seem so loose

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

[Chorus]
Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
You ready?

Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kind a cute

Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come too

I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas
Last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine's down

I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I may need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else.

Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go

What kind of girl do you take me for?

[Chorus]

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

Bring that on?
You know what I mean

Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Is it the truth, are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And its you that I want
Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait

You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

I'll look back on my life
I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life

I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all

I guess it was just a dream
And time changes many things
But my heart it still sings
For you, I don't know why

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

Don't wanna leave your comforts
Wanna find a cure

Who wants to be alone in this world?
You look around and all you see is hurt
But the light - it always guides us
If we move with a little trust

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow

A diamond don't define what shine is
I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is
You got yours; let me find what mine is
I'm a survivor; look how strong my mind is
I stand on my own; it's all me
Regardless of whatever they call me

I'm a leader, not a follower
And I'd rather be paid and popular
Ride, homey, get your dollars up

It's the end of the world as we know it

Nelly Furtado,"I looked at your face
I saw that all the love had died
I saw that we had forgotten to take the time

I, I saw that you couldn't care less about what you do
You couldn't care less about the lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

We forgot about love
We forgot about faith
We forgot about trust
We forgot about us

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You say, 'baby, it's the end of the day.'

We gave a lot
But it wasn't enough
We got so tired
That we just gave up

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn't respect it
We went and neglected it
We didn't deserve it
But I never expected this

Our love floated out the window
Our love floated out the back door
Our love floated up in the sky
To heaven, it's part of a plan
It's back in God's hands, back in God's hands

Oh, it didn't last, it's a thing of the past
No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
Oh, I want it back, just what we had
I want it back, oh, just what we had",In God's Hands

Nelly Furtado,"Am I throwing you off?
Nope!
Didn't think so
How ya doing young lady
The feeling that you gave me really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on your trunk
I was at a loss of words
First time that we spoke

If your looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you looking for her in the day time in the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand

I'll be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you, you seem so loose

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
You ready?

Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kind a cute

Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come too

I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas
Last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine's down

I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I may need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else.

Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go

What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

Bring that on?
You know what I mean

Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Is it the truth, are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And its you that I want
Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait

You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

We're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more",Promiscuous
Nelly Furtado,"In the day
In the night
Say it right
Say it all
You either got it
Or you don't
You either stand or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

I can't say that, I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that, I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that, I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonight you tonight

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

From my hands, I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body, I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really want to go?",Say It Right
Nelly Furtado,"Put on your best clothes
We've been waiting too long for this moment
I'll put on my best smile
I'm shining inside, and I'm proud of our love, but
Every time I turn around
You say that you're not checking for love in that way
But every time I come around you seem
So ready for this

Show time, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action; show what we're about 'cause it's
Show time; our love's breaking out
Let's show the world you're my boy
I'm your girl 'cause it's
Show time; our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action; let it all hang out
'Cause it's show time
Yeah, our time is now
Let's show the world you're my boy
I'm your girl

Let's break a leg out there
This could be the start of the rest of our lives
I've got so much to share
And I'm ready to put it all out there for you
But every time I turn around you seem
So afraid of what people might say
But can't you see it's a game they play
Trying to cast a shadow on our love

I wanna love you when I want
Want to love you where I want to
Wanna touch you when I wanna
Wanna kiss you when I wanna, baby

Nelly Furtado,"I've been high I've been low
I've been fast I've been slow
I've had nowhere to go
Missed the bus missed the show
I've been down on my luck
I've felt like giving up
My life locked in a trunk
When it hurt way too much
I needed a reason to live
Some love inside me to give
I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching

Te busqué de bajo de las piedras y no te encontré
En la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
Hasta enloquecer
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz
Sanando las heridas de mi corazón
Haciendo me sentir vivo otra vez

I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat
Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings
I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future
In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure
I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right
I needed an answer to end all my searching

Te busqué de bajo de las piedras y no te encontré
En la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
Hasta enloquecer
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz
Sanando las heridas de mi corazón
Haciendo me sentir vivo otra vez

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her
I ache for the earth
I stop going to church
I see God in the trees makes me fall on my knees
My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling
My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge
It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes
'Cause they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry

Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey, Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

Bring that on, you know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are

You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

Looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

[N:] You expect me to let you just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it

All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand

I be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

Nelly Furtado,"I looked at your face I saw that all the love had died
I saw that we had forgotten to take the time
I, I saw that you couldn't care less about what you do
You couldn't care less about the lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

We forgot about love
We forgot about faith
We forgot about trust
We forgot about us

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky in Heaven
Where it began back in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You said, ""Baby, it's the end of the day""
And we gave a lot but it wasn't enough
And we got so tired that we just gave up

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky in Heaven
Where it began back in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn't respect it
We went and neglected it
We didn't deserve it
But I never expected this

Our love floated out the window
Our love floated out the back door
Our love floated up in the sky to Heaven
It's part of a plan, it's back in God's hands
Back in God's hands

Oh, it didn't last, it's a thing of the past
No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
Oh, I want it back, just what we had
I want it back, oh, just what we had
",En Las Manos de Dios
Nelly Furtado,"What they say what they say what they say

You speak out all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
'Cause this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well hereÂ´s looking to yourself and no other
WeÂ´re all searching for that special something
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay 'cause youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay youÂ´ll soon get strong enough
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay cuz youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
YouÂ´re going to break
So please donÂ´t do it

You wanna spread your wings but youÂ´re not sure
DonÂ´t wanna leave your comforts
Wanna find a cure
WeÂ´re afraid of who we see in the mirror
We wanna let got but it feels too pure
Who wants to be alone in this world
You look around and all you see is hurt
But the light it always guides us
If we move with a little trust

A diamond donÂ´t define what shine is
I donÂ´t need a Rolex to know what the time is
You got your let me find what mine is
IÂ´m a survivor look how strong my mind is
I stand on my own itÂ´s all me
Regardless of whatever they call me

IÂ´m a leader not a follower
And IÂ´d rather be paid and popular
Ride homie get your dollars up
WeÂ´re in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us",Afraid [DVD]

Could you speak up and stop the mumbling
I don't think you're getting clear.
Sitting on the top it's hard to hear you from way up here.
I saw you tryin to act cute on tv just let me clear the air.
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn that's right, you wasn't there.
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi it it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it.
So if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way

Nelly Furtado,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Hablando en alta voz
Hieres mi corazón
Yo, tratando de escuchar
No me puedo explicar
Qué extraía sensación

Tu no me quieres entender
Y me mandas a callar diciéndome
No me debo sorprender
Porque así es la realidad
De nuestro amor

Y yo
No tengo armas para enfrentarte
Pongo mis manos, manos al aire
Solo me importa amarte
En cuerpo y alma como era ayer

Tu que perdiste el control
Te dejaste llevar
Por la inseguridad
Yo que te he visto crecer
Me puedo imaginar
Que todo cambiara

Hoy aunque todo siga igual
Y me mandes a callar diciéndome
Que tienes que dominar
O será el final
Y yo no puedo así

No tengo armas para enfrentarte
Pongo mis manos, manos al aire
Solo me importa amarte
En cuerpo y alma como era ayer",Manos al Aire

Aha Nelly
Aha La Mala, yeah

Hay algo que va a suceder, no sé que es
Se desprende toda sensación que no puedo ver
Será que el sol esta brillando distinto a lo acostumbrado
En la mañana, esta mañana

Lo que antes me afectaba ya no me dice tanto
Alguien quien alguna vez ame se ha ido borrando
Será la vida que sé yo
Casualidad pensé en mi voz
Te fui llamando llamando

Seré yo o serás tu
Todo está tan diferente eres tu
Seré yo o serás tu
Todo parece puesto bajo otra luz

No supe que es que llegue a este momento
Donde escucho el tono de tu voz y voy corriendo
Será que estoy enamorándome sin querer
No sé bien no sé bien

El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste

Nene puedo saltar al vació
Y liberarme de lo que se supone que es mío
Lo miro eternamente en un cono molido
Sin reparar en la lucha que existe más

Bajo otra luz me encuentro
Y es difícil de olvidarme
De que vine y quedarme
Sin temor a enamorarme
Y allegando como semilla que busca calor

Seré yo o serás tu
Todo está tan diferente eres tu
Seré yo o serás tu
Todo parece puesto bajo otra luz

Déjalo conmigo déjame el olvido
Que yo en mi camino seguiré

Siendo fuerte
Que me importa lo que digan
Lo que piense tanta gente (fuerte)
Si tu crees que tu puedes
No escuches las dudas sigue siendo fuerte (siendo fuerte)
Muéstrate indiferente
Ante lo oscuro y el miedo (fuerte)
Cuando busques el consuelo
Recuerda el valor es lo primero

No quiero llorar
No quiero sufrir no quiero pensar
Me hará recordar que yo te perdí 
Tan lejos de mi haz ido a parar, ah

Un poco de ti, un poco de mí
Dejará de hablar de comunicar
No pude encontrar palabras de amor
Y no alcance amar

Déjalo conmigo déjame el olvido
Porque así consigo salvar mi dignidad
Déjalo conmigo déjame el olvido
Que yo en mi camino seguiré

Siendo fuerte
Que me importa lo que digan

Ese que no puedo esconder
De mi ilusión y mis anhelos
Quizás de mi forma de ser

Y me pregunto si­ poder dejarte ir
Por qué te quiero retener
Haces mi vida sonreír porque yo sé
Que tu eres para mí

Solo sé que tu amor
Me ha devuelto a mi ser
La esperanza la voz 
Y el color y la fe
Tu sorpresa me dio el destino

Y ha parado el dolor
Cuando me sentí perdida
Eres mi sol en la obscuridad
Y ahora quiero volar
Porque tu vuelas conmigo
Ser feliz es todo mi plan

Tus ojos cambian como el cielo
Mi boca se antoja tu piel
Cuando jugamos con el fuego
De noche hasta al amanecer
Y sé muy bien que no poder dejarte ir
Porque de ti me enamore

Solo sé que tu amor
Me ha devuelto a mi ser
La esperanza la voz
Y el color y la fe

Nelly Furtado,"Aire, viento y en mi alma
El fuego se ahoga y solo queda el frió
Sin decir ""no"", y a paso muy lento
Llevo débil el brazo de un tormento

Si tu no estás aquí
No hay manera de existir
Tengo que despertar
Tengo que revivir
Es un inmenso vació
Ya no hay amor aquí
Tal vez no te borre en mi
Y sufrir en silencio
Silencio, silencio, silencio

Antes el sol era mi bendición
Ahora sus rayos me queman sin razón
Antes creía sin dudar en mi instinto
Ahora es tan frágil como un animal herido

Si tu no estas aquí
No hay manera de existir
Tengo que despertar
Tengo que revivir
Es un inmenso vació
Ya no hay amor aquí
Tal vez no te borre en mi

Donde el sol no duerme mas
Y el alma libre va
Yo te esperare
Y será hasta la eternidad

Nelly Furtado,"Es difícil andar en este mundo
Siempre mirando a mis pies
Ignorando que en cada segundo 
Algo a dejado de ser

Es difícil borrar este momento
Porque yo he visto nacer
En tus ojos la estrella en el cielo 
Que me dice a lo lejos que hacer

Vivir es parte de un sueño 
A veces grande o pequeño
Hacen que el mundo sea eterno
Burlando el miedo y el tiempo
Todo ha empezado en un sueño

Cuando el día termina en silencio 
A mi almohada le cuento el dolor
Que mis lagrimas llevan por dentro
Como espejo reflejar mi voz

Vivir es parte de un sueño 
A veces grande o pequeño
Hacen que el mundo sea eterno
Burlando el miedo y el tiempo
Todo ha empezado en un sueño

Ooh ooh
Sonar es la libertad de aquel 
Que ha tocado el cielo
Sin saber volar

Nelly Furtado,"Siete menos veinte desperté
Al abrir los ojos encontré
Un monten de cosas por hacer
Cuando al empezar me pregunté
La casa virada al revés
Los platos al piso yo no sé
La niña en la escuela llevaré
Un poquito tarde ya lo sé

Es uno de esos días que no pasan más
Que en vez de 24 horas quieren 100
Para arreglarlo todo y dejar de querer también

Si suficiente nos fuera el tiempo
Yo te amaría constantemente

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Desorganizada me sentí corriendo por toda la ciudad
No me alcanza el tiempo yo pensé ni para una tasa de café
Quisiera besarle cada vez que viene a mi mente yo no sé
Como poder amarlo sin tener en mi vida nada para él

Si suficiente nos fuera el tiempo

Solo sé, que al verte algo en mi despierto

Quiero quedarme junto a ti
Puede ser cualquier estación
Es como una vacación

La la la la la la la la la

Porque fue, que nuestros caminos llegaron al arder
Y tal vez quiera caminar al reverse 
Eso fue, en mi pasado algo que pregunte
Y llore aquí­ me tienes

Solo quiero acercarme un poco
Mirarte a los ojos
Saber que para ti también todo cambio
Hay algo en tu mirada que me tiene enamorada
Solo quiero quedarme a tu lado y descansar

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You say, 'baby, it's the end of the day.'

You're in every breath that I breathe.
And every step forward that I take
And then I take a step backwards

You're a part of me.
You're in every song that I sing
And every bird that sings to me.
And this is what I dream to be real.

Everyone could be yours
But they're not.

And all this lost

And this is what I dream to be real.
This is my reality.

Because my heart is a lonely hunter 
Dying to strike out.
Grabbed you into my world
When you didn't even ask,
But you always knew 
That you had a past.

You're a part of me.
You're in every breath that I breathe.
And every step forward that I take
And then I take a step backwards
When I don't see your face?
You're a part of me.
You're in every song that I sing
And every word that speaks to me.
And this is what I believe to be real.
This is my reality.

And I live in this sea.

Nelly Furtado,"Oh oh, oh oh
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no

You liked me 'til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
Well I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you

Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day 
I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it?s a lot of yearning

Your face, the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about

It's so much easier to stay down there 
Guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself 
Trying to break through

Than to burn in the spotlight
Turn in the spitfire
Scream without making a sound
Be up here and not looking down 
Because we?re all afraid of heights

Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself

Time to be with you
You were always there but I never cared
Until you went away
Thinking back to then
What I should have done
To show you my love
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

[Chorus]
Are you gonna be OK?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be OK?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming

You were always mine then there came a time
You needed to be free
I didn't understand it wasn't in the plans
But I let you be
They say that if they love you and you let them go
They'll fly back one day
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

[Chorus]

You always were so carefree in your way
You never let it get to you that way
And now you are so far
You're so far away
I hope you know what to do
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you

Looking at the right side
This is the last light
At the end of the day

You’re on a long flight
Taking your last bite
Of the good life before it goes away

Where’d you go, oh where’d you go my friends, my friends?
You said you would be there till the end, the end
Knock you down you get back up again, again
And when they run after you
You just run from them

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?
Where are all the believers?
Where are all of the healers?
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray?

This is the right time
Baby to be mine
And taste the good life
Before it goes away

Knock me down I get back up again, again
And if they run after me
I’ll just run from them

Jump out an airplane with a parachute
Fly up and away on a hot air balloon

If this is it then baby why aren't I on your shoulder

I want you to be mine

And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and

Try every sport until you score a goal
Follow the path of a butterfly
Go to Ground Zero and do nothing but cry

I see it’s worth the fight

Strap on my boots
Look around to see which weapons I’ll choose

It may look good from the outside
But all I really wanted was a good life
With a memory reel of all the highlights
All I want is to sleep good at night
Look myself in the mirror knowing that I live right
So when I'm six feet in the ground
I'll be singing like

A million dollars in palm
Not a worry in the world, that's everything I want
I'm wishing I was there I feel like it's where I belong
I wanna be able to go pay all the bills for my mom
And make her smile
Pick up my family and take em out
On me
And my over capacitated bank account
Money is all I think about
Of my life it's a highlight
Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life
Look at me now
Look at how I get down
Stubs and Wooten on my feet
I'm the flyest youngin in town
But I'm loosin it
My vision has just become an illusion
And Now my highlife is low again
Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission
And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions
I know it's not the end Well then again it might be
And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me

And now I'm singing like

I've got chains on my feet but not in my mind 
I'll be dancing all day see the sun outside

A body that's a miracle

A heart that was made pure 
Unbreakable and that's for sure 
Unshakeable so give me more

With a meditation I erase my pain

You'll never break you'll never break

Because we’re not allowed
To show how we feel

In here it's warm and dry
Got feelings that I've got to try expressing
Like a language that I share with you
Let's talk in the special way we do
Don't want to be anywhere else but here with you
Feels so good

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

Baby I know it's late
We've got decisions to make
Think of what we could create together
And with you I am never afraid
To play with the highest stakes
Nobody could break my rapture

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

I can't control it in the night, night, night
It's when I've got you on my mind, mind, mind
Cuz you're the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye
I've got to get you in my life, life, life
Can't think of nothing worse than being lonely
I think you're the right choice for one and only
We're running out of time so baby hold me
Days go by

You'll have a prize in your hand when you walk away
Let it slip through your fingers and you'll never know
What winning's really like, oh
I stayed there too long, now it's in my soul
And when the thunder rolls, I got nowhere to go
I keep going round on this carousel
Because it spins me so well
And I'll stay with you just a little while
There's so much for us to see and do

But don't mistake this for an adventure in paradise
Just because the rides look so good

Carnival games are so much fun to play, hard to just walk away from
And all you want, a pretty thing but the price you pay is
Always too much, you'll never dry up these tears
Crying from all the years playing carnival games

Do you know which way to look, all the shining lights
And your name on the postcard of your life
And everyone will say that you came to conquer
Yeah, you won the whole race

But don't mistake this for an adventure in paradise
Just because the rides look so good

I wanna shed all of my skin, feel my blood as it takes the wind
I don't know where to begin

Carnival games are so much fun to play, hard to just walk away
When all you want are pretty, pretty things
You can't walk away once you play the game
You can't get back what you paid from all the years

Feeling your presence hovering, hovering, hovering
Time that I finally say something, something, something
You're not gonna take this one lie down

And the cold hard truth I've been waiting, I'm waiting
And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone, alone, laying low

Making me feel so alive

Nelly Furtado,"Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live with you through everything
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live in a kaleidoscope
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
Wanna be the one to spin the wheel

I know that we can only give
When we have hope
I don't wanna live
Without any goals
Can't protect me from nothing
Can't save me from the truth
You can't even save me from you

So don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna feel the good and bad in everything
Even when it hurts, even when it hurts

I know that we can only give
When we got a little hope
But I don't like the burden
Of living with these ghosts
Yes, I will hold my head high
When I walk in your parade
But I will always check my gait
I will always watch my gait

Let me tap dance for you

Over all the marks on the floor
Pretending that I might be something more than a smile
I'm tap dancing
Maybe I'm asking for too much
Maybe I should just give it up for a while

And let the curtain fall
And face the ugly
I shouldn't have to dance at all
For you to love me

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Seems like forever that she's been on my mind,
But nothing has changed;
She thinks I'm a waste of her time.
There she goes; she don't know what she's missing.
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight?
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire.
I'm on the outside lookin' in
Let me into your heart - oh,
There's nothing on Earth that
Should keep us apart.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone,
'Cause I can't live without your love.
So I wait, here for an answer,
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday.

Or the outline of your silhouette when you step into the light.
Is it in the things you say or the message in your eyes?

But now I feel like giving in,
And I know what's to blame.
It's just desire burning up my heart.
I never want to let this feeling go.
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you

I feel like there's a spell on me
That words just can't describe.
It hit me like a ton of bricks,
Right between the eyes.
I swore I'd never take the fall.
Now I'm hanging on the edge.
Could you be my destiny
Or something I'll regret?

I ain't hungry for no lasting thing.

But now the ties are broken;
I'm crashing to the ground.
Can't you see?  My heart's in bits and pieces.
It comes as no surprise, after all your lies.
I was a fool to believe in those empty tears you cried.
How long was it going on?
Could it be you were deceiving me right from the start?
I'll never forget the
Day I came back just to find you in someone
Else's arms.
I let the passion blind me when the truth was plain to see.
You made the chains that bind me, and I just can't break free.

It comes as no surprise, after all your lies.
I was a fool to believe in those empty tears you cried.
Oh, can't you see our love's in bits and pieces?

Decided it's impossible to keep you satisfied

And now I'm speaking in tongues, lying to the mirror

Before you take that five o'clock plane, that's leaving
I'm so tired of tryin' to count eight, nine, ten ways I'll be dyin'
If you should take that five o'clock plane, hey, hey

Someday, baby one day
As we reminisce we'll laugh at all this hearsay
Someday, maybe one day
You'll apologize when you've realized
I never lied to you anyway

Will I, just be a footnote on forever?
Testify before you bury all our treasure

Are we one or two far gone to say three words, ""I love you""
Before you take that five o'clock plane, that's leaving
I'm so tired of tryin' to count eight, nine, ten ways I'll be dyin'
If you should take that five o'clock plane, hey, hey
Before you take that five o'clock plane

All those nights we held each other
Body, mind and soul
I can't believe you'd ever let that go

Are we one or two far gone to say three words, ""I love you""
Before you take that five o'clock plane, that's leaving

Nelson,"(Look up) There`s no man on the moon tonight 
Guess he`s turned his back on me (once again) 
The wicked walls of this dead-end town are closing in and I can`t breathe 
(Sail away) Down the river of shattered dreams; 
My destiny`s disguised (but I will find it) 
Empty promises flow my way, adrift in shame; do you feel the same? 

[Chorus]
Another time, another place we won`t be prisoners of fate 
Somehow, we`ll find a way to get out of here 
Oh, why don`t we make the great escape and set our sites on higher ground? 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side 

(Step inside) See the man with the cracked guitar 
Selling tales of sonic gray (the skies are falling) 
No one gathers to sympathize or pay tribute to his fading flame 
Tattoo girl on a butterfly 
Sowing seeds of boundless hope (and devotion) 
Follow me through a leap of faith; I know the way, I heard her say 

[Chorus]
 
I know why you cry 
Just let go; it`s easy if you try 

Another time, another place we won`t be prisoners of fate 
Somehow, we`ll find a way to get out of here 
Oh, why don`t we make the great escape and set our sites on higher ground? 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side. Whoa, yeah! 
We`ve got to make the great escape and leave behind what can`t be saved 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side

Come on, come on, come on and take my hand.

Don`t look back",The Great Escape
Nelson,"Looking back on a girl I knew 
Whose smile and laughter carried me through 
Oh, the way that I felt when she looked at me that way 

When I heard she was gone I had no one to hold 
I wept as I felt my heart growin' cold 
Like Poppa she taught me there's no time like today 
...I hear her saying 

Chorus: 
Love me today, and let my strength be your own 
Love me today, because tomorrow I'll be gone 
When I feel it's time to go - I'll be on my way 
So love me today 

I remember a time back when 
Poppa would laugh as I held his hand 
And just one embrace would make my troubles pass 

I thought those times would never end 
The day that he left he smiled and he said, 
I'll be home soon but Poppa never came back... 
I hear him saying 

Don't be afraid to say, ""I love you"" 
Take the moment and make it last 
‘Cause if you don't tell them you love them 
You might not get a second chance 
...So hear them saying

Nelson,"Your first hello, the darkness is broken 
You're scared, I know, the wheels are in motion 
It's opening night for the show of your lifetime, my friend 
The days roll by, you live for tomorrow 
Against the tide, in an ocean of sorrow 
Well, is it all worth it if nobody wins in the end? 

We learn as a child to carry the pain and hide it away in the dark 
We've all lived this charade, but I don't want to play anymore 

Give me love for the rest of my life 
Give me hope for the rest of my days 
I'm tired of watching the world slip away 
There's one thing you must understand 
When there's no forgiveness then nobody wins in the end 

You've come of age (you're a slave), a slave and a soldier 
You fight the rage (every day), but you heart's growing colder 
You're starting to wonder if nobody wins in the end 
You know, I'd rather die than keep living the lie we've become 

I want to break free! I won't let these fools hold me down! 
I'm gonna spread my wings and fly 

It's time to go, the curtain is falling 
The final show, a new play is calling 
Just one thing to give you; take it or leave it, my friend 
If we don't come together, then nobody wins in the end",Nobody Wins in the End
Nelson,"Come on over, now don`t be shy 
All your stars and your planets are `bout to align 
Why not surrender to the gleam in my eyes? 
Come and get it, before it dies 

Afraid to take a chance

Gather up your fears and let `em go 
That`s over now, that`s over now 
 
I`ll be your friend when you need one to turn to 
Call out my name and I`ll always be there 
Wherever you go just remember I love you 
Whenever you start to feel the pain 
I`m only a moment away 

Dust off the ashes and take my hand 
I will pull you away from the quick in the sand 
Tonight is the night we reach the promised land 
When you whisper that I`m your man 

You`re clinging to the past 
Scared to go too far too fast 
Nothing`s gonna change `till you let go 
I`ll show you how, I`ll show you how 

I`ll be your friend when you need one to turn to 
Call out my name and I`ll always be there 
Wherever you go just remember I love you

Nelson,"Can you hear me? Are you there?
I need a friend to lend an ear
A million miles on my bones
I'm a child but I feel so old
Whoa I, I once had faith that guided me
But I, I've paid a price for my beliefs

Now I need some peace on earth
Can you heal my heartache? Can you save my soul?
I'm loking for some peace on earth
I swear once I've found you, I'll never let you go

Through the years, I've walked alone
Guess I've finally reached the end of my road
Faced the fears, felt the rage
Up to now I've lived my life a crying clown inside a cage
Whoa I, I think I've lost my will to be
But I, I hear you calling out to me

Will you be my peace on earth?
Will you heal my heartache, will you save my soul?
I'm looking for peace on earth
I swear once I've found you, I'll never let you go

I'd give all I've got just to find
Somebody to love me, to stay by my side
Then I'd know that come heaven or hell
Everything's gonna be alright

You are my peace on earth
You healed my heartache, saved my soul
You've given me peace on earth
And now that I've found you I won't let you go
You are my peace on earth, peace on earth
You give me peace on earth, I wanted you to know
That it's thanks to you that I'm finally coming home",Peace on Earth
Nelson,"Do you think it`s all over? 
Do you feel your life is like a lover that`s turned their back on you? 
Are you runnin` for cover? 
Does a day go by that you`re not-a-wishin` that you could start anew? 
I hear you! Alright! 

So you feel a little jaded? 
Do you find your dreams have all been traded for a grownup point of view? 
Have your memories faded? 
Did you forget how you always swore you`d make it? 
Well, why is life now living you? 

So many days I`d waste away 
Let my dismay consume and bind me 
Now here I stand, a liberated man 
I took command by taking it easy 

They say you ain`t got it, but don`t you believe it 
They pray that you`ll fall in line 
Within your reflection discover perfection 
Don`t fall for the loveless lies 
The one to believe in is right before your eyes 

What they sell, are you buyin`? 
Do I come off like another pitchman lyin`? 
Well, who can you believe? 
You might think you`re dyin`... 
Is what you feel just the child in your heart a-cryin` 
For you to set it free? Oh! 

We`re bought and sold, taught lust for gold 
Trade youth for old schoold blind ambition 
But if you slow it down and take a look around 
You won`t believe what you`ve been missing 

What`s family honor? 
Did you faithfully bow down and allow your father 
To steal your sense of pride? 
Or was it your momma? 
Has she treated you like you`ve been her little trauma 
Since the day the rabbit died? 
I hear you! Oh, yeah! 

They say you ain`t got it, don`t you believe it 
You`ve been chasing a waste of time 
It`s in your reflection, a shining perfection

Nelson,"Though I try, I can't decide 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 

The tears pour down in the nights spent awake 
Salvation in sleep always seems to escape 
I look down at your picture in pieces thrown across my room 
The future was hidden in the cards we were dealt 
How could you cheat on the love that I felt? 
I sink my head in my pillow, confused about what I'll do about you 

Though I try, I can't decide 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 
Can't you see what you mean to me 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 

I can't see an end to the pain that I'm in 
The alibis you handed me seemed mighty thin 
Clear the lump from my throat, read your letter just one more time 
I haven't been asleep for a week 'cause it seems 
That I can't close my eyes, you're there in my dreams 
I throw your number in the trash, confused about what I'll do about you 

Addicted to your love like a martyr is to pain 
Like a sinner craves a vice and a drug need a vein 
Am I giving you the blade and begging you to run me through? 
Well, I'm the type of man who believes in the fight 
I know what is wrong and I'd die for what's right 
I'll make you understand if it's the last thing I do 
Whoa, that I love you 

No, I just can't walk away, walk away from you

Nelson,"So you think you`ll take another piece of me 
To satisfy you`re intellectual needs?

Liar (liar) Liar (liar) - You know you believe it 
Higher (higher) Higher (higher) - 'cause I`m the main man

And that`s why everyone wants a piece of the action

Hey, let's start a holy war!

[Chorus:]
Do you believe in religion? 
I believe it's your decision 
Do you think it makes a difference? 
Is it just some man-made vision?

Do you really care anyway? 

Midnight preacher calls me a sinner 
And maybe he's right 
He said he's just used the hot line 
And God's got a message for me 
He says 
He condemns my situation, if I want to find salvation 
It's time to phone in my donation as a vow of faith 
He tells me that the church has got an image to protect 
And God wants me to give, give 'til it hurts 

Stayed me hand, it's just as well 
They caught him using God's tax-free cash 
To feed the kitty in some cheap motel 
And now he's going to Hell 

[Chorus x 2]",Do You Believe in Religion?
Nelson,"You led me on and took me in 
Behind the veil but never again 
Will I ever betray myself surrender to a savior`s hell 

For seven years I`d trust in you 
My innocence I gave to you 
You`d turn upon this gentle soul 
Destroy naivety and hope 

The day I found the Judas Mirror 
Shades of gray turned crystal clear and 
I could see for miles and miles 
Your betrayals and my denials 

I swore allegiance to the flag - 
Then bore your judgements on my back 
As sign 'em up and rob 'em blind 
Became modus operandi 

Battered, bleeding, bruised of heart - 
My self-esteem you tore apart 
Then spoke to me with forked tongue 
My game you threw and swore I`d won 

Reflections in the Judas Mirror 
Everything revealed so clearly 
Steal a look at times gone by 
And spitting out my last good-bye 

Well I won`t live in apathy, embittered by the memories 
You haven`t seen the last of me 
Never, I`ll never - pass your way again 

I`m stunned you sleep with you each night - 
An incubating parasite 
When daylight shines through your disguise 
The truth will lead to your demise",The Judas Mirror
Nelson,"You had me right in the palm of your hand
Gave you my soul, I was at your command
You had control,
How, I don't understand but it's over now

Trusted your promises, believed your lies
How you tortured me slowly with your cheap alibis
I can finally let go now that I know what you're all about

So I'll always be glad you'd forget to forgive
When you leave
Make the aftertaste of love
Turned to hate bittersweet memories
I'm begging you please

[Chorus:]
Just kiss me when I cry
A taste of pretty poison to remember you by
Say you love me, then tell me good-bye
Shoot me through the heart
And then kiss me when I cry

You bled me dry with your vicious demands
To steal my soul was a part of your plans
Your only happiness is breaking a man,
But it's over now

Use sex extortion and insatiable greed
How you'd stand there laughing after cutting me deep
You nearly killed me, never fulfilled me,
That's what you're all about

Since my pain is your pleasure
Take me down one last time
In your typical style you could kill me then smile
Hit me with a parting shot, leave me behind

Salt and cyanide just don't mix
The tears will dry but remember this
I'll never make the same damn mistake
So come, seal your fate with one fatal kiss

(Low down) Won't stop 'til I beg and I plead 
(She gets down) I need to walk on the wilder side 
So my girl gets down on me

Lurking in my darker side 
Fantasies torture me, strange perversities

And my mistress holds the key 

[Chorus]

(She gets down) My girl tames the monster in me 
(Low down) She knows how to give what I need 
(She gets down) She controls my sexual greed 
So I let my girl get down on me 

I get my pleasure from the pain

What would the neighbors say? 

(Hurts so good) 
""Are you ready for me senator?"" 
""Yes Mistress.""

But she'd leave him thirsty 

If you only knew what you're missing 
You'd walk through fire for me 
I try to tell you baby, you won't listen

Sooner or later I'm making you mine 
You're gonna love me in a matter of time 
There's no use runnin' babe, you just can't hide 
'Cause sooner or later you're mine 

Decided I'd had enough of walking the wire 
So I finally found the guts to admit my desire 
When I confessed 
How much I craved her love and affection 
I was paralyzed by the shock of a cold rejection 

I'd give all that I have to own you 
But you don't care I'm alive 
You won't surrender, I can't control you 
Well, here's the bottom line 

[Chorus]

I've been looking for a lover who can satisfy me 
Come and slide under the covers 
I've got you where I want you 
And you got me where you want me 
Baby, tell me, do you like what you see?

I've been waiting for your kiss 
Still I lie here at night as I think of the things I miss

I know for sure this chapter's over
I'll never more see my reflection in her loving eyes

When opposites attract to me
The flame burns uncontrollably but soon the fire dies
But I'm not sure what I'm asking for,
Why if I want love, do I beg for more?

Guess we always want what we can't get
Love just strikes us blind
But in the end, we always get what we can't want
You'd have thought we'd have learned
But we fall for it every time

It turns me on if she's unreachable or dangerous
When what I need and what I lust
Are completely different things
How many times have I let love slip through my fingers
Chasing after promises I know will never keep?

But I don't know why I can't let go
When my heart says yes
But my mind screams no

I've been looking all my life for answers
Questions of the heart I've got to ask her
Does she exist or does she not? I wonder...
And so my search for her goes on and on and on

Blocking clinics in a human chain

And on the news i find it's all been spent

MTV, sporty car, snappy clothes and Visa card

As April fades into December
It'd do us all good to remember
Even the dinosaurs couldn't give fate the slip
Yes my friends, the bottoming is we've got
The dumb leading the deaf and blind
We're fresh out of parachutes
And we're headed for the edge of a cliff

Look at us kids and all we deal with today
We love in fear 'cause of some monkey's disease
And 'cause our parents let the rainforests die
In twenty years, the sun will boil the seas
And Mr. President don't give a shit
Says, ""hallelujah, the recession's gone!""
He spends a tril to keep the Commies away
When there's a thousand homeless

Well, little miss spider, you can get out and gone

Hypnotized by the lies of a true believer

Nelson,"It was right from the start 
So I surrendered the key to my heart 
I was sure we couldn't miss 
But now I taste something strange in your kiss 

People are talkin' lately sayin' you've been messin' around 
I don't want to believe it baby, but it's all over town 

They tell me you've got the devil in your soul 
Say it isn't so that I'm the very last to know

It was hot - like a hundred degrees in the shade 
Tell me now - what do I do 
If I find that you lied when I trusted in you? 

Did you try to deceive me? Did you baby? 
Or are you misunderstood? 
You could sell me a story - maybe 
But you better make it good

(Oh, no, no, you can't fool me, baby) 

You can't hide your lyin' eyes - I gotta big surprise for you 
(Girl you're gonna get it) 
I found out what you're all about - you can scream and shout 
(But I think you might regret it) 
I'm gonna give you one more chance

Nelson,"A painted promise - a smokescreen dream
It wasn't all we thought it'd be
A fortune made - when we betrayed
The faith we'd placed in our blind belief

We were once close as blood
Yeah...
Locked inside - pride's prison cells
Separately suffering for our sins
Well, the seasons changed - but the chill remains
A karmic debt keeps us Siamese twins

Until it's said, nothings done

The silence is broken
And that we have spoken
Don't turn away
I know we can change

A quickening - a bitter end
Come what may, something must be said
This reckoning - should be deafening
Instead of pregnant tranquility

The rebirth has begun

Emancipation lives and breathes
In the words one should but never speaks
Communication can end this speculation
And if we fall then at least we'll go down screaming!

She's sugar and spice, she's naughty and nice

Strut your stuff in that lingerie 
That's right, pretty mama

Bump it, grind it, blow me a kiss

You could make a grown man cry 
You're in control of every man 
Your every wish is my command 

If Calamity Jane doesn't drive me insane 
Nurse Nympho is sure to please 
Then Little Annie Fannie's gonna rock me to my knees

Keep this up and I'll blow my lid 
You make me explode when you do that sunset strip

Oh baby, bring on those dancing girls 
Yeah, we're all gonna leave here broke, drunk, and horny 
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!

I can't fight this feeling 
Lying in my cold, dark room alone 

In a dream I see your face 
You say you're never leaving 
Then I wake up to find you`re gone 

Now, I know it's true 
That only you can stop these 

Tears of pain running down my face 
I'll never be the same 
Will I make it through another night? 
You left and tore my soul apart 
Now, nothing else remains but tears of pain 

Here in my memories 
We will last forever 
It seems so close I can almost taste your love 

If I must go down this endless road with you 
I'll just lose control 
And I'd break every rule 

For one more chance at you 
'Cause only you can stop these 

Tears of pain running down my face 
I'll never be the same 
Will I make it through another night? 
You left and tore my soul apart 
Now, nothing else remains but tears of pain 

Whoa, tears of pain running down my face 
I'll never be the same 
Will I make it through another night?

Nelson,"You're a mattress - you're a bees nest 
You are heroin in an armored vest 
You're a plane crash - you are white trash

You're a cartoon - you're a bastard moon 
You're the feathered throat that brought Rome to ruin 
You're a sunburn - you are milk turned 
You were Sunday - schooled, but you never learned 
So why oh why am I still in love with you? 

And we danced to the sounds of Taj Mahal 
And then the alarm clock rang and shook me from the ball

Why a girl like you should want a boy like me
You can try, but you'll fail to derail my one track mind

I wasn't raised to come on like this 
Unsatisfied with your goodnight kissin'; listen, I've been cool 
But, baby, it's high time we went to school 

Oh, you talk too much; just give it a rest 
After all this time, it doesn't make much sense 
That I gotta take your word we ain't in no rush 
One more night and a lame excuse 
Ain't gonna change my mind; no, it ain't no use 
I give you my love, and I don't get your magic touch

Tryin' to recover 'cause you saw it my way 
Walkin' two feet off the ground on a hard night's day

And hard days work- yeah, it gives me pride 
And my words are the fuel for the fire inside 
Of the heart that she outgrew like this town here 

Well, if you see my girl in austin, 
Tell her I miss what we lost when 
She walked out the door to return no more 
To the life that she belongs 
And if she's there in amarillo 
'bout that note beneath my pillow? 
Why'd I have to read what I could not see about my ways that rubbed her wrong 
When she was goin', goin', gone?

A heartland girl with uptown eyes 
My old fashioned views missed her disguise 
I'd have never guessed she'd have pawned our love for a pair of walking shoes 
Well, I hope those big plans all work out 
And she makes her name- but I have no doubt 
She'll one day see what it's all about 
Is this life she swore to lose

Nelson,"I've got a million pictures in my heart
And here at home

But I'm afraid that they'll just fade with time
And photographs are cold
And a memory's hard to hold
And I never got the chance to say goodbye

One more day, one more night
One more chance to get it right
A few more words, a few more laughs
Doesn't seem too much to ask

And I know it's just a dream
But I'd give everything
If you'd walk through that door
Just once more

Sometimes I catch myself asking you out loud
What you'd do if you were in my place
'Cause every day in every way
I've tried to make you proud
I wish that I could tell you face to face

One more day, one more night
One more chance to get it right
A few more words, a few more laughs
Doesn't seem too much to ask

And I know it's just a dream
But I'd give everything
If you'd walk through that door
Just once more

Seasons come and seasons go
But love lives on-you taught me so
Oh, I've been blessed, I don't think twice
But wouldn't it be nice

One more day, one more night
One more chance to get it right
A few more words, a few more laughs
Doesn't seem too much to ask

And I know it's just a dream
But I'd give everything
If you'd walk through that door

Does he move like Michael Jackson when she gets him to dance?
Does he sing like Sinatra?
Does he spend like Trump?
What's a queen like that doin' with Forest Gump?
Does he always take the checker at the Indy 5?
Hold some kind of record as the oldest alive?

You call that an ocean? 
To me it's just a pond that's almost dry 
If you want to see an ocean 
You should see the tears her leaving made me cry

So I headed west to see that famous canyon 
That the Colorado cut so deep and wide 
I thought seeing something lower down than I felt 
Might cheer me up and ease my troubled mind 
But I just got disappointed one more time 

You call that a canyon? 
It`s nothing but a pothole in the yard 
If you want to see a canyon 
You should see the hole she left here in my heart

So now I stand here staring at the Rockies 
I've heard they reach right up to heaven's door 
They're like that little hole and that blue puddle 
And I see now what I should have seen before 
Without her life holds no wonders anymore

Would I be the glue when you're comin' undone?
Would I always swear you look much too young?

Would I cut a deal when you're payin' your dues?
Would I vote no on my right to choose?
Would I throw away my walkin' shoes?
I would if you want me to
I would if you want me to

To tell you the truth there ain't no use denying you're my what, when, where and why
Put me to the test and I'll put to rest any doubt in your mind

Would I get real when you're being a fake?
Would I counter every bad move you make?
Would I let you have all the time you could take?

Nelson,"Yesterday a sad goodbye
I told you that it wouldn't be for long
But it seems like a thousand years since I've been gone
Oh, what I'd give to hold you in my arms
Can't you see how much I need you tonight
I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go, I get that feeling
It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go
I get that feeling

Nelson,"I always will remember those sultry desert nights
Our hearts burning with a passion whoa, it's never felt so right
It was meant to last forever but when I reached out you were gone
It's taken time to mend this broken heart and forget you done me wrong

Now you're back after all this time
You've reawakened all the feelings that I've tried so hard to hide
But baby

Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?
That's all I need to know
Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?
Or will you just let me go?

We could leave the pain behind us take a shot at love again
We could fool ourselves believing that our love would never end
I've been missing you whoa, what should I do?
Did you really have a change of heart or are you playing me for a fool?

You don't have to tell me where you've been
But there is one thing I've gotta know before I let you in, baby

Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?
That's all I need to know
Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?
Or will you just let me go?

Come and touch me, like you touched me yesterday
But if you want me girl you gotta let it show
Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?
Or will you just let me go?

Will you love me, like you loved me yesterday?

Nelson Eddy,"When the melancholy shadows fall
My heart is melancholy too
Then I hear the Balalaika's call
And life is gay and bright and new

At the Balalaika
Where there is magic in the sparkling wine,
And mellow music in the candles' shine
I have a rendezvous!
At the Balalaika,
Who knows what ecstasy tonight may bring,
What lovely melody my heart may sing,
Before the night is through,
I hear a violin, a haunting gypsy violin
And when it sighs its strangely tender song
I know that I belong
At the Balalaika
Oh let me linger there till break of day
Where hearts are young and balalaikas play
I have a rendezvous!

There's been a change in me!

Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

It's a kind of a grind of depression.
My heart's acting strangely, it feels rather sore,
At Least, it gives me that impression.
My pulses beat madly without any cause,
Believe me, I'm telling you truly.
I'm gay without pause, then sad without cause,
My spirits are truly unruly.

For I'm falling in love with some one, some one girl.
I'm falling in love with someone head a-whirl,
Yes, I'm falling in love with someone plain to see,
I'm sure I could love someone madly,
If someone would only love me.

A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.",Trees

Nelson Eddy,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Nelson Eddy,"There's a little brown road windin' over the hill
To a little white cot by the sea
There's a little green gate
At whose trellis I wait
While two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

And if ever I'm left in this world all alone
I shall wait for my call patiently
For if Heaven be kind
I shall wait there to find
Those two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me",Smiling' Through
Nelson Flaco Padron,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Nelson Flaco Padron,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Nelson Flaco Padron,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Fazer domingo à tarde
Pois eu quero convidar
Você para sair comigo
Passear por aí numa rua

Vou dizer pra você tanta coisa
Que a ninguém eu digo

Eu não tenho nada pra
Fazer domingo à tarde
Pois domingo é um dia tão
Triste pra quem vive sozinho

Quando eu vejo um casal namorando
É que eu sinto a verdade
É tão triste passar o
Domingo sem ter um carinho

Se você também vive tão só
Sei que vai me entender
Sem amor é muito mais

Nelson Riddle,"A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.",The Green Leaves of Summer
Nelson Riddle,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Nelson Riddle,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues

Nelson Riddle,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?
Nelson Riddle,"It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high, 
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard 
Is throwing his heart at the sky! 

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love. 

[Chorus]
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

Maybe it's more than the moon,
Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you! 

[Chorus]

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow

Nelson Riddle,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to go and play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I
Are just like a couple of tots
Running across a meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm going to feel the way I do today
Because you make me feel so young

Nelson Riddle,"There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Soon, we'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune, and then, 
There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.

Nelson Riddle,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you

Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart

A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
