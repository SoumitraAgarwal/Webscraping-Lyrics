Marissa Nadler,"Every night that I spend alone
You don't know
You don't know me at all
And in my life of a girl
Of the troubles and love
I'm a troubled, troubled heart

Thought I'd sing with the boats
Trouble all away
That they'd swim back to me today
My troubles are never going to leave me alone

A prayer told me
The rosary
That I wear on my neck
Stare out to sea
Ghosts overhead
Bird in a tree
I feel numb and cold, rosary
Numb cold and free, rosary
Rosary",Rosary
Marissa Nadler,"Flowers died a long
Time ago my friend
And they're hanging on the wall
With wax and thread

When you were young
Did you think it would ever end?
When you were young
Did you think it would ever end?

Sylvia was a girl
That I knew best
And she wore the finest
Eyelid dress
And she sits in her room
Painting golden moons
And she sits in her room
Painting golden runes

Oh, what am I to do
Without a man to see me through?
Oh, what am I to do
Without a man to see me through?
I'm more than blue
I'm violet

Lyla met a man
That she loved best
And he died in a fiery crash.

And the hole is wide
The hole is wide
The hole is wide

And the hole is wide
The hole is wide
The hole is wide

Oh, what am I to do
Without a man to see me through?
Oh, what am I to do
Without a man to see me through?
I'm more than blue
I'm violet

Sylvia was a girl that I knew best",The Whole Is Wide
Marissa Nadler,"When you came to town I fell for you it seems
To a house with twisted branches
And a candle dream
I'll be your alabaster queen
Your alabaster queen

When I hear you play
I think of water and sunshine

And I never really mind
All your women wistful wanting
You all the time
I'll be your alabaster queen
Your alabaster queen

Your alabaster queen
And sunshine king",Alabaster Queen
Marissa Nadler,"Where did you go
When the snow fell that year
You were inside these wooden walls
Like a bear
Eager child for the end in your lair
For the end of the year

And that old familiar fear
Creeps up your little arms
And runs through your veins
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs

And then summer came
And he wore you like a charm
And you knew yourself
That what had come
Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in your burrowed hole
You love to be the pawn
Always moving on
 
Oh where did I go
When the rains fell that year
We were inside that wooden house
Like a bear
Eager child for the end to be near
For the end of the year

And then winter came
And I wore him
Like a charm
And we knew that what had come
Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in my burrowed hole
I feel it coming on
Always moving on

An island is always alone
And you were breaking yours with a stone
So I took you home to a bastion
A hurricane by any other name
So I took you home and I crashed you
A hurricane in your veins","In Your Lair, Bear"
Marissa Nadler,"Mr. John Lee what is happening to me
Last time I saw you
Bringing fire wood into your house
From a tree
But I didn't love you
Quite as much
As sweet Marie
The sheriff he never
Had to come
To wade through the water
Swamps
And some strange mystery
To find Marie

Me clad in Velveteen
Red lips and high heeled shoes
I carried you
Your weight for a long time
Through years and towns and took refuge
And I carried your weight upon mine

Marie got married
To a man

And I found your footsteps
In summer lands
To your lady

Marie has a daughter
And a new city now
And your skin is soft and tired
From the years
But your happy now

Me clad in Velveteen
Red lips and high heeled shoes
I carried you
Your weight for a long time
Through years and towns and took refuge
And I carried your weight upon mine

What is happening to me
Last time I saw you
Bringing firewood into your house
From a tree",Mr. John Lee Revisited
Marissa Nadler,"It's a beautiful day
And I went for a walk
But I saw that old dirt path
Where we used to talk
Where is the rain
Cause some spring lovers
Are bringing me down again

The years have come
And your hands have gone
But your land is something
Lost in a song

Why does the sun always remind me of you
Yes it does
I hope a new day will come
And cover up what I done

Why does the sun always remind me of you
I would know
That there ain't nothing but love songs
On the radio

Turn on the colored days
To peel away the skin
The sun will turn my hands to gold
More than any alchemist

Sea water it rounds the edge of shard and turns to sand
I heard you bought a house

And light it up with glass and second hand

Why does the sun always remind me of you
Yes it does
I hope a new day will come
And cover up what I have done
Why does the sun always remind me of you
I would know
That there aint nothing but love songs
On the radio

Always reminds me of you
Yes it does
It always reminds me of you
Yes it does, 
Yes it does, 
Yes it does

Why does the sun always remind me of you
I hope a new day will come
And cover up what I have done
Why does the sun always remind me of you
I hope a new day will come
And cover up what I have done
Why does the sun always remind of you
I would know
That there ain't nothing but love songs

Marit Larsen,"Give me an invitation more than a guess
Give me a sign if only one single breath
I'll give you an empty page
This is the time and place

What kind of truth lives in the absence of trust?
What is the use of holding back on this much?
My eyes are open wide
Won't you let me inside?

Come closer, love
I can't hear what you're saying
Don't make it easy love
All the corners are fraying
How can I please you, love
When I don't know what you want?
It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
I don't think so.

Uuh, how about you tell me what you're doubting us for?
What is wrong with both feet on this side of the door?
There is no easy way I'll be the one who stays

Come closer, love
I can't hear what you're saying
Don't make it easy love
All the corners are fraying
How can I please you, love
When I don't know what you want?
It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
I don't think so.

You're so close to me
You're so far away
I don't know what you mean
You're way out of reach
You're so close to me
You're so far away

Come closer, love
I can't hear what you're saying
Don't make it easy love
All the corners are fraying
Won't you come closer, love
I can't hear what you're saying
How can I please you, love
When I don't know what you want?
It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
(I don't think so)
",Come Closer
Marit Larsen,"You say, we must move forward
And I say, let's not go back
Once we were brave explorers
But this trail is a worn-out track
Don't chase that setting sun
Look what we've become

[Chorus]
Don't save me, I'll save you the hassle
Our little castle is a house of cards
It's empty, heartache is pending
This is us ending

You say, you were just kidding
And I say, this is no joke
We've grown and we're not fitting
We've flamed out to a wisp of smoke
Don't turn the truth around
It reads the same way upside-down

[Chorus]
So don't save me
Don't you dare

Little by little, sneaking upon
Till it's too much to ignore
Let's leave in the middle, before it dead ends
I've been down this road

Don't you dare leave me here
I'll go looking elsewhere!

[Chorus 2x]

So don't save me
Don't you dare
",Don't Save Me
Marit Larsen,"In came the light,
It swallowed me whole
Melted the tracks in the snow
To leave room for the new
To leave room for the new

In came the light
And we started to glow
",In Came the Light
Marit Larsen,"So you say I need to consider this
Yours were the face that I couldn't resist
Yours was the fuel to the flames in my heart
Mine were the words that would tear us apart

Well I say I found the letters you wrote
Mine was the smile and the life that you broke
Mine was the story that you told your friends
Yours were the demons you couldn't defend

Understand me, as of lately I've learned a thing or two
There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you

[Chorus]
'Cause only a fool would do this again
Only a fool would let you back in
There is no you left to embrace
There is no word would make it feel safe
Love was a gift, stubborn and wild
I was armed with the faith of a child
And you were my joy, you were my friend
There is no going back there again

[Chorus 2]
It's more than you can ask of me my love
I'm coming out of nowhere
It feels good here better than you know
Isn't it only fair that you try and let it go?

Yours was the ring that I started to wear
Yours were the vows that went up in the air
Yours was the choice to stay away from her
Mine was the dream that got lost in the stir

These were the times I would call you my own
These were the times I were waiting at home

I'll tell you something, I've been changing after what you put me through
There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you

[Chorus]

'Cause only a fool would do this again
Only a fool would let you back in
There is no you left to embrace
There is no word would make it feel safe

[Chorus 2]

Let it go
Let it go
I said ""only a fool""
""Only a fool""
",Only a Fool
Marit Larsen,"
You give me this and leave me alone here
Do you presume the battle's won?
I'll keep my head above the water
'til you admit the damage's done

Dry shimmer dazzle afternoon
Your poison passion came too soon
You waste what you think you own
You cry when you're still alone

I will not let you go destroy this
I won't allow a broken promise
You give me this and leave me wondering
Am I supposed to put my faith in

Dry shimmer dazzle afternoon
Your poison passion came too soon
You waste what you think you own
You cry when you're still alone
You cry when you're still alone




",Poison Passion
Marit Larsen,"How hard can it be
To have and to keep
What everyone has
I walk in the streets
The beautiful meet
They're starting to laugh

I know too much
I've seen too much
I crave to much
I'm out of touch

My recent illusion
Blurred out my conclusion
There's no one for me
I can't do it right
I can't sleep at night
He's all that I see

I want to much
I seek too much
I try too much
I'm out of touch
I feel to much
Demand too much
I lose too much
I've lost my touch

I aim high, you aim low
Oh, ain't that just the way it goes
I see sparks, you see none
Had I only quit while it was fun
",Recent Illusion
Marit Larsen,"Dive in with me
I've got dust on my feet
I've got guilt on my hands
I need to get myself a second chance
 
Dive in with me
I got mud to my knees
My partner in crime
Tell me have you got the time
 
I'm coming clean of jealousy and shame
I've come to play the sinking game
I've come to let my armor down
Come to let my armor down
 
We dive into disease we dive deep, deep down in the sea
Hold your breath with me and until I'm ready
We dive into devotion, through all of my emotions
You will not let me go 'til youâ??re finished with me
 
Dive in with me
My eyes are heavy
I can't come at peace
I can't remember what I did
 
I'm coming clean of jealousy and shame
I've come to play the sinking game
I've come to let my armor down
Come to let my armor down

Hold your breath with me and until I'm ready
We dive into devotion, through all of my emotions

Marit Larsen,"Cannot fall, never do regret
Know just what is being said
Know the risk you take
Keep your head above it all
Sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove
Something new, being you, being you

Can't feel, keep from asking why
Be the strongest at goodbyes
Know your place in life
Now expand your wings and fly
It reaches high but not,
Enough you seem to me
So incomplete, swept off your feet

And let me tell you they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground

Cannot know, lose your self-control
Be and angel over all
Know your secret way
Laugh at everything they say
Will you remain the same?
And now you dare not see
What's letting go
Inside of me,is it me?

And they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground

Keep your head above it all, sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove

And they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will haunt your every dream
They will make you come undone at the seams
And they will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground?

Keep your head above it all
Sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove
Something new, being you, being you
",Solid Ground
Marit Larsen,"She looks for all the signs
Checks your shirt when you get home
To make sure
She keeps an eye on your telephone
Instead of asking you she asks everyone you're with
And ends up in dark conclusions you're not alone

She calls you up repeatedly
Knows where you're at all the time

[Chorus]
At night you tell her she's all you long for
But she knows by your face there has got to be more
Her eyes are too narrow, her legs are too long
She knows by this time tomorrow you'll be gone

She used to be ahead
She had thrilling and exciting things to say
She kept you on your toes all the way
But know the tides have turned
You have come too close to knowing her
God forbid you know what she's really like

When she sleeps she keeps her make up on
She prefers to live in a lie

[Chorus]
You'll be gone

Da da da-da da da da
Da da da-da da da da
Na na na-na na na na

[Chorus]
You'll be gone
",This Time Tomorrow
Marit Larsen,"
A dream in a jar
A memory scar
Though trapped in a frame
Not one day the same
I fell and I weep
'til I'm too tired to sleep
And I ask permission to land
To strike up the band

Yet I'll build and I'll sow
I'll watch 'til it grows
And I will take the chance
There'll be no last dance

No when it arrives
The darkest of nights
Let me have my back turned
And not realise

The story's coming to an end
I'll never be just giving in
I'm living by the rolling dice
It's closure but it's in disguise

I try and I try (I will try so hard)
I'll play with the fire (I circle around the fire because)
It goes unexplained (it goes unexplained)
I'm still in the game (I'm still in the game)
I'm scared to the bone (I'm scared to the bone)
I'm sitting at home (I'm sitting at home)
I prepared on the day (will bet on the day)
They're ready for me

No when it arrives
The brightest of lights
Let me have my back turned
And not realise

The story's coming to an end
I'll never be just giving in
I'm living by the rolling dice




",To an End
Marit Larsen,"It's such a funny sensation to be
So happy that you wanna die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised

Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence's more than I can handle
It's come to the point where I wonder if I
Could ever be luckier when

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good
As good as we are
Do you remember?
Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry under the surface?

Lend me your ears, I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real
By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels

Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words
I'm worried she's still on your mind

[Chorus]

Mmm... I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know, but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad

[Chorus]
Under the surface
Under the surface
",Under the Surface
Marit Larsen,"When the leaves fell down you were my lover
Winter taught me you were my friend
When the spring came 'round I'd often wonder
Would the summer bring you back again
But now I know

With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me

I try to find a new direction
You wait on every corner turned
But the minute I ask your attention
You turn on your heels and I get burned
At least I know
At least I know

With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything, getting anything, getting anything from me

Like day and night I know this much is true
(With you it's about the chase)
Still every path it leads me back to you
(With you it's about the chase)
It's like a disease, I don't wanna get well
(It's like a disease)
I know it's not easy, but it's easy to tell
It's easy to tell, it's easy to tell with you

With you it's about
With you it's about
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything, getting anything, getting anything today

With you it's about the chase

Marit Larsen,"I could try it with a walz
I could try rock 'n' roll
I could try it with the blues
If a song would do

I could sing it high or low
When I let you go you know
I thought it was for the best
Now it is so obvious

So here it is, here it goes
I could try rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever-tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you

I could run for miles and miles
I'd take off and I'd start flying
I could cross land and sea
If you'd just believe me
I should not have hurt you so
This old house is not a home
Without you here, there's no use
I've got no time left to lose

So here it is, here it goes
I could try rock 'n' roll

If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you

If a song could get me through
I'd sing my way right back to you
Tell me how, to make it right
Tell me now, I'll start tonight
I know I could make it last

I swear to you that if I knew
What I was getting myself into
I wouldn't answer to my fears
I'd never leave you standing there
Just look at me

If you'd only see me
I would prove my love for you
I could swallow half the moon
Just tell me where, tell me when
I will have you back again

Yeah here it is, here it goes
I could try rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever-tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you

Yeah here it is, here it goes

Marit Larsen,"I got a secret I'm dying to tell you
You're sound asleep, I don't wanna wake you
I'm about to break your heart and you don't know
You don't know

I've got my suitcase it's locked and loaded
And just in case you haven't noticed
I'm about to break your heart or so I hope
So I hope

Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I'll see you no more
I've tried and I, can't cry tonight
I've tried and I, can't cry tonight
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You look sweet like when I first saw you
Heaven knows how I once adored you
I'm about to kiss your mouth one last time

No dream under your eyelashes
Could ever prepare you for this
I'm about to break your heart like you broke mine

Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I'll see you no more
I've tried and I, can't cry tonight
I've tried and I, can't cry tonight
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I'll see you no more
I've tried and I, can't cry tonight

Don't move you stay right where you are

Tucked in your skin, is where you’ll find
That little light, that mends your bones

Maritime,"We touch like human beings the rotten stars are smiling
The ocean floor has open arms for wax wings
Air is the ghost of blood mansions
In the hourglass insideways glances

In the corner of our lives the ivy and the wall
Divides colour is the suffering of light and speed

Se é crime ou pecado
Mas eu sou assim
E fugindo ao fado
Fugia de mim

Cantando dou brado
E nada me dói
Se é pois um pecado
Ter amor ao fado
Que Deus me perdoe

Quanto canto não penso
No que a vida é de má
Nem sequer me pertenço
Nem o mal se me dá

Chego a querer a verdade
E a sonhar, sonho imenso
Que tudo é felicidade
E tristeza não há

Esas pequeñas verdades que guiaron mi camino
Verdades blancas como la mañana
Que abre la ventana de nuestro destino
Como tu mirada cuando tu me miras
Como tu recuerdo cuando ya te has ido

Es verdad que la sombra del aire me quema
Ai, es verdad, que sin ti yo me muero de pena

I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Did you good by the spring

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Somebody please explain to them what it be about
""Take a deep breath relax, don't push it on out.""(x2)
Somebody please explain to them what it be about

They can't sleep yet, too many re-grets
Got em running round in circles for the re-spect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product

So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys

I stay up-set,with all the pup-pets
Submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain

Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down

And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Breathe in, breathe out, somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Somebody fill up my gut before I freak out

Low profile, no more smiles, til all of why'all quit acting so damn wild
Slow down child, you're gonna lose balance, too
Overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?

How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)

Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet

I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?

I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs

I'm out, I want to live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

Mark Adler,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things
In my better days

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall

It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Strings on my fingers and nothin' to fear

Halfway to nowhere and hung out to dry

My view was an eagle's so I flew far and wide
Every new vision the further I'd glide
It's thin in this airway, I start to come down
Halfway to nowhere with my feet on the ground

My words are wise when I disguise them
But deep inside I bleed
I search for perfection everywhere that I roam
My head on the highway and my heart safe at home

All my friends were somewhere else
They never wondered why

A crowded table near me
Was probably feeling tight
So I stayed in the corner
And I think I drank all night

The less that you can see me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me I'll fade away

I was reminiscing with the one that got away
But my heart just dropped
And my mouth just stopped
There was nothing else to say

I could see right through her
As the truth fell from the sky
And the walls around came crashing down
And the future drifted by

The more that you can see me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me I'll fade away

More than one way to skin a dog
You say who's had his day
So take my hand and come
With me and we'll fade away

Headlights in your eyes
In another lonely city
On another sleepless night

The more that you see through me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me, I'll fade away

You know she's gone for good and you miss her
You think she's coming home and you're wasted

And you wake to find
That if you care then you'll be there
You gotta try a little harder
It just takes time

Stopped in town yesterday on my way to Baltimore
To play for the evening, I never thought to call
And I learned today that it'll never be the same
You can't recapture anything that isn't of it's time

But if you care then you'll be there
You gotta try a little harder

Headlines that I've casually read
Nothing good can be spoon fed it's obvious
I'm taking off into thin air, if I never land I don't care
As long as I am happy there, I'm there to stay

And the shadows are growing longer with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are pounding, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

Melodies mysterious, the music is to serious
Chalk it up to experience and wander on
Seasons change but don't inspire the words
That work but aren't for hire
They're hanging off the thinning wire that is my brain

And the shadows are growing longer with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are pounding, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

I feel it till I strike a note
That's sure to set my head afloat
With remedies, anecdotes I'm needing
As I head through space unknown
I'll take my first few steps alone
And hope that I'm not plain out prone and broken

And the shadows are growing stronger with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are beating, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

",Last Light
Mark Bryan,"The winds out on the highway carry other every man's tune
If you're going our way we'll see you there soon
The wings of an angel traded for wheels
Words aren't important if you know how it feels

Soon the sun will be gone, tie another one on
Frustrated and broken but lingering on
Praying this desire will never be gone

The warmth of a stranger can be found in his ear
The worst of your dangers is found in your fear
So drink another, coin a phrase
We'll be home one of these days

And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on

It's a story of patience and faith till the end
No one's gonna break down but we've all got to bend
Like Call and Augustus when the dove is alone
We continue with a passion, destination unknown

So pull up a chair and open your mind
We'll be around for a long long time
And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on

Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on, take it all night
Don't let 'em get the best of you now, don't put up a fight

The groove out on the highway is as long as it seems
From one joint to another as you follow your dreams
Through fables anon without a moral to lend
'Cause you can't have a moral if the story won't end

And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Mark Chapman,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Thought I'd wrapped up the case
I went and promised my heart
But you just laughed in my face

I loved you
I cared

And feel the joy and pain of yesterday

But swore that I'd be back again - Pick up where I left off, oh man
Grown up sexy Texas babies I got back in town tonight
Anticipating much delight
I pulled out my black book and called up my old lovers
I got five newlyweds and two expectant mothers

All my old flames have new names
There's a lot of girls in town
Who tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with one of my old flames

My pretty little black-eyed Susie's now Mrs. Susan Van Der Hoosie

They only bring me down
I dressed my best and headed for
The brightest spot in town
I've watched the rich folks come and go and one thing's very clear
There's just as many lonely people here

I'm just hangin' round a better class of losers
It don't matter if you drink bear or champagne
I've only found a better class of losers
Uptown, downtown, misery's all the same

It's been all downhill for me
Since baby walked away
I'm down here at the bottom
And I guess that's where I'll stay
I'm looking for the answers
But all that I've seen here
Is the same old lonely phony atmosphere

I'm just hangin' round a better class of losers

Mark Chesnutt,"There was rain on the street last night
We stood beneath the front door light
And everything we said we made sure the neighbors heard
You called me this, I called you that
Standing on the welcome mat
Everything we felt it all came down to just one word
But you couldn't say it and I couldn't say it

You know I tried my best to go
I know you cried 'cause I hurt you so
It should have been easy to say that we were through
But to walk away from love was more than we could do
It was almost goodbye
Almost goodbye

Now there was sun through the blinds this morning
When I opened up my eyes
Outside I could hear a mockingbird
And I could feel your heartbeat as you laid there by my side
I thought of how the world could end with just one word
But you didn't say it, and I didn't say it

You know I tried my best to go
I know you cried 'cause I hurt you so
It should have been easy to say that we were through
But to walk away from love was more than we could do
It was almost goodbye
Almost goodbye

Sometimes the most important words are the ones that you leave unspoken
You know I tried my best to go
And I know you cried 'cause I hurt you so
It should have been easy to say that we were through
But to walk away from love that way was more than we could do
It was almost goodbye
Almost goodbye, no, I couldn't say it was

Just split up all the money and pass it all around

But now that that's all settled and it's all said and done
Here's a few things that I'll leave with each and everyone
To the boys I leave the family name, the honesty and pride
To both my precious girls, I leave a million lullabies

Sing them to your children and let them know you care
And take what strength I gave to you and be patient, kind and fair
To all I leave undying love, let no one shed a tear
'Cause I was the luckiest man on earth in the time that I was here

And finally to mother who's love was ever true
The greatest a man can give, I leave my heart to you

Mark Chesnutt,"Well, early this morning it dawned on me
The kind of man she needed me to be
She made a list and laid it there beside me on the bed
Now what I should'a done keep's runnin' through my head

Oh, I should'a done this and I should'a done that
I should'a been there, then she'd a never left
I should'a been hangin' on every word she ever had to say
It's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be the time to change but it's a little too late

Last night I came home at a quarter till three
And to my surprise she wasn't mad at me
I thought she finally realized not to worry I'd be home
Then I realized this mornin' she was gone

Oh, I should'a done this and I should'a done that
I should'a been there, then she'd a never left
I should'a been hangin' on every word she ever had to say
But it's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be the time to change but it's a little too late

But it's a little too late, she's a little too gone
She's a little too right, I'm a little too wrong
Now would be the time to change but it's a little too late
Right now would be the time to change but it's a little too late",It's a Little Too Late
Mark Chesnutt,"Storm clouds risin', flash of lightning
Rattles that ole porch swing
Window open, curtains dancing
Just you and me
As the thunder rolls on we'll just hold on
'Neath the light of this candle flame
Oh this is perfect, what a night
Let it rain

Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside, just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain

Old man weather had it together
When he planned this night
From out of the blue he set the mood
And turned out the lights
And just when we thought the storm was over
Here it comes again
So lay back down in these arms
Let it rain

Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside, just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
",Let It Rain
Mark Chesnutt,"City sun goes down at night
Makin' way for neon lights
Country boy is looking at the moon
City girl is dressed just right
She may stay out late tonight
Country boy just plowed today 'til noon

[Chorus:]
From Birmingham to Ohio
How they met nobody knows
Every now and then they get together
She used to want to climb the walls
She'd never really been loved at all
Not until ol' country came to town

He's the first one too the room
Ice and drinks will be up soon
Everything is perfect when she walks in
They kiss and hold each other tight
They know what's in store tonight
Thery're not someplace they have never been

Mark Chesnutt,"I used to come in here maybe once or twice a year
But only when I had a good excuse
I'd have one or two, then be on my way
But that's way before she told me we were through

Now any ole reason will do, any ole thing that I can use
The days, the nights, the clouds, the rain, the moon
I don't have to think about the love I live without
Or the heart she left that never will be used
Really, any ole reason will do

At first I told myself she'd never cross my mind
Unless I was to meet her eye to eye
And only when I felt alone would I turn her memory on
Well I guess that means I told myself a lie

Now any ole reason will do, any ole thing that I can use

Mark Chesnutt,"You've been gone almost a month
Girl I nearly died
For twenty seven days and nights
Sat right here and cried
If it wasn't for your memory
I'd been here all alone
Goodbye heartache, darlin' welcome home

Treat me any way you want to
Even cuss and swear
Call me anything you need to
I promise I won't care
Just let it all out, your right I was wrong
Goodbye heartache, darlin' welcome home

There's really just no good excuse
For the things I said
The way that I stood up to you
I must have lost my head
And I'm not ashamed to say
Thank God those days are gone

Lord how long has it been
We got some catchin' up to do
Good to see you my old friend

Hello honky tonk long time no see
Never knew that old jukebox could ever sound so sweet
How I missed your neon lights they sure are a welcome sight
Goodbye lonely nights - hello honky tonk

I'm glad nobody's patched that hole
where my head went through the wall
'Cause I just may head that way again
Before we reach last call 
Don't guess I was cut out for 
That old domestic life 
When she told me to hit the door 
I hit yours tonight

I've been down, I've been down
The love you said I'd find to take your place
Never came around, never came around
But one of these days I'll stand on my own
And I'll turn this bleeding heart into stone

Gonna reach way down inside
And find a brand new will to live
Got plans to forget about
The way you made me feel
Gonna walk outside one night
And turn your memory loose
And when I do, I might even quit loving you
And when I do, I might even quit loving you

There was a time I thought I knew for certain
You'd come home, you'd come home
But judging from the nights I've spent without you
I was wrong, I was wrong
The time has finally come to face the truth
There's only one thing left I can do

Gonna reach way down inside
And find a brand new will to live
Got plans to forget about
The way you made me feel

And turn your memory loose
And when I do, I might even quit loving you

Mark Chesnutt,"You can tell everyone love is over and done
You can pack all your things and go
You can lie to yourself and say there's nothing else
But there's something I think you should know

(And) It's never really over even though you say we're through 
You may be over me but can't you see 
It's not over if I'm not over you

There's not much I can do if it's over for you
I'll just wish you the best when you leave
But you've played such a part in my life and in my heart
You'll always be a part of me

(And) It's never really over even though you say we're through 
You may be over me but can't you see

",It's Not Over
Mark Chesnutt,"I can't recall how many times she said she'd never leave
Or the times she swore the only one for her was me
But the angel I was counting on has all but disappeared
And the only trace of her that's left I find each night in there

'Cause she's just numbers on the jukebox that I lean on 
There's a little bit of her in every hurtin' song
I used to hate the thought of her 'til her memory I forget
Cause she's just numbers on the jukebox

B-11 takes me back to the first dance we shared
And A-14 reveals the truth she never cared
One by one they're telling all the stories of my past 
And why the love I thought could never die lies here behind this glass

'Cause she's just numbers on the jukebox that I lean on 
There's a little bit of her in every hurtin' song
I used to hate the thought of her 'til her memory I forget
Cause she's just numbers on the jukebox",Numbers on the Jukebox
Mark Chesnutt,"Last night I came home again
Three sheets to the wind
And broke the promise I swore I'd never break
And it came as no surprise
To see the hurt in her eyes
Or the bible on the table where she prayed
This time I thought for sure she was good as gone
But she just wiped the tears away and put some coffee on

I don't know why she even hangs around
After all the hell I've put her through
And the times I've let her down
She has more faith in me than anyone has ever found
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers

She says, ? Boy, I still love you ?
Oh she's stronger than the ninety proof
I sent coursing through my veins
She says, ?Don't give up the fight
Before long you'll get it right ?
I pray to God someday I feel the same
Sunday morning beside her in the pew
Through blood shot eyes I try to see her point of view

I don't know why she even hangs around
After all the hell I've put her through
And the times I've let her down
She has more faith in me than anyone has ever found
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers
",Thank God for Believers
Mark Chesnutt,"Last night I dreamed I went to sleep for good
And in the crowd that gathered ?round, there you stood
When it finally came your turn to say goodbye
Right then and there, I watched you break down and cry

And that's when I knew I was dreamin'
The vision was too good to be true
It'd take much more than just me dying
For me to ever see that side of you

At first I thought you were an angel
Waiting there to carry me away
Then the pain left my heart when I felt your touch
And in your arms I found everlasting love

And that's when I knew I was dreamin'
The vision was too good to be true
It'd take much more than just me dying
For me to ever see that side of you
",That Side of You
Mark Chesnutt,"The day you left I thought I knew for certain
There's no way in this world I'd wind up hurtin'
I thought getting over you was gonna be a breeze
So it all came as quite a shock when it turned out to be

Useless as these empty arms
Useless as this broken heart
Useless as these nights I spend alone
I could lie and try to say
I quit loving you in just one day
But the truth is it's useless

Not long ago I met this little red head
And she seemed to hang on every word that I said
I thought going out with her would get you off my mind
So I spent half my paycheck in one evening just to find

Useless as these empty arms
Useless as this broken heart
Useless as these nights I spend alone
I could lie and try to say
I quit loving you in just one day
But the truth is it's useless",Useless
Mark Chesnutt,"Once in a lifetime, love comes along
And I know it's you that I'm waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hanging on, through times like this

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too

Mark Chesnutt,"I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you
And I don't want to miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't want to miss a thing

And I'm wondering what your dreaming
Wondering if it's me your seeing
And then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together

Just like this
I just want to hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment

I could hardly wait to hold my baby again
A man will never see a more beautiful sight
Than home sweet mobil home in his truck headlights
But except for a cedar deck and cinder blocks
All I saw was a vacant lot

So I'm drivin' around, all over town
Wonderin' where she hauled it away
Yeah she's on a roll, which way do I go
I've been through every single trailer park and KOA
She's been mad before, but never this sore
You can surely bet from now on
I won't wander from from her lovin' arms
If I ever find my way back home

Guess my homeless situation is partly my fault
For another thousand dollars down I could have bought
That house in the country that she loved so much
With all that brick and wood there ain't no way it would budge
It's easy now to figure out where I went wrong
But a little harder finding love that's gone

So many nights I could only dream ya
But now you're here my Angelina

I watch the moonlight softly brush your hair
Are you a vision; are you really there
But then you touch me and the fantasy is so real

Oh Angelina, I loved ya long before I'd ever seen ya
So many nights I could only dream ya
But now you're here my Angelina

Oh Angelina, each day there's somethin'' 
new I love about you
And I wonder how I ever lived without you
Oh how I need you, my Angelina",Angelina
Mark Chesnutt,"I tossed and turned and tried counting sheep
When will I ever learn how I'll ever sleep
Till you're by my side it's just a waste of time
Ain't no use tryin' to get you off my mind

[Chorus]
So I guess I'll be confessin' my love, confessin' my love
There ain't gonna be no restin' at all 'cause I want you too much
I might get all embarrassed and a little tongue-tied
""Cause I ain't had no lessons in expressin' it right
Yes I guess I'll be confessin' my love to you tonight

Toughest thing to do is up and speak my mind
I've been wanting you for too long a time
I just can't take this anymore
'Bout to hear some knockin' on your front door

Mark Chesnutt,"There's a photo in my baby book
Of the first step that I ever took
I ended up on my butt with a puzzled look

Ever since I've been kinda confused
When life tripped me up I was easily bruised
But time has a way of healin' wounds

Now I'm a guy who does what he feels
But I never seem to spot that banana peel
With eyes shut tight and nerves of steel
Takin' the plunge baby head over heels

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Coming down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you

Who can say what may lie in store
Smooth sailin' on a sea of love or
Runnin' aground on a rocky shore

Now that I've found you I'm not lettin' go
'Cause I've been searchin' high and love
Only one thing that I know
The higher you take me the deeper I go

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Coming down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you

Mark Chesnutt,"I was hoping you'd be gone
Tonight when I got home
What are you still waiting for
You're probably thinking that
She won't like it where's she's at
And she'll come knocking on my door
I used to believe that too
But I don't anymore

[Chorus]
So go away, blues don't hang around
She's gone, let me love again somehow
I've tried, but I could not make her stay
So be like her and go away

Well, here we are again
My old foul-weather friend
Not much left to talk about
We've cried and shared some laughs
Reminiscing this and that
But it all seems so tiresome now 
You've been good company
But you wore your welcome thin

Mark Chesnutt,"Summer after graduation
Two kids stuck in Alabama
We'd be lovers any way we could
A ten buck wedding ceremony
A guy outside the courthouse told me
The weather down in South Beach sure was good
So we hit the road like any dreamers would

She was mine for a time in Miami
Thought I had her in the palm of my hand
Like the sunrise the truth finally hit me
That her heart was halfway back to Birmingham

This ain't what she really wanted
So baby we went on back to Mama
Found a note when I got home last night 
Left a fifty for the landlord
Nothin' here to stay around for
Ain't but one way left to make it right
So I'm headed for that Alabama line

She was mine for a time in Miami
But things don't always work out like you plan
Now I'm nearly out of gas and it's raining
But I'm almost halfway back to Birmingham

That her heart was halfway back to Birmingham",Halfway Back to Birmingham
Mark Chesnutt,"My oldest brother Tommy was a lineman rest his soul
His job was hanging hot wires on them power company poles
I said with all of that high voltage don't it scare you half to death?
He said it makes me kinda nervous but I just can't help myself 'cause

[Chorus]
It pays big money and boy I'm into that
It pays big money if you're willin' to take a chance
I'll tell you sonny you ought to see my bank account
It paid big money but he sure can't spend it now

My dear departed cousin used to put in forty hours
Changing all them light bulbs on them television towers
Every morning bright and early he'd climb up in the sky
And I didn't understand it so one day I asked him why, he said

[Chorus]

My late Uncle Charlie was demolition man
And he traveled all over the country blasting holes in this great land
And he carried a case of dynamite everywhere he went
And he'd smoke them big long cigar's 'til it got the best of him, but

[Chorus]

Now the moral of this story
Is don't go getting yourself killed
And be kind to your rich relatives
And they might just leave you in their will
And that pays big money having foolish kin
It pays big money, I guess I owe it all to them
I'll tell you sonny you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money think I'll go spend some of it now",It Pays Big Money
Mark Chesnutt,"We step out on the dance floor the band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

Time's standing still as I Whirl you around
We're dancing without even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

No words are spoken
None need to be said

Through my window I see him going down the street and he don't know

After love in the hot afternoon

Now the bourbon street lady sleeps like a baby in the shadows
She was new to me and fully of mystery but now I know
That she's just a girl and I'm just a guy in the room
For love in the hot afternoon

We got high in the park this morning and we sat without talking
Then we came back here in the heat of the day tired of walking
Where under her breathe she hummed to herself a tune
Of love in the hot afternoon

And discovered that you got no reason staying up
Right at the moment when
The caffine is kickin' in

So you break down and give an old girlfriend a call
Then after two hours of hearing her mindless talk
You remember what you dumped her for
And you wish you hadn't opened that door

Hate to admit it but I think that I
Got something rollin' round loose inside

To line your pockets with dough

Knowing that she'll break your heart
And max out your credit cards

Somebody's looking out for me
Oh what an opportunity
Right out of the blue
Is it luck or a twist of fate
Doesn't really matter either way
It's a good night, a good night to be lonely

Dollars worth of quarters
Played some songs and ordered
One for me and one for her as I tipped my hat
Said that she felt restless
Just moved here from Texas
That's when I suggested
Maybe she could dance with me
She said thought you'd never ask

And the curtain's torn in two, from me lookin' out for you
Once we held it all together, but I can't do it on my own

In our bedroom where you used to love on me

That don't look too flower like

In the door jam, left me and the stems outside

She'd smile when I told her
There was one for each day that I'd been gone

I tried to think like a woman
Find out where that pretty head was at
I tried to think like a woman
But I don't guess a woman thinks like that

I'm underneath the window
With my guitar in the back yard, soakin' wet
She poured what I'm afraid
Might've been toilet water on my head

And I thought when she heard this song
I wrote her on my way back into town
It would cool her off but it appears
It worked the other way around

And I see her peakin' out
Well, I lay here lookin' sad a while

It's all slowly dawnin' on me now
I tried to think like a woman

Mark Collie,"Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said two hundred agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

'Son', his daddy told him, 'Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with a hundred proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew?

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first",Ballad of Thunder Road
Mark Collie,"The wind blows hard across the Texas planes

While others quietly pray for rain

One with books, one with guns

Johnny was a rebel alright he knew where to stand and where to fight

Blow through town standing on one wheel
Long hair flyin' like a sheet in the wind I knew he never would fit in
In the old hometown again


Yeah Johnny was a rebel alright...

I saw an angry mob get out of hand I saw Johnny take a bullet for another man

My baby did but now she don't
And if I don't say I do it's a safe bet that she won't
Love me like she used to
When our love began
Why the only way to change her tune
Is with a wedding band?

She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take

She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
I'll have to put a ring on her finger
If I want to be her man

She wants something with a ring to it

Never knowing why they're here
They never find someone like you
The moment I touched your hand
And looked into your eyes
I knew what I was meant to do

And fear cuts through me

What would I do
If you weren't laying by my side

Mark Collie,"Everybody said Bobby was a little hard-headed.
If there ever was a book on love, Bobby never read it.
Suzy was a poor boy's dream in a high school sweater.
She was ready to run but her Daddy wouldn't let her.
She told her Momma how she loved her man,
She said: ""Daddy don't understand.""
While she was cryin', Momma shook her head.
She took her by the hand and said:

""It takes a hard lovin' woman;
""Takes a hard lovin' woman;
""Takes a hard lovin' woman,
""To love a hard-headed man.""

Bobby got a job at the west end fillin' station.
He was savin' for a diamond ring after graduation.
Suzy's old man came by for some gas and water.
He said: ""Boy, stay away from my daughter.""

Bobby climbed up to Suzy's room.

She cried the day she called to say she was having his child

But you live with decisions that you make in your life
And what steers your direction is hard to understand

It ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago
But tonight at a truck stop, while drinking a cup

Mark Collie,"I woke up in a hotel, didn't know what to do
I turned the TV on, wrote a letter to you
The news was talkin' 'bout a dead man upon the interstate
Seems they were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Well, since I left California, baby, things have gotten worse
Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse
Tell that judge in Bakersfield my trial'll have to wait
Down here they're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

It was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside
She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride
Three bank jobs later, four cars hot wired
We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire

Now if they'd known what we was up to they wouldn't let us in
And now we landed in Memphis like original sin
Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates
See we were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Well, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage
There wasn't one Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge
There wasn't one Japanese model or make
Just pretty, pretty Cadillacs with Tennessee plates

And ever since that day she's been living in between

Tuesday looked like rain
A bad altitude
And I knew I needed a change

Head out on the highway
Cruising way down south
I knew a little place
Where I might could work it all out

I'm so tired of fighting with myself
Gonna spend a little time at the Tunica Motel

Just outside of Memphis, Highway 61
Sleepy little town down by the Mississippi river
I'm gonna layout on a houseboat
Until my hide turn brown
Ain't gonna move 'till the evening sun goes down

Fried chicken to go
And they got live bait for sale
Anything you need at the Tunica motel

I find myself at midnight
Moving to the back porch blues
The guitar cries, telling me about the hard times

Something moves in the shadows
Giving me a little chill
I thought I saw Robert Johnson
Walking out across the field

There ain't hardly nobody
Left who even knows the tale
Gimme the blues at the Tunica motel.

Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be

If there's anything at all
If there's anything at all
I'm sure of here and now and us together

All I'll ever be I'll owe you
If there's anything to be

Makes me sure enough of me

Thanks for everything we did
Everything that's past, every thing's that's over too fast
None of it was wasted, all of it will last
Everything that's here and now and us together

It was marvelous to know you and it's really through

Can't complain about the time we're given
With so little to be sure of in this world

Mark DeVille Jobson,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again

Will you find me?

Each halloween your faces get more frightening
The closer i look the more i can see
Your limits begin to show
The astronaut won first prize,
It was was a ton of moon dust
All i see in his eyes are years of hate and mistrust

Will you find me?

""come out come out wherever you are,""
Said the fisherman to the sea
""oh i miss you, i miss you love. where can you be?
If i have to wait anymore then i won't believe
In the love that i've known
Or in the life that i have known.""

Mark Eitzel,"The truth that lived in her green eyes would never let her be
It itched and burned and tripped her up would never make her free
Sometimes hunger is a law that cancels every other law
Her eyes were green much greener than the ocean's long drum roll
Her frightened eyes could always see the coward in your soul

Her eyes were green much greener than all the cash she stole
But you threw here out because compared to hers your life was a minor role

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

No tears, no fuss,

I'm not the kind to believe in superstition
Lately the truth I have seen is stranger than non-fiction
You race through my blood, some kind of sweet addiction
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I sleepwalk the streets of this town looking for your face
Ain't got nothing to show right now, but I can't give up the chase
Won't you give me a sign, some kind of saving grace
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Can't get you off my mind

I must be going insane
All these streets look the same
Nobody answers when I call out your name

CHORUS
I need you the most
When you're not around
I'm in love with your ghost
You're invisible now
I know that it's wrong
To keep holding on to something you can't even see

Guess you can already see that my heart is haunted
You are all that I need, everything I've ever wanted
Lost myself somewhere in between, can't you hear me calling
Wish I may, wish I might
First star I chance to see tonight

Wish I could disappear right now
Fade into this faceless crowd
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of missing you out loud

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds

Pastures of plenty for the tired and poor
Still too many hands empty behind the golden door

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds
Why not here? Why not now?

Someday we all will live the dream
There'll be no cracks to fall between
Somewhere where everyone will have enough
But here and now, it's up to us

Someday we all will be at peace
And all of our suffering will cease

We are passing this world on to our kids
From the moment that they climb out of their cribs
We try to teach them well
And show them they are loved
But in the end all we can do
Is hope our best is good enough
For they'll witness how this life
Can be so beautiful and cruel
We can't shelter them forever
But if we show them all the tools
They might leave this place in
A little better shape than me and you
We are only passing through

We've been watching this world from our living rooms
It's been near 40 years since we walked on the moon
And this big blue ball keeps shrinking
And I don't know if that's good
But for better or for worse now
This whole world's our neighborhood
There's no place left to run to
Where you can stay above the fray
We all learn to need to get along
And not just get our way
Not only for each other but
For our children's children too
We are only passing through

CHORUS

I wonder sometimes what I will pass on
And how much can one voice do with just a song
Sometimes injustice and indifference
Are the only things I see
But I refuse to let my hope
Become the latest casualty
So I'll sing of love and truth
And try to practice all I preach
And if I can't change the world
I'll change the world within my reach
And what better place to start
Than here and now with me and you
We are only passing through

There's some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful

Some kind of sweet lips
Some kind of warm eyes
Some kind of soft sigh
There's only some kind of wonderful

Oh yeah wonderful",Some Kind of Wonderful
Mark Farner,"When a man loves a woman,
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else,
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found.
If she is bad, he can't see it,
She can do no wrong,
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down.
When a man loves a woman,
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs.
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain,
If she said that's the way
It ought to be.
Well, this man loves you, woman.
I gave you everything I have,
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love.
Baby, please don't treat me bad.
When a man loves a woman,
Down deep in his soul,
She can bring him such misery.
If she is playin' him for a fool,
He's the last one to know.
Lovin' eyes can never see.
When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong,
He can never want
Some other girl.
Yes,When a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels,
'Cause baby, baby, you're my world

Mark Flugge,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all

You took my love and now you're gone

I guess I'll never be the same

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Nur wenn ich betrunken bin

Packst mich nicht aus, sondern lässt mich im Karton,
Du lässt die Luft raus, wie bei 'nem Luftballon. 
Du wirfst mich raus, aus der Bahn, in der es so gut lief,
Du weckst mich auf, aus dem Traum,
In dem ich grad schlief.
Du packst einen Stein auf den verschlossenen Karton,

Das Denken an Dich schlägt mir langsam auf den Magen,

Soll er schwimmen, soll er treiben,

Yeah

Wir sind schon ein, zwei Jahre zusammen
Und haben schon drei, vier Sachen erlebt
Doch bist du nur fünf Minuten mal weg
Ist das wie zehn Jahre Knast für mich
Ey du wickelst mich zu leicht um deinen Finger
Wenn du durch deine blauen Augen guckst wie immer
Ich bin hypnotisiert, wenn du vorbei spazierst
Es wird jeden Tag ein kleines bisschen schlimmer

Flash mich nochmal, als wär's das erste mal
Baby, Baby crash mich so oft du willst
Ja bis ich nicht mehr kann
Und seit du da bist sind alle Lichter an
Du machst das ich nicht mehr schlafen kann
Ich sehe uns zwei in alt und grau
Mit weißen Harren und dicken Bauch
Flash mich nochmal, als wer's das erste mal, yeah

Wir haben schon eins zwei Kriege geführt
Und haben schon drei, vier Zimmer demoliert
Aber weil fünf Minuten ohne dich zu viel sind
Bin ich auch mit neunzig immer noch bei dir
Ey du wickelst mich zu leicht um deinen Finger
Wenn du durch deine langen Haare fährst wie immer
Ich werde kontrolliert, wenn du vorbei spazierst
Und es wird jeden Tag ein kleines bisschen schlimmer

Flash mich nochmal, als wär's das erste mal

Ja bis ich nicht mehr kann

Durchzupf’ mein Kissen, weil’s nicht richtig sitzt.
Ich wälz’ mich in jede Ecke, 
Such’ `nen Platz wo endlich Ruhe ist.
Zwischen meinen Augenlidern sitzen Federn.
Ich kneif’ sie zu, sie springen auf.
Mein Kopf denkt, er ist Geisterjäger,
Hält den Geigerzähler auf mich drauf.

Es wird eins, dann ist’s vier, dann sieben.
Das Helle hat das Schwarz vertrieben.
Ich folg’ dem kleinen Zeiger vom Tick zum Tack.

Gedanken stapeln sich wie Tetris,
Ich krieg’ sie nicht mehr einsortiert.
Meinen Sorgen ist egal, wie spät's ist.
Die Bengel pöbeln rum in mir.
Ich weiß schon, alles wird sich richten.
Das Leben ist ´ne Kegelbahn.
Ich kann nicht aufhören mit dem Augenwischen.
Ich hör’ die Wecker klingeln nebenan.

Krass was mit der Zeit passiert
Wie schnell man den Kontakt verliert
Hab grad gemerkt, dass ich deine neue Nummer nicht hab
Wollt nur mal hören wie's dir geht

Und ich frag mich was du machst

Ich trink auf dich mein Freund
Auf jeden Tag aus unserer Zeit
Auf das was geht und das was bleibt

Ich trink auf dich mein Freund
Ich heb auf dich mein Glas
Auf das was kommt und das was war

Ich schenk mir nochmal nach
Werd langsam sentimental
Es passte nichts zwischen uns beide
Heut hab ich Schiss dir kurz zu schreiben
Sind wir Freunde die sich selten sehen
Oder sind wir keine Freunde mehr
Ey wichtig ist es nicht
Was wir hatten steht für sich

Ich trink auf dich mein Freund

Auf das was geht und das was bleibt

Auch wenn man Zeit nicht konserviert
Und man sich irgendwann verliert
Ist es schon gut so wie es ist

Mark Forster,"Ich weiß, ich bin nicht von der besten Art
Ich meld' mich viel zu selten und das stresst dich ab
Hast ja meistens Recht, wenn du mal sauer bist
Doch ich bin immer sicher, lange dauert's nicht
Ach, komm, jetzt zieh nicht so 'ne Fick-dich-Fresse
Ich versprech's dir heilig, dass ich mich besser'
Und glaubst du nicht, wirst schon sehen
Und klappt's dann nicht, kein Problem

Man kann die Straße nicht mehr sehen
Und wir beide wissen bald
Ist Zeit, mal Heim zu gehen

Was ist bloß passiert
Alle so erwachsen um uns rum
Alle, außer wir
Komm, lass 'n Film reinziehen
Mal wieder Siedler spielen

Ich hab die Übersicht verloren
Alles viel zu groß
Wir haben heut' nichts zu tun
Komm, lass mal Pizza holen

Und wieder lachst du über meine grauen Haare
Bin froh, dass ich die überhaupt noch habe
Hast dich selber wirklich kaum verändert
Seitdem du sprechen kannst, gehst du mir auf'n Sender
Würd' ich dich treffen heute ganz auf's Neue
So wie du bist, ich glaub, ich würd' dich feiern
Ey, meine engste Sippe, das bist du

Doch waren uns immer, wie wir sind, genug
Wo ich auch bin, ich hoff', es geht dir gut

Wir sind bestimmt nicht aus'm Kitsch-Roman, doch
Wenn ich dich seh', dann nehm' ich dich in' Arm
Wenn's draußen schneit, dann lass nach Hause fahr'n

Und alles spricht dagegen
Kilometerweit, kein Weg zurück
Von roten Ampeln umgeben
Alle Warnsirenen klingen wie Musik

Nur du und ich und tausend Neins
Die wieder langsam verschwinden

Von Maverick auf Autopilot

Und hab’ vergessen, wer ich sein wollte

Wie ich bin und wie du mich siehst
Dazwischen gibt’s ein Unterschied
Ich nehm’ die Kamera und halt’ sie still
Komm, ich schieß’ für dich ’n klares Bild

Und aus „nix zu tun“ wurd’ „keine Zeit mehr“

Blinder Tunnelblick das seh’ ich jetzt
Fremdes Spiegelbild im Badezimmer

Mein wahres Ich ich will’s dir zeigen

Die neuen Träume und die alten auch
All die Narben und die paar Trophäen
Ich wünschte, man könnt’ alles sehen
Auch das letzte Pixel will ich zeigen
Die guten und die schlimmsten Seiten

Mark Forster,"Ey stranges, kleines Leben
Verläuft auf Seitenwegen
Ich such' die Mitte, doch mein Glück liegt meist daneben
So selten Flugrakete, bin mehr so Zugverspätung
Doch die Ernte kommt immer man, es ist gut gesät und
Ich hab kein Stress mit warten
Geh' auch durch schlechte Phasen
Ich bin geduldig und nehme zum Schluss die besten Karten
Und fällt der Jenga Turm, egal gib' mir Verlängerung
Halt neuer Plan dann, denn Leben ist Veränderung

Egal was kommt, es wird gut, sowieso
Immer geht 'ne neue Tür auf, irgendwo
Auch wenn's grad nicht so läuft, wie gewohnt
Egal, es wird gut, sowieso

Verrückte, bunte Reise
Mal Tinnitus und mal leise
Der Beat selbst wächst, vom Steuerrad-Rumgereiße
So selten fitte Planung, bin mehr so dritte Mahnung
Doch immer sicher im Gemetzel, dank der schicken Tarnung
Ich schätze Wegbegleiter, auch wenn alles seine Zeit hat
Mal elf Freunde, dann doch One-on-One Karatefighter
Und steigt der Sendeturm bleibt immer die Erinnerung
Halt neuer Plan, dann den Blick nach vorn, Stück Linderung

Egal was kommt, es wird gut, sowieso
Immer geht 'ne neue Tür auf, irgendwo
Auch wenn's grad nicht so läuft, wie gewohnt

Mal klingt's nach Feiern
Und mal dunkel und trist
Hab alten Müll da drauf, doch auch die Superhits
Und ich spul' zurück
Bis an die Stelle, wo du dann bist

Ich weiß noch, damals im Städtchen
Zu viel Zeit, zu viel Platz, keine Action
Bis in die letzte Ecke alles so vertraut, wie das eigene Treppenhaus
Dann der Tag, los, raus aus dem Kinderzimmer
Auf einmal alle weg, nichts so wie immer
Kurz geguckt, was am weitesten weg ist
Dann alle Koffer rein in den Kombi von Daddy
Erste Nacht, Matratze auf Parkett
Erst so fremd, dann ging ich nicht mehr weg
Auf Safari, durch U-Bahn und Kneipen
Hebt die Gläser auf gute Zeiten

Und immer rollt die Kassette mit
Und all die Songs, ich nehm' sie mit
Ich trag' sie bei mir
Meine Meilensteine

Kopf voll, wir sehen doch keiner wartet
Dann die Komplizen von irgendwo angespült
Alles möglich und wir so mittendrin
Und dann die Party bei Bekannten
Wollt' grad gehen, weil ich kaum jemand kannte
Dann dieses Mädchen mit dem Tier auf'm Shirt
Mein Herz sagt tschüss, weil's jetzt ihr gehört
Und plötzlich Schluss mit Spielchen
Next Level jetzt, aus mir wird vier und
Ich mach' die Flasche auf, auf dem Balkon
Und heb' mein Glas auf das was kommt

Als käm' jetzt gleich die Dramahook, wie bei Coldplay
In meinem Kopf spielt ein Quartett
So schrecklich rhythmisch
Als wär' die Stadt evakuiert, weil's kein Zurück gibt
Als bliebe Kevin ganz allein, weil er nichts mitkriegt
Als könnt' man alles dazu fühlen, doch nie sich glücklich

Vielleicht lief es zu perfekt, und jetzt kommt's wie's kommen musste
Ich hol' sie nach Haus', meine abgefuckten Muster
Mein easy Weg aus Holz, der verlockend glänzt wie Gold
Und mich immer wieder kreutzt, Willkommen zurück!

Meine bösen Geister, meine treusten Begleiter
Ich hab die ganze Zeit geahnt, dass ihr mit dabei wart
Und alles, was mich vor euch schütze, ist auf einmal weg
Zerquetscht, zerdrückt, Willkommen zurück!

Klick-Klick-Klack
Als wär's ein Morsealphabet
Ist nichts hartes, wär' in meinem Kopf ne' 8O8
Von Rick Ross
Als wär' die Zeitbombe soweit, dass sie jetzt platzt
Ich fühl' den Beat bis in den Bauch
Er tritt und boxt mich
Als wär's sein allergrößter Kampf, wie bei Rocky

Hold tight, to me,

Mark Geary,"Don't fall in love if you are far away
Don't fall in love if they are too close
Don't fall in love if you hold onto your things

And in the hallway I kissed you twice
Know you need counselling, some sound advice",A Prayer for St. Rita
Mark Germino,"There's a disc jockey in Hartlanberg 
Who works at W.A.N.T. 
He puts two or three eggs in him 
And he's in your car by 6.00 am 

He lives for his job and he accepts his pay 
You can call and request ‘Lay Lady Lay' 
He'll play Stanley Jordan, The ‘Dead and Little Feat 
And he'll even play the band from the college down the street 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open, but he'll tell you where to go 
If you're dumb enough to ask him why he plays Hank Snow 

Well, he tries to keep his talkin' to a minimum 
He's a Democrat, he's a Republican 
He's an ad man with a great voice, say some 
But when he spins those records he's neither one 

He'll talk to the truckers on the interstate strip 
The housewife and the car dealership 
And when his second wife left him for a paper millionaire 
He cried unashamedly right on the air 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open but he makes no bones 
About why he plays Madonna after George Jones 

Now, one day a man in a pinstriped suit 
Took the owner of the station to a restaurant booth 
His pitch was simple, “you'll increase your sales 
“If you only play the song list we send in the mail.” 

He guaranteed a larger audience 
Less confusion and higher points 
“But your drive-time jock won't get to do his thing. 
“Hey he's not half bad, tell me, what's his name?” 

Well his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's frequently heard, but he's seldom seen 
His formula's simple and his format's big 
“I just play anything, you call and tell me what you dig.” 

Now Rex Bob David Saul Lowenstein 
Quit his job a week later, but before he'd leave 
He locked and bolted the control room door 
And played smash or trash till they cuffed him on the floor 

Well they drug him into court and the judge said, “Rex 
“I've got to lock you up, for what I'm not sure yet. 
“But your boss here says he thinks you're wrapped too tight. 
“But, by the way thanks for playing ‘Moon River' last night” 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's a flaming bell inside a tambourine 
He could play it all if he was just set free 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT ",Rex Bob Lowenstein

Guide you on your way

And she was waiting at the door
Had that bad day look in her eyes

And I heard the sound of her little feet
Across the hardwood floor
And I knelt down with my arms open wide

When I asked her what had happened
She pointed to our son and said
""Why don't you show your daddy what you've done""

And I could see the writing on the wall
Evidence of little hands
Picasso with a purple crayon
And I tried to act upset
But I was smiling through it all
'Cause I could see the writing on the wall, yeah

It was the first day of school
Standing by the laundry door
Wondering how third grade came so fast

I took a ruler and a sharpie pen
And I drew the line once more
So amazed at how the time had passed

With a backpack full of promise
And wonder in her eyes
I turned my head just so she wouldn't see me cry

'Cause I could see the writing on the wall
It seems no matter how I tried
The pages of this life keep turning
It's a roller coaster ride
And even though I knew we had it all
I could see the writing on the wall

I got a cinematic memory
Playing pictures of the past
Adding to the story as we go

'Cause every day I'm learning
That tomorrow comes too fast
So, I'm holding on to the only way I know
Yeah, yeah, whoa

Mark Howard,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

All my life I've waited
And I've been afraid and
I wondered If I'd find
Someone to share my life

Every day I prayed and
Every night I searched in
Every stranger's eyes
For some kind of sign

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you 
A million empty days, too much time and space
Every tear I cried, every lonely night

Now here you are
And my world is, my world is so beautiful
Now here you are
And my life is, and my life is so wonderful

Mark Isham,"Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered, ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
Kinda cute, you want to take a bath?
(do you want to, do you want to, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""

The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner

Where the ground is like a wheel beneath your feet? 
And no matter how you tried you just weren't moving 
In whatever race you're running you'd be beat? 
In whatever race you're running you'd be beat?

I'm a hopeless freak

I'm taking the inside rail

Last night I had a different dream 
I chased the moon's reflection in a running stream 
While all the stars in heaven 
Were standing there so still 
I just keep on running and I'm half way up the hill 

I see the crowd and the finish line 
I see the day when the prize is mine 
It maybe crazy the dream that I swear 
The clouds are all behind me 
The wind's in my hair

Pay no attention to the odds I face

From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try

My fault, I fear.

And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Being with you get's me that way

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

And suddenly I'm melting into you

Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine

There shall I visit the place of my birth
And they'll give me a welcome the warmest on earth
All so loving and kind full of music and mirth,
In the sweet sounding language of home.

Oh ro soon shall I see them;
Oh he ro see them oh see them.
Oh ro soon shall I see them the

There shall I gaze on the mountains again,
On the fields and the woods and the burns and the glens,
Away 'mong the corries beyond human ken
In the haunts of the deer I will roam

To the glens with their meadows of sunshine and dew.
To the women and men ever constant and true,
Ever ready to welcome one home.

And how he loved her oh, so much, and all the charms she did possess.

But it's as real as the feelings I feel.
My love is like a storybook story.
But it's as real as the feelings I feel;
it's as real as the feelings I feel.

Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex.
And how he worshiped the ground she walked on.
When he looked in her eyes, he became obsessed.

This love was stronger than the powers so dark,
A prince could have within his keeping;
His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast, but only sleeping.

He said,
""Don't you know I love you oh, so much, and lay my heart at the foot of your dress."" 
And she said: ""Don't you know that storybook loves,

And on his stallion the rode away.",Once Upon a Time...Storybook Love [From The Princess Bride]

As Cossacks tear us piece by piece
Our dead are strewn a hundred leagues
Though death would be a sweet release
And our grande armÂ¨Â¦e is dressed in rags
A frozen starving beggar band
Like rats we steal each other's scraps
Fall to fighting hand to hand 

Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with Bonaparte 

What dreams he made for us to dream
Spanish skies, Egyptian sands
The world was ours, we marched upon
Our little Corporal's command
And I lost an eye at Austerlitz
The sabre slash yet gives me pain
My one true love awaits me still
The flower of the aquitaine 

Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with Bonaparte 

I pray for her who prays for me
A safe return to my belle France
We prayed these wars would end all wars
In war we know is no romance
And I pray our child will never see
A little Corporal again
Point toward a foreign shore
Captivate the hearts of men

Mark Knopfler,"She was swinging by the bangles in a main street store
A while before we met
The most dangerous angels that you ever saw
She spied her amulet 

And she took a loop of leather for around her neck
And that was then the start
The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her Golden Heart
You found your Golden Heart 

Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
to some Arcadian band
I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
Just to hold time in my hand 

And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your Golden Heart
I'd hold your Golden Heart 

Nothing in the world prepared me for you, your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart
Your Golden Heart 

And every time I'm thinking of you from a distant shore
And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep 

And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me
I'll wear your Golden Heart

Forgive a knight who knows no shame

And I felt the blade of love so keen
And when you smiled you did me harm

Though they may never shine like his
There is no knight I would not kill

I did a warehouse stint for south sea girl
It was Hong Kong clothes for cash
Everybody got treated worse than trash
Punch the card in the company clock
Load the trolleys and the company trucks

And you couldn't sit down when there was nothing to do

I had everyone but me to blame
And every day was just the same
Well nobody ever said it was a righteous world

To make my mark upon the earth

A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
A Mason-Dixon Line

Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun

And I'd blown off almost everyone when my motor let go

Those walls from mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurt
So we came to Road America where we burned up at the lake
But at the speedway at Nazareth I made no mistake",Speedway at Nazareth
Mark Knopfler,"Big black cloud
On a yellow plain
Sure enough it
Looks like rain
Packin' up all our
Faith and trust
Me and the wanderlust

Empty bed and chair
Who's that callin'
Ain't nobody there
I look behind me
And I see there's just
Me and the wanderlust

Dead of night
I had a dream
Sky was bright yes and the
Fields were green
I was down the road
In a cloud of dust

Of an endless fall

Got to go now

Mark Knopfler,"The drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air

Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

   And it's what it is
It's what it is now

There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down

The lights are out in city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
It's what it is
It's what it is now

The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High up on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone

And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

And it's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now

There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours

On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick from my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell

Mark Knopfler,"Here's one of the two of us
In 1954 don't laugh
I keep all of the pictures
Are you going to take a photograph
Here's something nice for you
A dear old thing came to a show
Last time here we did
An interview on local radio

Make yourself at home my darling
Come on in
Hand me down that jar love
Can I offer you a gin

We're proud to be the oldest
Ugly sisters in variety
There's not the glamour now you see
What happened to society
There's another light bulb gone
They don't all answer to the switch
I don't know how we carry on
And her she couldn't care the bitch

But in a while the old boys
In the band began to play
And in a while the houselights
And the curtains slide away

And something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day
Something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day

Now the landlady's all squared away
It's just a temporary deal
I'm afraid tonight it's take-away
You see there is no evening meal
Don't worry dear you shall go to the ball
I think the fairy said
These suitcases have seen it all
From under someone else's bed

You want to smile those tears away
Now don't you cry
You want to know what I say
I say never say die

'cause something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day
Something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day

You have to believe in your own publicity
But you get yourself and agent
Hire the Albert Hall
Make like Humpty dumpty and look down on it all
But you're small potatoes
Strictly nickel and dime, nickel and dime

Out on the town for your charities
Hanging in around with the VIPS

Marched them up a hill of beans and down again
He was small potatoes

Mark Knopfler,"After two thousand came two thousand and one
To be the new champions we were there for to run
From springtime in Arizona till the fall in Monterey
And the raceways were the battlefields and we fought 'em all the way

Was at Phoenix in the morning I had a wake-up call
She went around without a warning put me in the wall
I drove Long Beach, California with three cracked vertebrae
And we went on to Indianapolis, Indiana in May

Well the Brickyard's there to crucify anyone who will not learn
I climbed a mountain to qualify I went flat through the turns
But I was down in the might-have-beens and an old pal good as died
And I sat down in Gasoline Alley and I cried

Well we were in at the kill again on the Milwaukee Mile
And in June up in Michigan we were robbed at Belle Isle
Then it was on to Portland, Oregon for the G.I. Joe
And I'd blown off almost everyone when my motor let go

New England, Ontario we died in the dirt
Those walls from mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurt
So we came to Road America where we burned up at the lake
But at the speedway at Nazareth I made no mistake",Speedway at Nazareth [Live]
Mark Knopfler,"We had no way of staying afloat
We had to leave on the ferry boat
Economic refugees
On the run to Germany

And humped it all from Newcastle to here

Why aye man, why aye, why aye man
Why aye man, why aye, why aye man

We're the nomad tribes, traveling boys
In the dust and dirt and the racket and the noise
Drills and hammers, diggers and picks
Mixing concrete, laying bricks
There's english, Irish, Scots, the lot
United nation's what we've got
Brickies, chippies, every trade
German building, British-made

Why aye man, why aye, why aye man
Why aye man, why aye, why aye man

Nae more work on Maggie's farm
Hadaway down the autobahn
Mine's a portacabin bed
Or a bunk in a Nissan hut instead

There's plenty deutschmarks here to earn
And German tarts are wunderschoen
German beer is chemical-free

Sometimes I miss my river tyne
But you're my pretty Fraulein

Mark Knopfler,"5.15 A.M. 
Snow laying all around 
A collier cycles home
From his night shift underground
Past the silent pub
Primary school, workingmen's club 
On the road from the pithead 
The churchyard packed 
With mining dead

Then beneath the bridge 
He comes to a giant car 
A shroud of snow upon the roof
A mark ten jaguar
He thought the man was fast asleep
Silent, still and deep
Both dead and cold
Shot through 
With bullet holes

The one armed bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from cockneyland 
E-type jags and flashy suits
Put your money in 
Pull the levers
Watch them spin
Cash cows in all the pubs
But he preferred the new nightclubs

Nineteen sixty-seven
Bandit men in birdcage heaven 
La dolce vita, sixty-nine
All new to people of the Tyne

Who knows who did what 
Somebody made a call
They said his hands 
Were in the pot
That he'd been skimming hauls
He picks up the swag
They gaily gave away
Drives his giant jag 
Off to his big pay day

The bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from cockneyland 
E-type jags and flashy suits
The bandit man
Came up the great north road
Up to geordieland
To mine 
The mother lode

Seams blew up or cracked
Black diamonds came hard won
Generations toiled and hacked 
For a pittance and black lung
Crushed by tub or stone
Together 
And alone
How the young and old 
Paid the price of coal

Eighteen sixty-seven
My angel's gone to heaven
He'll be happy there
Sunlight and sweet clean air

They gather round the glass 
Tough hewers and crutters
Child trappers and putters
The little foals and half-marrows
Who pushed 
And pulled the barrows
The hod boys 
And the rolleywaymen

No, you must have Hollywood

To go our different ways who went and wrote

This isn't what I'd want
Pullin' old night fighters

Oh, I'm like a lot of men

Now I'm stalkin' this old Doris
With lascivious intent
And I'm behind, behind with the rent

Just a little duck and dive
And a bit of wheel and deal
She'll remind me I'm alive
She'll remind me I still feel

Just a little shellin' out
For a bit of you-know-what
I know this is all about
Somethin' that I never got, oh

Well, this crumpet's past its sell-by-date
But they all would qualify
They're gonna be lonely

Not quite the movie star

My regulars trust me, seems
You can come and see Uncle to get through the week
Leave your pledges with me to redeem

Politicians go pawning their souls
Which doesn't make me look too bad, don't you know
Me with my heart full of holes

All my yesterdays broken, a watch with no face
All battered and old
Bits of the movement all over the place

At the knees-up in Teddy Boys? Row
The gold block and tackle tells the time upside down

Dead people?s wedding gifts, walk out the door
A clarinet squeals to be free
Accordions hop from the shelves to the floor
Start playing their polkas to me

there's a ringing of bells, a dunderhead?s curse
Fingers are pointing at you
And you take work in hell, be glad it?s not worse
And you get to the back of the queue

Handcuffs and hunting knives clang on the bars
Air pistols shoot out the lights
I've a whole wailing wall of electric guitars
Could shatter the windows down Brick Lane tonight

If one of us dies, love, I think I?ll retire
See my boys and my beautiful girls
Garden of Eden, no gates or barbed wire
Who knows, maybe gates made of pearls

Well, if we go to heaven, and some say we don't
But if there's a reckoning day
Please God, I?ll see You and maybe I won't
I've a bag packed to go either way

Redeeming your pledge, dear, I?ll keep it for you
It?s not gonna go anywhere
But your soul, your soul, that is not what I do
There's not a lot I can do there

I remember the officer?s watch in my hand
Repair it or die I was told
It?s a wonder to me, I still don't understand
Why I ever survived to be old

You've been away roamin' far away from here
Weathered a storm, your heart unafraid
Crossed every ocean in the boat that you made

Been blowin' your horn, scarin' the spooks
No crotchets or quavers in your books
Gone sailin' all night, straight in the vein
Like a bird on his own flight in his domain

In the sky
In the sky

Runnin' in on the tide with the first of the stars
The moon on the water and the sound of guitars
Glide into the homin' as the night falls
Tie up in the haven by the old harbor wall

And the hard-bitten stranger, deaf as a post
Who stands at the fire where a poet's dreams roast
He can't know the story, he can't feel the pain
And all of the glory falls around him like rain

In the sky
In the sky

you're a light in the dark, beacon of hope
And strong as a sea boat, strong as a rope
And the vagabond wind whispers over the bay
And the songs and the laughter are carried away

And I'd steal in a minute, I'm up to here in it
You here behaving as though I'm a saint

He doesn't like pictures with blotches and blots

Sweet nothings, the seaside with yachts

Here's the end of the thirties, no time for arties
Over in Poland, a right old to-do
So go join the navy, the air force or the army
They'll all be enrolling young fellows like you

Ringing expressions, the clamoring voice
It's volcanic desire, unquenchable fire
It isn't a question of having a choice

Anyway, now I'm old but if you won't be told
You've been created to answer the call
All passion and lust is gonna end in the dust

Down a yellow brick road

These days I get to where I'm going
Make it there eventually
Follow the trail of breadcrumbs
To where I'm meant to be
To where I'm meant to be

I don't know what brought you to me
That was up to you
There's so many come to see me
Who want their own tattoo
I fixed a needle in a holder
Laid my hand upon your spine
And there upon your shoulder
I drew the picture as your sign
When I think about us
I see the picture that we made
The picture to remind us

True love will never fade

True love will never fade

Now and then I think of you
Any which way we're all shufflin'
Forward in the queue

They like to get me off the pier
And I dream I'm on a steamer

The hang man steps in to do what hes paid for
With the wind down the tide she goes proud a head steaming
He drives her hard into the shore

Together we ride we did ride

A drift to a wave from her bows to her rudder
Bravely she rises to meet with the land
Under their feet you can feel the kings shudder
The shallow sea washes their hands
Later the captain shakes hands with the hangman
Climbs slowly down to the oily wet ground
Goes back to the car that has come here to take him
Through the graveyard back to the town

So far from the Clyde
Together we ride we did ride

They pull out her cables and hack off her hatches
Too poor to be wasteful with pity or time
They sworn on her carcass with torches and axes
Like a whale on a bloody shore line
Stripped of her pillars her stays and her stanchions
When their only her bones on the wet poison land
Steal rods will drag her with winces and engines

Mark Knopfler,"The high priest of money looks down on the river
The dawn coming up on his kingdom of gold
When the rim of the sun sends an arrow of silver
He prays to the gods of the bought and the sold

He turns to his symbols, his ribbons of numbers
They circle and spin on their mystical scroll
He looks for a sign while the city still slumbers
And the ribbons and the river forever unroll
In his kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold

On the horizon an enemy haven
Sends traces of smoke high up into the sky
A pack of dog jackals and a rabble of ravens
Who'll come for his fortress, his castle on high
In his kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold

His axes and armour will conquer these devils
The turbulent raiders will falter and fall
Their leaders be taken, their camps burned and levelled
They'll hang in the wind from his citadel walls
In his kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold

They're looking too close up in here
Pulling down the blinds
But they'll let you stay a while
And I'm going, in a while

Now I've got leave you, brother
So this round's mine
Just looking at you, anyhow
You can go on and have another
You wouldn't, call time
I'm gonna say my goodbye's now

Mark Knopfler,"My Saturday job pays six and six down
A copy boy at the Chronicle
Five cigarettes and two silver half crowns
Meeting Vince at Mark Toney’s in town
Boy, do we get around

Basil sits there on the table for subs
But not a part of the Bri-nylon club
Ancient blue sweater, too old for the job
Bored out of his mind
With the Colins and Bobs

I’m a jack and a lad
And I’m up for the world
And I’ve kissed a Gateshead girl

He calls for a copy boy, grumpy as hell
Poets have to eat as well
What he wouldn’t give just to walk out today
To have time to think about time
And young love thrown away

I’m a jack and a lad
And I’m up for the world
And I’ve kissed a Gateshead girl

Starlings swarming
A cloud over Grainger Street
Over the black church
Over the Black Gate
And the shadowy Keep

He peers through his wire rims
At the fish and chip words
He’s supposed to dish up and forget
His drudgery now has become slightly blurred
By one of his Players untipped cigarettes

Bury all joy
Put the poems in sacks
And bury me here with the hacks

In the summer the fair
Will stretch over the Moor
Lovers will lie and make out in the park
Basil puts on his old duffel and scarf
And goes out into the dark",Basil
Mark Knopfler,"She likes a man with a broken nose
Lucky for me, I suppose
Shots coming in like the monthly bills
Soon they’ll be saying I’m over the hill

Well the bell goes clang and you’re on your own
You take your medicine and go home
You take it like a man, on the chin
And you don’t make a fuss when the towel comes in

Now let me go home, got to lay in ice
And I don’t want to hear no more advice
Just give me my clothes
Get me out of this place
How many more stitches in my face?

Broken bones, you carry 'em home

And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared

Well, the holes in the walls
Were such a lot
Welcome to London town
But when you're new to it all
And you think you're hot
You're not planning on hanging around
People would go on their different ways
I left to start a band
A note came through the letter box
In your childlike hand

Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared

One day I rode to where you were
The doorbell jangled a note
They buzzed me in
I climbed the stairs
In my boots and leather coat
There's an old brass
Standing there at the top
Without her witch's broom
It almost seemed like a knocking shop
When the girls came out of their rooms

And they all stood around
And stared at me
Two brunettes and a blonde
Then the old brass shrugged and said
We don't know where she's gone
Later on I picked up the ball
And I took off down the line
I suppose by then I'd realised
You'd run into hard times

Mark Knopfler,"There’s laughter in the darkness
Music floating in across the bay
He’s half listening and wondering
How he could have let her slip away
So long ago but still he wants to know
If anyone has seen her
And he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina

They were young and love was shining
Like the colours of the rainbow
Desire felt like choking
Love was smoking under the volcano
He can still taste her kisses
Sweet as the red wine from Messina
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina

Seems like another lifetime
When they rambled along the shore
Seems like another lifetime
She used to call him her sweet senor
Maybe in another lifetime
On a pathway to the sea
Maybe there they’ll be

The crowd calls for the emperor
Raise their hands to hail another king
But he’s been so long a wanderer
Another crowd can never mean a thing
He came, he saw, he conquered
Ten thousand voices roared in the arena
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina

He hears the chimes of history
Myths of gods and men forever ringing
Ancient dreams in all their mystery
Wars for Sicily and Spartan women
In the mists of antiquity
Ships of war set sail from Carthagina
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina

In England as well

In a misty November
We had the worst of the lodgings
And we hated the subs

I will always remember
And we wouldn’t get paid
Until they had closed up their pubs

And I could stand up on horseback
Was the man for the singing
Put my hand up for boxing
At the fairground on the heath
I could play my accordion
And charm all of the women
And dance round the taproom

To meet my boat
It ain’t the life of Riley

It’s quiet over Christmas
If you got no place to go
I got my home from river rats
The only home I know

I found myself a flophouse
And I hit the streets at nine

And I just let her work me over
Down by the Ohio

When I asked her if she’d like to stay
She was down my stairs so quick

Mark Knopfler,"It was so late and she’d be sleeping
He came through her home town
With the moonlight on the crossroads
And the green light shining down
And the bell at the railroad crossing
And the horn from far away
And his Silver Eagle passing
Half a mile from where she lay

At his feet a sea of faces
Make devotions with their love
Clap their hands and plead their cases
Call for blessings from above
Like the rolling waves forever massing
To crash and foam and creep away
And the Silver Eagle passing
Half a mile from where she lay

Road signs flow into the headlights
Whisper names and fall behind
He finds some honor in the darkness
Hopes for grace and peace of mind
And he thinks of how they’d lay together
He’d run his fingers through her hair
And he wonders if she’ll ever
Come to know that he was there",Silver Eagle
Mark Knopfler,"I’ve been banned from every racecourse in the country
There’s something about the unsure thing
Like scoring with a beauty of the county

It’s got to be the unsure thing
In the Bentley Continental with the brandy

Dive Bomber in the 2.15
All on the nose and no-one counting
Nothing wishy-washy in between

To take a winding road that I could see
It was just like being given an incredible permission

While the shame in your heart
Remains

Cryin' were the eyes of a child
In pain, tonight
Tears that I bled on you
From the heart of an angel of fear, tonight
We can wander, we could stray
But the shame remains

See through the eyes of a child
And it won't be real
I have loved your eyes
Neither hateful or cruel
No lies conceal
We could wander, we could stray
But the shame, has remained
Has remained
It has remained",Eyes of a Child

Mark Lanegan,"Went out last night, take a little round
Met little Sadie and I blowed her down
Then I run right home and went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

The girls all heard little Sadie was dead
They went home to be ragged in red
Come a slippin' and a slidin' down the street
In their loose mother hubbards and their stocking feet

Well I began to think what a deed I'd done
Grabbed my hat and I started to run
I made a good run just a little too slow
And they overtook me in Jericho

Standing on the corner reading a bill
Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
Said young man is your name Lee Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Sadie down?

Yes I said my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in a first degree
First degree and a second degree
If ya got any papers, read 'em to me

Took me downtown, dressed me in black
Put me on a train and send me back
Didn't have no one to go on my bail
Throw me back in the county jail

Judge and the jury took their stand
Judge had the papers in his hand
Forty-one days and forty-one nights
Forty-one years just to wear them stripes",Little Sadie

Is a wearisome one
Though some say it's free from care
It's the swinging of an axe
From morning 'till night

From a lady so fair
To the banks of some lonely stream
Where the wolf, bear, and owl
Give a terrifying howl
And disturb our nightly dreams

Oh sleeping at night
In our bunks without cheer
While the cold winter winds do blow
But as soon as the morning 
Star does appear
To the wild woods we must go

Had we ale, wine, or beer
Our spirits far to cheer
When we're in those woods so wild
Where a glass of whiskey shone
When we're in the woods alone
For to pass away our long exile

Night lays me down when I'm fading
When I can't go home because they hate me

Has grown to be a deep sea diver

Lost her head and it went bad
Blue her two eyes they were dead
Mirror mine and see she said
One of these mornings
I don't know her
One of these mornings I think I owe her
Head
Once she signed a piece of my mind
Girlie scenes and gasoline
Porno pony she did ride
Forsaken long lost limousine
I hear her talkin'
I like to hear her talkin'
See her walkin'
I like to watch watch her come walkin'

Head 
She lost it and man did it get bad
Lazy eyes were dead
Mirror mine and see she said
Once she drew a picture
Stuck it in my pocket
Find somewhere to reach her

See her walkin'
I like to watch, watch her come walkin'

Down kingdom come and the acid ban
I'm Babylon, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it

In Marianne I dug the hole
And watched her trip on my heart of stone
And in the end all that crawled, was my skin
I couldn't kill it
I hit the city

To the promised land and the dark descents
I'm Babylon, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it

I wouldn't bleed

While I'm getting off the plane

And for much I was to blame
But when I heard the news that night
I went down like a satellite
And when my world stood still that night
I dropped like a satellite

She never knew how much I cared

And twilight falls again
To the funny sound that a blackbird makes

But I can't say how or when

There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be right
Something good
From my fingertips, the cigarette throws ashes to the ground
I'd stop and talk to the girls who work this street, but I got business farther down
Like one long season of rain, I will remain

From far away a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it

Crawls to a stop and starts again
Those highlights you've forced to shine
Show me my way through wilderness
And someday far from here I'll send a kiss
Out of nowhere
At times you see a ghost down on the street
Walks the hallway knocking door to door
Where are you from night til  nine a.m.
Only a dark skinned Jesus knows
Why suddenly your room is turnin' cold
Cold is nowhere
And as it ends so it begins

Stared down the past and just scarred my eyes
Now I know there's no easy ride
She's been the kind who would take it in stride
Some jack of diamonds kicked her heart around
Did they know they were walking on holy ground?
Almost called it a day so many times
Didn't know what it felt like to be alive

I can’t escape my mind

From a broken bough
Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down
This house is an empty place
So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It’s always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it’s what fate decides
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I’m older

Here come the lonely night
Can’t escape my mind

And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had

Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind

I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
Once I cried like a clown
Now I’m older

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Mark Lindsay,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

Mark Lindsay,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Mark Marino,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Mark Marino,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Mark Marino,"Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses, morning me, evening me
And as the world slips far away, a star away
Forever me with love

Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love

And every day I'll gentle you, tender you
And, oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine

Suddenly, magically, we found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me, always

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

It's good to see somebody so in love
When they walked out together
I just sat there all alone
I thought God I hate that woman
But I love the one at home

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short sexy dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

It's like a bad movie
That's lasted too long
It's all about her
But it has to be wrong

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short sexy dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

Believe me she doesn't dance",She Doesn't Dance
Mark McGuinn,"Everybody wants to make it up to Heaven
But they don't want to die
Everybody wants seven or eleven
Without rollin' the dice
Just want somethin' for nothin'
Buy one, just to get one free
Or be the first to take someone's lovin'
And not back anything

[Chorus: ]
It don't work that way
There's a price you have to pay
It don't work that way
You gotta step up to the plate
Can't hit a home run
Without being the batter
You won't find your gold
On a silver platter

Everybody wants to win the blue ribbon
Without running the race
Everybody wants to have a perfect body
Without lifting a weight
Rather make a million dollars
Not the old fashioned way
Spend a buck the pick six numbers
Now all I have to say

[Chorus: ]",Silver Platter
Mark McKay,"Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last
Night now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

[Chorus]
Everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

[Chorus]

Now our luck may have died and out love may
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday
Comes back

Mark McKay,"You wait in the car
On the side of the road
Let me go and stand awhile
I want to know you're there, but I want to be alone
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind

I walked out in a field:
The grass was high, it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
And a farmhouse out a-ways
And I wondered about the people who live there
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
Did she love him and take her hair down at night?

If I stray away too far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It don't mean I don't love you
It don't mean I won't come back and stay beside you
It only means I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I used to always go

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Mark Morganelli,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Letting all the people know

And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully

Down came Bill Jocko
From the heart of Hooterville
Take down your Christmas tree
But I know that you never will
Riding lover was his lady,
And she did not know his mind
When Billy took the Datsun 
To the top for the last time
And that’s when they were
Drunk on wine coolers
That they stole from her mother
Drunk on the Summer
And drunk on each other

You better take a right at the graveyard
And a left over at the ghetto
Climb up to where it’s dark
And gonna take all of our clothes off
Lucinda had her head down,
Braiding her hair so she could not see,
That William had his eyes closed,
Headin’ straight for a tree,
And that’s when they were

Drunk on wine coolers
That they stole from her mother
Drunk on the Summer
And drunk on each other

One, or two, or three hundred feet down to the ground
Let’s do it now when there ain't no park ranger hangin' ‘round

He cut the wheel on banana peels,
We’re goin’ straight into a skid
Shut off the motor, and gone straight off of the ridge
They hit hard, like a broken wand,
And Lucinda she was dead

Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad",My Favorite Things
Mark Murphy,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

From Memphis to St. Jo,

Mark Murphy,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

My own true love to me

Mark Murphy,"Love is wrong.
It sings a hopeless song.
It longs for bitter disappointment and tears and tears.
It calls to all that used to be,
And it yearns for someone who was tender but untrue.

Love is blind.
It's helplessly inclined,
To bind itself to discontentment and fears and fears.
It dwells on nights that might have been.
Love needs nothing more to do.

My darling

So, I hold each little token we knew, we knew.
Endlessly I unfold, each word we've spoken,
We two, we two.

Love is mad.
It's beautiful but bad.
It gladly weeps when disillusion appears, appears.
And so I cling to yesterdays,
While I'm hopelessly in love,
While I'm hopelessly in love,

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Mark Murphy,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Mark Murphy,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him

Mark Murphy,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell

And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart,

That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start,

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart,

In the darkest pits of hell the devil hatched an evil plan
To tempt the fiddle player for he's just a mortal man
""The sin of pride,"" the devil cried is what will do you in
""I thought we had this settled, I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny did you ever know that time keeps marching on
The coldest hour is the one comes just before the dawn
The devil's back in Georgia will you stand up to the test
Or will you let the devil be the best?

""In truth I haven't played much since the baby came in June
But give me half a minute an' I'll get this fiddle back in tune""

The devil grabbed the golden fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
""Though I'm the fiddle player underground and I walk upon the land""

""Y'all just better be just turnin' back if you want this boy to win
'Cos practice is the only cure for the predicament he's in""

""Now devil it would be a sin for you to get my bow
You go on back to hell and to the wood shed I will go""

Johnny are you practising or will your hands grow cold?
The devil walks the land and plays a fiddle made of gold
Can you hear the babe a crying, will he ever know
The devil wants his daddy's very soul?

""Before we play I want to thank you for letting God's own Word ring true
He said you can't be trusted"" ""Yes but what you gonna do?""
""Well you get your fiddle devil if you think that you can win
'Cos I beat you once you old dog and I can whip your butt again""

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

CHORUS:

Nobody told us we should steer clear

There's mud on our feet and the grass

It tastes like turpentine

Down at Ben Johnson's Creek

There's a broken pipeline that spills into the water

We go out walking one day

And a couple of mean old boys come up to us and say

Ben Johnson's now public domain

We tried to pay him off but all he wanted was to stay


REPEAT CHORUS


We like Ben Johnson's place

There's white table grapes and his mother planted these

Now all these willows will go

Ben Johnson held out as long as a body can hold


REPEAT CHORUS


Down at Ben Johnson's Creek

There's a broken pipeline that spills into the water

CHORUS:

But God had a plan so he saved your Diamond Dave

He threw him a line

And he brought him back home

A chain link fence was sent by one who cares

And keeps His eyes on things

He landed right smack on a 20,000 acre lettuce patch

He had to walk back all soaking wet


REPEAT CHORUS


He wasn't the first and he won't be the last

There's no time for letters in a concrete riverbed

And a van came by when he was walking back

But they never did stop

They had some other business

Oh Diamond Davey sang in the choir on a summer's day

And I was there to hear him say


REPEAT CHORUS


Diamond Davey jumped into the California aqueduct

Into the river that man made

Into the river that man made


",Diamond Davey
Mark Olson,"Don't I love my summer sunshine
Don't I love my summer sunshine
I went walking down a road
A thief came by and stole my clothes
Be there if I could
Don't know how I should
Leave my own family
Oh my Africa letter sends you a song
Oh we were such good friends back then
We dug ditches in the sun
And we worked hard the whole day long
I miss the songs too
And I miss that small kitchen
Where we would talk some
Oh my Africa letter sends you a song
Everyday I try to keep
All the good things
In front of me yeah
But our roads have crumbled
Hope our worlds have tumbled
All the way around

And just then called your name

Mark Olson,"There's a meeting in Lone Pine today and no one knows
See the wind along the highway how it goes
And some days the trucks roll over
There's a bistash orchard hidden in the Yucca mountains
See the heartbreak in the farmer he is told
These are hard times to start over
Lets climb to the top of this dried grass hill
Before we rambled there was silence
There's silence still
Why do you suppose he waits by the road
All he wanted was to land a little farm
There's a meeting in Lone Pine
He'll have to start over
And who'll be there to guide us
There's a dollar bill that costs a lot of dawn in some
In the ground is water moving all around
Let's climb to the top of this dried grass hill
Before we rambled there was silence
There's silence still
Why do you suppose he waits by the road
All he saved for was to land a little farm
There's a meeting in Lone Pine

Why is this day like no other day
Oh you've waited so long
To be sure love is all
And the first flowers bloom ? back on the farm
The windows were warm
Back home the windows are frozen shut
Glad that you showed me how
To get out of the cold
And you almost had a house there in Mendocino
We used to drive through the countryside
And I will miss your dear sweet smile
All the while
I'll see you again
My own Jo Ellen someone who knows
Someone just as long you've been around
There's an empty old sound
Like the day coming down

There's a lot of light

But no rain in the sky

A friend comes by and we keep him inside

The dogs are chasing the furrows


CHORUS:

If you look now you'll see I'm on your side

Each cloud that passes us by

Trying to find the rainbows of your heart

Hope all these words I say will hurry home

And I'll show you that I care

There's an off road down in the wash

The blackbirds stayed all winter long

We dragged out an old army cot

We faced it east to see the sun rise

There's no red sky this morning

Rosalee won't even leave her home

She's scared she won't get back

Inside the door

Rivers will bend people sometimes get stuck in

The whirling cloud

You'll have to show her how to get around

Rosalee can talk a mean blue streak

There's fifty reasons why she won't go see

The way the world will change

Can get under someone's skin

When it changes on them

You'll have to show her how to get around

Someone there to tell you it's alright

Won't make the town seem so far

If you won't feel so all alone

You're no longer hiding inside your home

Winds blowing inside of the car

There's a dust storm rising ten feet tall

It's a wonder we don't make this trip more

Foolish I guess

You'll have to show her how to get around

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

Won't make the town seem so far

But you won't feel so all alone

You're no longer hiding inside your home


There's someone there to tell you it's alright

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

Mark Olson,"Broken string that could be tied together
Houses need paint that stand out there by the river
Once I knew a child back then
Who spent all day long in the kitchen
Holding hands
He had someone to talk with
Who brings the sunshine that keeps us warm
Who brings the rain that washes down the road
Someone who knows most of what you need
Before you lost it by yourself
When you can't believe
Trouble drops like a stone
Don't go sinking your tomorrows

There's a snow melt stream that could stand up ??? toothpicks??
There's an inner tube tire that's punctured and needs fixin'

Keep looking for 49 Palms
Honeybee honeybees
In every tree there's honeybees
Do you remember how we hid from the sun
Behind a rock there
Abandoned shack out on 62
There must be morning doves that live there
Morning doves morning doves
In your eyes there's morning doves
Do you remember how we hid from the sun
Behind a rock there
Both carried a jar of water
Running into each other
Both carried a jar of water
Running into each other
Running through a canyon in the sun
Everything that's down here that turns to a lake of salt

A path for my feet
When I was around you
What's found is yours to keep

Say that I'm your one and only
This love I have for you
I must have watched from your garden
Oh, say you're home to stay

You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around

Many times that I wondered
I was right for me to do
Stand out on my corner
Hoping my sweets will lead to you

Just inside of your glory
Like the time and time before
Never meant to beg or borrow
Sleep outside your hidden door

You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around

When we put our arms 'round each other
It's not hard to tell
That you're loving someone else

Through the valley of a roadside.
Taking a walk through the valley of a roadside,
On a sunny afternoon.
Smoking a smoke.
Through the streets of a poppy field.
Smoking a smoke, through the streets of a poppy field,
On a sunny afternoon.
I'm travelling down a man made avenue;
There's a stop sign this time, I'm going through.
Are you with me,
On my journey?
Are you with me, in the search for the sunshine,
On a sunny afternoon?
Now I'm driving in my car,
Down the path of a hillside,
On a sunny afternoon.
Holding your hand,
Down a lane made for lovers,
On a sunny afternoon.
I'm travelling down a man made avenue;
There's a stop sign, this time I'm going through.
