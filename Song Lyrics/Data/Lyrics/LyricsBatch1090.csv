Phil Spector,"There is a land I know where lovers go
And flowers grow forever more
Where time is standing still and lovers fill
The quiet places by the shore

We will cross the rainbow
To a place where we'll be free
Where he'll give his love to me
So I'll wait for the day when he takes me away to

(Paradise)
He'll take me by the hand to
(Paradise)
We'll walk along the sand in
(Paradise)
A never never land
(Paradise)
Wo wo wo

We'll build a castle there so we can share
The happiness we've waited for
While white flamingos fly way up high
Way above the ocean's roar

We will climb a mountain
To see our wonderland
Maybe now you'll understand
Why I've waited for the day when he takes me away to

(Paradise)
He'll take me by the hand to
(Paradise)
We'll walk along the sand in
(Paradise)
A never never land
(Paradise)
Wo wo wo

(Stand by him)
I'll stand by him
(Do right by him)
Do right by him
And I swear that I would die for him, die for him

(Paradise)
He'll take me by the hand to
(Paradise)
We'll walk along the sand in
(Paradise)
Oh oh oh
(Paradise)
Oh oh oh oh

Phil Spector,"If I dance every dance with the guy 
Who gives me the eye let him hold me tight
If I smile every smile for the man 
Who holds my hand 'neath the pale moonlight
I won't forget who's takin' me home
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine 
Like sparklin' wine, and I'll have some fun
I'll laugh and sing, but while we're apart
I won't give my heart to anyone
And I won't forget who's takin' me home
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so 
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never, ever let you go
I love you oh, so much

If I dance, and I carry on 'til the night is gone
And it's time to go

I will tell him no

Phil Spector,"Well, he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered I love you
He said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before,
He kissed me in a way that I want to be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mon and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me",Then He Kissed Me

'Bout my baby, how I love him so

There's no other like my baby

Phil Spector,"All of these nights that we've been a dating
All of these nights that we've been awaiting
Something tells me that the time is getting right
Each time we kiss it takes a little bit longer
And my love for you gets a little bit stronger
And I feel like I'm-a-sittin' on dynamite
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

When it comes to lovin' she's a natural master
And each night she's there well my heart beats faster
Deep down inside I know the best is yet to come
Oh oh gonna pick her up about a quarter to seven
I know were gonna take a little trip to heaven
And if it's love she wants then I'm gonna give her some
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

I'll be good to him, I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day when I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him is to love, love, love him
And I do

Why can't he see, how blind can he be
Someday he'll see that he was meant for me, oh yes

To know, know, know him is to love, love, love him

I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
""Wait for me, wait for me""
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling

Phil Spector,"Little boy, you probably don't know it
But on the night we met
You stole my heart away

Little boy, can't help it if I show it
But I wish that you would love me too
Just as much as I love you

Then I know you would see
That you were meant for me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl

Little boy, I hope you do believe me
'Cause it would break my heart
If you should walk away

Little boy, just say you'll never leave me
And I'll give my heart and soul to you
Then you'll see our love is true

Yes, and I know you'll see
How much you mean to me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl

I just want to go every place that you go
And do everything that you do
I just want to know everyone that you know
Then spend my whole life loving you

Yes, and I know you'll see
How much you mean to me

And he goes downtown
Where everyone's his boss
And he's lost in an angry land
He's a little man

But then he comes uptown
Each ev'nin' to my tenement

To pay much rent
And when he's there with me
He can see that he's everything
Then he's tall, he don't crawl
He's a king

Downtown he's just one of a million guys
He don't get no breaks
And he takes all they got to give
'Cause he's got to live

But then he comes uptown
Where he can hold his head up high
Uptown he knows that I am standing by
And when I take his hand
There's no man who could put him down

Felt somethin' I ain't never felt

But we knew somethin' just got
Set in motion

[Chorus]
How could we have known
We were standin' on the edge
Of forever
We didn't know where this was goin'
But we were together and that
Was enough
And when the sun came up
Yeah, it was looking like love
No time to wonder
What lied past the curve of the earth
Our place on that grass
It fell out of nowhere
It happened so fast
We were just holdin' on

So free, runnin' on young and innocent

Baby, here we are
Lookin' back on where we started

Like love
It was looking like love
Yeah, baby",Looking Like Love
Phil Stacey,"You keep closing your eyes
Trying to ignore it
Hoping it'll disappear
Face to face with your own Goliath
At least that's how it looks from here
All the stones you can throw
Won't scare it away

And pacing back and forth
Trying to think of something
To get you to the other side
The path of your fear
Runs in all directions
When you're looking for a place to hide
But you know the one you've
Gotta take

There's no way around a river, baby
Wade on in the deep
And when you can't go any further
Hold on to me
And if it pulls you under
I'll be there too
There's no way around a river, baby
It's just something you've gotta
Go through

The troubles you face
The wounds you're protecting
The sins that you wrestle with
We all have our share we'd like to
Get over
Sometimes there's just no bridge
And the very thing that makes
Us afraid
Is just what we need to wash it away

That's the way it is
So just wade on in
I'll see you on the other side
No way around it
No way around a river, baby

What went wrong the other night
When you called me
Oh, why did you call me

And take a walk down memory lane
Catch up on life
Oh, since the day we died
Girl, I don't know about you
As for me, I'm still going through

I don't know why I can't move on
And just let this go
Girl, would you let me know
What it is I have to do
To keep from going through

You know that I'd do anything, to keep you holding me
Baby, I would stop the world and take you in
And I would do it all again, to love you even more

That's what I'm fighting for, yeah ah
You're what I'm fighting for

So many people yearning
Wake up a wanting more
They break their backs
To find exactly what their not looking for
They sacrifice a diamond to gain a lot of coal
And end up holding only, never letting go

When every little thing that I have dreamed would be
Just slips away like water through my hand
And when it seems the walls of my belief are crashing down

Like they're all made of sand
I won't let go of You now, because I know You're not shaken
I'm trembling in the darkness of my own fear

I'm here And I may never know why I may not understand

Phil Sunkel,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Nobody's happy with the way things are
Looking for the quick fix, the short term loan
Got to rent ?cause you might not be here long enough to own
The way I see it the trouble with the world these days
It's getting way too easy just to drive away

With you and me baby it's up and down
We're moving the earth or we're on shaky ground
We talk about forever when it's all going smooth
Or moving out tomorrow if things don't improve
Well the way I see it the trouble with love these days
It's gotten way too easy just to drive away

And you can drive away
If you've got half a mind to and half a tank you can
Drive away
First sign of trouble first little thing goes wrong
You can climb in your car and drive till you're gone

Whatever we've got it's worth the risk
To read a little promise into every kiss
You pay for the music but you do get to dance
When you love somebody it's not that big a chance
The way I see it we've got every reason to stay
And every reason to go together if we drive away

And we can drive away
If we need to start again, that's ok, we can
Drive away
Till we find that place where we can live on faith
That we'll never again have to drive away

Phil Vassar,"Joe and rosalita, look'em up in the year book
Even then they had that wild-in-love crazy look
Joe's car on friday night, after the ball game

They could write their names
They'd fight like cats and dogs outside of homeroom
See'em hangin' all over each other that same afternoon

Old mr.rosenbaum kicked'em out of the senior prom
Busted for dirty dancin'
Sent him home and he called her mom
Pulled the old pillow trick, and they both snuck out
Showed up two days later still in a tux and a prom gown
Got married on the steps outside the courthouse
Called it the great escape, people still talk about it now

Now it's been 10 years for rose and joe

Still got his arm around her, two kids in the backseat
They book a babysitter to go out on friday
Sometimes they never even make it out of the driveway

With a second hand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere Virginia who'd ever figure
That kid in the yard would go very far

?Cause 419 Lakewood had no silver spoons
Just an old beat up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings I thank god I was

?Cause dreams can grow wild
Born inside an American child

7 lbs. 3 oz she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came

But in '45 he fell down beside

Phil Vassar," I went back in time today a box I thought
I'd thrown away
Had fallen off the basement shelf,
I tripped and almost hurt myself
Scattered there across the floor
A New Year's Eve hat from '94
Ticket stubs to Billy Joel and pictures
From the Sugar Bowl
Some of these souvenirs I remember
Mostly I don't 
It's funny how time reduces a keepsake 
To a footnote

The wheres and the whens that meant
So much then
Have gracefully moved along
My memory had mercy on me and let me go on
Considering everything you meant I thought
I never would forget

Here's us dancing on your birthday
July 29th or 28th
The song was ""Always and Forever,""
I'm not sure but I remember
That's the night we first made love
The passion captured both of us
It held us, then it set us free,
This is all that's left of you and me
A cardboard treasure chest with a diary
Of two lovers
Now it's a dusty old box no different

Phil Vassar,"Well maybe lately I've been acting a little bit strange
And maybe there's a few things I need to explain
So what if I call you at work for no reason
And I sent you those flowers today
So what if my friends tell me they never see me
And everyone's sayin' I've changed

If you think I always think about you
And I dream about you day and night
If you think for a moment I can't live without you
And maybe I've fallen in love with you
Baby, you're right
Baby, you're right

Somehow, somewhere I went and crossed over the line
And I let you see the man that was hiding inside
It's highly irregular, I must confess
No this usually isn't my style
Oh I know my heart's beatin' out of my chest
And I just can't do nothin' but smile

If you think I always think about you
And I dream about you day and night
If you think for a moment I can't live without you
And maybe I've fallen in love with you
Baby, you're right

Baby, you're so wrong if you think
That you're holdin' on just a little too tight
But, if you're believin' that I'm never leavin' you
Baby, you're right

If you think I always think about you
And I dream about you day and night
If you think for a moment I can't live without you
And maybe I've fallen in love with you
If you think that I'm hopeless without you
There's no way I can put up a fight

So much confusion, so many shades of gray
Sometimes I don't know, my left from my right
But I've got these old black and whites

Well I'm every color that you can paint
A father, a lover, a mother, and a sinner and a saint
From Sunday mornin', to Saturday night
I've got these old black and whites

Under the spotlight or all alone at midnight
I know I'm right where I belong
It always unwinds me, it finds me, then reminds me
That life, is as simple as a song

Lovers they come and surely they go
They fly you so high say hello say goodbye
They leave you low
But that's all right here in these songs that I write
All right here on these old black and whites

Under the spotlight or all alone at midnight
I know I'm right where I belong
It always unwinds me, it finds me and reminds me

Phil Vassar,"We were eighteen and nineteen
And paired off on Saturday nights
Down in the basement, big killer stereo
Dimmer switch on the lights

Jane was a dancer, Paul was a drummer
Christine was a doctor to be
Life stretched out before us like one endless summer
And that brings us to me
I was the gypsy

[Chorus]
We sang as we stood at the gate
We were ready to take the world on
Four young soldiers of fate
Couldn't wait to go right every wrong
Wearing our passion, our hopes
Out t-shirts and jeans
Dancin' with dreams

Ten years ago May we all drank to the future
And all went out separate ways
I packed up to go with my clothes and piano
And music and something to say

I hear Paul owns a drum shop
Jane teaches ballet
And Christine's an ob-gyn
I'm writing songs that I sing in a cafe
And sometimes I write about them
I miss my friends

And nothin was out of our reach

And now, I see the power and the promise
In commitment to your love
That's something I could never have done

Phil Vassar,"What's become of our two hearts, lately we just play the parts
We say the lines but there's no spark
We never miss a cue, but it's a passionless walk-through
""I love you"" doesn't mean so much when there's no fire behind it
It was just here I know it was, it must be hiding

[Chorus]
Behind the door, inside the house
Between the pillows on the couch
Under the bed, up on some shelf
Behind these walls be built ourselves
It didn't vanish in thin air
It's got to be around here somewhere

It ain't like we don't talk, it ain't like we don't walk the walk
We see our friends, we fool them all
We edit everything we say, I hate to think of us this way
The love we made was strong, remember just how sweet it tasted
It's not really gone, we've only carelessly misplaced it

[Chorus]

Well, it can't be gone, it can't be gone, it's just
Behind the door, inside the house
Between the pillows on the couch
Under the bed, up on some shelf
Behind these walls we built ourselves
Under the sun behind the moon

She's got a booty tattoo, red lips and a tongue
Well, some girls just know how to have fun
Start me up, sugar, let the tumbling dice roll
My baby, rocks like the Rolling Stones

My little backstage beauty queen knows how to dance
She's got a backwood boogie and a Hollywood glance
Got it shake, shake, shaking baby, all night long
Got everybody just dancing along
She's buck wild, she's bad to the bone

Last night, I kissed her and she slapped my face
It was her, her twin sister standing in her place, yeah

It's only love.

Don't give me that poor pitiful sorry I broke your heart look
Don't act like it's something I can't live without that you took

I'm stronger than that.
I'm gonna spring right back like a rubber band
I know that I can

It's only love it ain't nothing
But oxygen and water
Sun to the sunlight

Cause it ain't nothing I can't rise above
It's only love

I'm not surprised baby I'm caught a little off guard
But I will survive it'll just leave amendable scar
If this is what you want I wish you well

And night moons on the stereo
The windows down and the smell of fresh cut hay

The stories she'd tell
About broken hearts and love and raising hell

And those were the days in my Chevrolet.

Jenny was an angel, she was my first love
Steaming up the windows and getting all tangled up
Stumble round in the darkness trying to find our way
Hey, at the drive in movies
We parked way up at the back
I couldn't tell you what was playing
I didn't care nothing about that
And after that we hit the road
And parked down by the lake in my Chevrolet.

Phil Vassar,"Daddy put in his forty years, got his gold watch, and then they sent him home.
I never knew what a struggle was like until I cried tears on his stone.

Well I go to work,
My boss is a jerk.
I try my best,
But my feelings get hurt.

They treat me like dirt.
The only thing worse,
Is I need the money honey.

I gotta tell you it's been pretty hard
But every now and then, I turn around

The more you find you have to learn

Phil Vassar,"On a plane to the West Coast, laptop on my tray
Papers spread across my seat, a big deadline to make
An older man sitting next to me said, ""Sorry to intrude,
Thirty years ago my busy friend, I was you.
I made a ton of money and I climbed up the ladder,
Yeah, I was superman, not what does it matter.

I missed the first steps my daughter took
The time my son played Captain Hook in 'Peter Pan'
I was in New York, said 'Sorry son, Dad has to work'
I missed the father daughter dance
The first home run, no second chance
To be there when he crossed the plate
The moment's gone now it's too late
Fame and fortune come with a heavy price
Son, don't miss your life.""

Funny you should say that, I was sitting at the gate
My daughter called, she made straight A's and they're off to celebrate.
Scrolling through the pictures of my little family
My daughter with her mom and friends, not a single one with me.
They know I love 'em, I know they know I care
The truth is half the time, I'm not even there.

I missed our fourth and fifth anniversary
Our girl was early by a week
Her sister had to hold her hand
I was in L.A., she said ""I understand""
I missed her first day of school
Then what kind of crazy fool
Lets such precious moments pass
We all know time goes way too fast
Hold on tight ‘cause it don't happen twice
Don't miss your life.

When I get off this plane, I'll buy a turn-around ticket
Saturday's her eighth birthday and I'm not gonna miss it

There'll be balloons and birthday cake
And I'll clean up the mess they make
My mom and dad are drivin' in
I haven't seen 'em in God knows when
My wife will probably say to me
""I thought you were supposed to be in Portland
For a few more days"", I'll take her in my arms and say

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing

And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

And green leaves turn to gold
Then I remember last September
You and I said goodbye
Whispering that we would be returning
When autumn comes again

Now autumn roams the hills once more
But you forgot your vow
Now here am I with, alone with only memories
Only lonely memories, autumn memories of you

I get a hungry yearning for your arms
Love, when a heart is so blue
It shadows bright October's golden charm

Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make
My autumn dreams come true

Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou
Phil Woods,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Phil Woods,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Phil Woods,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

So that you too will understand

Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

Before the big top crashes down
Before you pack away my trunk case
I'd like to take a final bow

One last chance to hear the laughter
And to see your face there in the crowd
One last moment in the spotlight
One last chance to be your clown

I guess you're tired of walking tightropes
Of settin' up and tearing down
You want a place to call forever
And rest your feet on solid ground

Somewhere you lost that sense of wonder
But that's still the place I'm bound
Like a storm in search of thunder
I'm just a circus leaving town

Once we could fill a room with laughter
And fill each other's hearts with joy
Through each trial and disaster
'Til we'd cling to our choice

To take a path so unforgiving a road
That waits for no one
We know we chose to keep on living
Oh, tell me where did we go wrong?

Don't try and break this spell I'm under
Or stop these wheels from spinning round
For I'm a storm in search of thunder
Yeah, I'm a circus leaving town

Someday you'll wake up and wonder
And your heart will start to pound
And you'll long for the thunder
And the kisses of a clown

Philip Claypool,"Well, operator, operator, help me please
We get a war goin' on, we can't get no peace
We're either screamin' on the telephone yellin' in the yard
About a whole lotta nothin' and it's gone too far

So can you send out someone like they do on T-V
I'm talkin' 911, emergency
Send help quick, Lord, there ain't much time
Someone's wrecking this heart of mine

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No, she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

You should've heard the things she said
As she ripped the sheets right off of my bed
And I got a bad bad feeling that
We ain't seen the end of her yet

Well, officer, officer, it ain't no lie
I ain't good looking I'm a pretty nice guy
At church on Sunday and at work all week
Just tryin' to make a living for the lady and me

And though she may be pretty she's mean as a snake
I need protection for goodness sake
I've done taken as much as I can
I ain't Schwartzenegger, I'm only a man

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

She killed my lawn and all the trees
Ripped my big screen color TV
And now there ain't no tellin'
What next she'll be doing to me

Well, I don't understand how this trouble and strife
Can go hand in hand with the love of my life
But there ought to be a little price to pay
For treatin' a man and his dog that way

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No, she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

I still recall the words she said
As she ripped the sheets right off of my bed
Keep the lights on honey, 'cause you know
I'm coming back for the rest
Yeah, and I got a bad bad feeling that
We ain't seen the end of her yet",She Kicked My Dog
Philip Claypool,"You're like the night life of New York City, you keep me up so late
Seeing you sittin' next to me is like a drive across the Golden Gate
Your hair is like fields in autumn neath the brightenin' western sun
Beneath it's your way of loving that makes me come undone

It's your southern style, ah, nice and slow and easy
I'm deep in southern comfort from morning' through the evening
A little bit old fashioned and just a touch untame
It's your southern style that's got me feeling this way

If I could toss a silver dollar, oh, down a wishing well
I wish you'd take me for your man and be my belle
For I'd stand there beside you all through the thick and thin
I'd love you all life long, over and over again

I'm talking about southern style ?

I get a taste of honey, when you kiss me with your lips so soft and warm
It's heaven when you hold me all wrapped up in your angel arms

It's your southern style ?

Yeah, it's your southern style and I like your lovin' that way

Philip Claypool,"I remember the phone every evening
Ringing till it fell off the wall

Sprucing up to get on down
I thought we had same intention
But that ain't what I found

I'm just havin' a ball swingin' on my baby's chain

I remember that crowded bar room
We saw she was headin' our way
Just a lady in a room full of roosters
Crowing out their line of the day

She didn't hear a word they were saying
She just walked right into my life
She took me by the hand like she had it all planned
And we danced on into the night

Oh, weekend after weekend, day after day
Always together, two of a kind
Just dancing life's heartaches away

While my friends are growing old and lazy
You know I ain't feeling no pain
'Cause I'm just havin' a ball swingin' on my baby's chain
I'm just havin' a ball swingin' on my baby's chain

Come on, love's for those who make it

Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

What of a morning
That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently

Things of the heart
And lost love long ago",Morning

In einer doch so hellen Zeit
Warum du den wieder vermisst
Der dich sicher nicht befreit

Ja genau, das ist dein Leben
Ja das ist wie du lebst
Warum wir manchmal fliegen, nicht mal wissen wie es geht
Und wir immer wieder aufstehen und anfangen zu gehen
Ja genau, das ist dein Leben und du wirst es nie verstehen",Das ist dein Leben

Ziemlich gut, wie wir das so gemeistert haben
Wie wir die großen Tage unter kleinen Dingen begraben
Der Moment der die Wirklichkeit maskiert
Es tut nur gut zu wissen, dass das wirklich funktioniert

Lass uns die Wolke vier
Bitte nie mehr verlassen
Weil wir auf Wolke sieben

Was am Ende dann mein Leben
Und mein kleines Herz zerbombt
Denn der Moment ist das
Was es dann zeigt,
Dass die Tage ziemlich dunkel sind, doch dein Lächeln bleibt

Doch Dein Lächeln bleibt

A heavy rain a fallin'

The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Oben auf den Dünen kommt Alberto auf dem Fahrrad,
Mit Surfbrett und mit Jutetasche, fliegt er fast vom Rad,
Es gibt im Leben viele Zeiten, das hier sind die Guten,

Wir träumen und wir tauchen, bis die Sonne untergeht,

Und Salz auf der Haut
Und Wind in den Haaren

Ich komm zurück zum Strand und keiner hat's gesehen,
Wir düsen mit dem Motorboot raus zu den besten Stellen,
Mit Kescher und mit Netzen tauchen wir unter die Wellen,
Die Mädels sind zu Hause und decken schon den Tisch,
Wir kommen aus der Bucht zurück mit einem riesen Tintenfisch,
Festlich ist die Tafel, im Garten von Gettys,
Ich setz mich auf die Schaukel und schwing rein ins Paradies,

Wir geh'n mit Sand in den Schuhen
Und Salz auf der Haut
Und Wind in den Haaren
Nach Haus
Nach Haus

Treffen uns heut Abend mit ein paar Leuten bei den Klippen,
Wir bringen Holz für's Feuer mit, die andren Wein und Kippen,
Ich steh am Meer und schau hinaus, ich fühl' mich frei,
Und das beste ist, das Mädchen aus Paris ist auch dabei,

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Just that single perfect path, I haven't found it yet

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you

Phillip Mindenhall,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.","Some Enchanted Evening, song (from ""South Pacific"")"
Phillip Nelson,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?

Even a man on the moon couldn't tell me where to land
But, I wanted to fly in the sea with no gravity to pull me down

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't run to me when you fall
'Cause the steps getting bigger so we here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly, waste away
Uh oh, no no

So tell me this one thing
Now listen to me close
You steal from me but you call it your own
You liar you thieve go make your stand on your own two feet
So oh now, oh now, listen what your friends say
Go now go now go and do it that'a way
I'm the one you want to believe
But in your heart you can't see

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't run to me when you fall
'Cause the steps getting bigger so we here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly, waste away

Oh, let it fall, let it fall

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't run to me when you fall
'Cause the steps getting bigger so we here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly, waste away",Man on the Moon
Phillip Phillips,"Like a folly from a tall tree landing on the grass
Like the white sand turns the clock in any hour glass
You're the reason, I believe in something, I don't know

You make it so, you make it so, you make it so easy
This letting go, is so beautiful, 'cause you make it so easy,
To fall so hard, to fall so hard

Like the ocean pulls the tide and just to hold me close
Like a rainbow in a rainstorm makes the flowers grow
You're the reason, I believe in, something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so, you make it so easy
This letting go, is so beautiful, 'cause you make it so easy,

Phillip Phillips,"Tell you a story and it starts with time
Moves to how you live and learn how to die
Another phase in this world that brings deaths to life
So don't believe in everything you see
Because what you want might not be what you need
Hold your breath jump with me and we'll survive
'Cause you are the sun, that leads me to the light

Hope is just a ray of what everyone should see
Alone is the street where you found me
Scared of what's behind and scared of what's in front
Live with what you have now and make the best of what's to come

Tell me a story long and true
We aren't what we say we are what we do
Just pieces of a puzzle to find, where we stand
Just confused so you are the moon, that pulls me through the night

Hope is just a ray of what everyone should see
Alone is the street where you found me
Scared of what's behind and scared of what's in front
Live with what you have now and make the best of what's to come
Live with what you have now and make the best of what's to come

Hope is just a ray of what everyone should see
Alone is the street where you found me
Scared of what's behind and scared of what's in front
Live with what you have now and make the best of what's to come

So you are the sun that leads me
You are the moon that pulls me
You are the light that leads me
You are the moon that pulls me",Tell Me a Story
Phillip Phillips,"Lonely in a room, no sound to fill your soul
Hopes and dreams are held so close you can't let go
But you can only see when I look into your eyes
You pulled me in too deep

Take me in, take me out till I'm nothing more
Than words spoken from your sweet, sweet mouth
Dance around like no one can see baby
Move your body with the rhythm
Move your body next to me

Wanted is love
Now go insane
You know you've got to hold onto what you love
Before it's gone away

Wanted is love
Now go insane
You know you've got to hold onto what you love
Before it's gone away

One step to you and I'm sinking in your lies
Only to see the truth hidden behind your evil eyes
And no light could lead me to the way of you
Is it me or am I alone?
It's all such mystery

Wanted is love
Now go insane
You know you've got to hold onto what you love
Before it's gone away

No, I don't wanna fall in love

As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you’re not alone
'Cause I’m going to make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear

They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry, no one will care girl

Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don' you stay?
Deep in my soul,
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away

I've longed for love, like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching, even after today
So there it is girl, I've said it all now

And here we are babe, what do you say?
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?

'Cause the words we said in anger still echo in my brain
Alone through the darkness in this cave
I wanna hear you whisper
Hang on every word you say

Climb the mountain, swim for shore
Bring it back to how it was before

Take it out, blow it up
Ignite the memory in between us
Through the storm and all the dust
Take it out of these walls with a cannonball
But don’t let it go, don’t give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from

I connect the stars to build a map to you
In the empty space we’re dreaming
Will we still know the truth

Climb the mountain, swim for shore
Bring it back to how it was before

Take it out, blow it up
Ignite the memory in between us
Through the storm and all the dust
Take it out of these walls with a cannonball
But don’t let it go, don’t give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from

Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh, ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh

Behind the light I flicker
My shadow starts to bend
Into the night like a whisper

Because of you
It's never the same
Because of you
The darkness fades

Higher and higher
Like a flame on fire
I feel alive again
Desire, desire
Burning brighter and brighter
I feel alive again
I feel alive again

Throw out what makes me thin
But the harder I try, it lingers
You see it through the rain
On the other side it shimmers

Because of you

With your head hanging low
Seemed all the world was weighing you down
Like a heavy stone
Finding out that it's hard not to fall when you stumble
Here it goes again

Pull me out and push again
You never noticed when it all began
Let me go and reel me in
But it's too late now, I'm just an armless crawler
It's too late now, I'm just an armless crawler

I saw it there again
The shadow through the window
Seems to follow me around
Like I've nowhere to go
Knowing now that we can not change the future

What just happened, it seems
Like clouds of rain just poured out on me
The light was much further I could see
But it's too late now I'm gonna make it through these clouds

Clouds hide behind what can't be seen
Just the darkness holds us up, you and me
The dice keeps rolling it never stops on what I need
So I'll change the game, let's see where that takes me

You've gotta live to know who you are

I wanna be the one you run to
When your dreams won't leave you alone
Out in this night you run to your head
But your head won't even hold you
On top of this world, in this life you think you've got it all
Then you look up at the stars
And realize where you are
So dream boy, dream boy
And see where you find yourself in this life

You've gotta live to know who you are

Tell me I'm wrong
Beg me please
I've gotta find out if it's really me
Who I believe
So when I say I'm okay
Don't trust me

I wanna stand on top of the mountain
Shine more than the sun brings out
To each of us each is a key we hold
So why don't we unlock the treasures that we long for
Every fall you catch, every thought you forget
Don't let it slip through your hands to let the next one catch
Everything that was coming your way
Don't let it all start to slowly step away

You've gotta live to know who you are

Why don't you open up and let me in?

Give you a reason to stay, give you a reason to not

'Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door

I found what you need
Come on and give me what I want, a taste of you with me
The further I go, the closer you seem
Why won't you leave me alone, why won't you leave me be?

How should I give up, how should I survive?
Leaning to the side of the busy street
Looking down, these people never notice me
Am I the only one who thinks it's hard to breathe?

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over
It's only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

Ten thousand faces here, but who am I?
Am I the only one with a reason to hide?
Searching through a maze only to find
Another wall to break, another wall to climb
It's when I lose myself, then I realize

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over

That I'm just a fool for

And I'm twisted in a dream
In between who I am

This heavy heart of stone
I feel it break like glass

Shine the light then turn it out

You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used

And I'll follow wherever you go
Right down that rabbit hole
Then everything gets dark

With every word I breathe
I see the way you've changed me

Around then throw me down

Once could dream
We’re bigger than we seem

So softly they fell
I reached to you to wipe them off your chin
But you stopped me and said

""Please just leave me be

Where the river meets the sea
White crosses without number
Line the fields of peace

And each one a silent witness
Staring back at me
Every cross a story
Of another place in time

Where young men thought it worthy
To give their life for mine
And for the sake of honor
Left their dreams behind

And for the price they paid
I'm forever in their debt
Their memory will not die
'Cause I will not forget

I will stand and hold my head up high
I will dedicate my life
To the glory of the
Ones who had to die

I will live, live what I believe
If for no one else but me
I will remember
That freedom's never free

It was on another hillside
Outside the city gates
The battle lines were drawn
As soldiers took their place

The Father watched in silence
As a cross was raised
With freedom drawing closer

He took His final breath
He drank our cup of guilt
And took the sting from death

Heaven's Finest Soldier
Clothed in human flesh
And for the price He paid

I'm forever in His debt
The cross will never die
'Cause I will not forget

I will stand and hold my head up high
I will dedicate my life

But I won't go back again
See, once I tasted freedom
Then the walls could bind no more
Since mercy gave me wings to fly
Like an eagle I can sore
[Repeat chorus]
Somewhere there's a prison
Where the chains still burn
If not for the grace of god
Those walls could still be mine
So far all the captives are saved

"Phillips, Craig & Dean","Earn your way, that's the lesson that we're taught
But I know things eternal can't be sold and can't be bought
Amazing grace is something I could never hold
And I know love and mercy are outside of my control

But I'm reminded of a ransom, paid beyond my worth
On a hill outside the city, where heaven kissed the earth

Because of that blood, because of that dream
Because of that mercy pouring over me
Because of that grace I've been set free
Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed

Some believe that they can make it on their own
But only in the end to find they're really not that strong
But I believe that if I choose to live by faith
That God will give me strength to make it each and every day

For we are lost without a Savior, to save us from ourselves
For it's only by the grace of God that we can live to tell, hey

Because of that blood, because of that dream
Because of that mercy pouring over me
Because of that grace I've been set free
Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed

Who of us can say that we are worthy of the blood of Jesus Christ
All that we can do is simply offer Him our own by laying down our lives

Because of that blood, because of that dream
Because of that mercy pouring over me
Because of that grace I've been set free

You wouldn't bare the silence anymore
Love broke the fall, bridged across to reach us
You opened Heaven's door
'Cause You couldn't stand the distance

Close enough to see the love I needed
A seeker looking for the way back home
Underneath the weight of what I wasted
While mercy stood looking down on hope

Then You ran to where I was waiting
And Your love crossed the canyon between us
You came to save me

mad 'cause I oversee the Projects like A&R's

while you cooked Four and a half and got a quarter back 
you play the tough guy role good, I ought to  clap

I graduated from Eight balls to blow that's cake size

while my fam rocks links and medallions that's plate size 
you up against The Clipse, believe there's no chance
what you feel about hollows piercin' through your throat glands?
see, I sweet talk the Devil, take him on a slow dance 
while your hardcore posse's is extras and road hands

I want the one who cook it up and make you push the pack

I never been the one to talk and chill shit out
I shoot 'till it jam and the clip don't spit out

two ways to live, cocaine or showbiz 
knee deep in crime rhyme, in coke? my shoulders

"Phineas Newborn, Jr.","Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home (x2)

Phish,"In the cool shade of the banana tree
On the rugged trail toward the balcony
A child of the twentieth century
A dried up Goliath and a weasel named Fee

Far away in another place
A fading beauty named Milly Grace
And a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace

Fee was a Buddhist prodigy
Long past the age of maturity
Someday he knew it would set him free
Like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free.
You're racing with the wind
You're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee
And catch your breath

Fee first met Milly in a bar in Peru
His heart was jumping like a kangaroo
Like a beast in a cage in an old Dutch zoo
It was hopping and thumping in wooden shoes

But Floyd was jealous and alone
He wanted Milly for his own
A desperate craving in his bones
""Their love"", he said, ""I will not condone.""

Then one day on a ship to Quebec
Floyd found Milly on a lover's trek
He picked up a bottle and broke off the neck
It sliced through the air, and Fee hit the deck

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
You want to stay with Milly
Until you're dead
But you just got a bottle
Upside your head

Milly turned and began to scream at Floyd
said ""You think you're pretty mean""
And though she was as thin as a small string bean
She slammed him in the face with a nectarine

Floyd fell back over the edge of the ship
Till he hung from the rail by his fingertip
said, ""Floyd I'll make you lose your grip
With this tiny piece of paper I can make you slip""

So Milly took that paper and did the deed
Floyd hit the water with astonishing speed
And as the sharks circled and began to feed
Milly knew her weasel was finally free

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
Floyd is dead; he's nothing but a ripple
Cause Milly took that paper
And sliced him on the nipple",Fee

Please wipe it from your shoes

Scourged the evening with his cry
And sanctuary bugs deprived

Before I could blink twice

I gave some last advice:

The flesh from Satan's dogs
Will make the rudiments of gruel

Deduct the carrots from your pay
You worthless swampy fool

Exploding then through fields and fen
And swimming in the mire

Demented me with fire
I drifted where the current chose
Afloat upon my back
And if perchance a newt slimed by
I'd stuff it in my sack

Soon I felt a bubble form, Somewhere below my skin
But with handy spine of hedgehog
I removed the force within
Suzie then removed her mask
And caused a mighty stir
The angry mob responded
Taking turns at grabbing her

The foggy cavern's musty grime
Appeared within my palm
I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off
With deadly icy calm

The brothel wife then grabbed a knife
And slashed me on the tongue
I turned the blade back on the bitch
And dropped her in the dung]

The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue
And used her like a rag
To mop the slime from where the slug
Had slithered with the bag

In summing up, the moral seems
A little bit obscure...

A mudrat detector, a ribbon reflector
A cushion convector, a picture of nectar 
A virile dissector,a hormone collector

See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders

South to the west to the east to the north

Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezy

Never see Will attackin' 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and um,

In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane

She was living in a lonely cabin with a son by another man
Five years she had waited for him as long as a woman can
As long as a woman can

I don't know what changed my mind
'Til then I was the rambling kind
The kind of love I can't explain
That I had for Nellie Kane

She hired me on to work that day to help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands
In the evening we held hands

Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know
It was then I realized that I would never go   
That I would never go

To endure in the shadow of Wilson's castle

Once upon a time Far far away from here 
There, in a small town...
A small town...

And on the outskirts of this town 
There lived a mean, nasty, furry, ugly hound named Harpua. 

Harpua roamed the outskirts of the town every day and he'd walk around looking for a little action. 
So of course this day was no different from any other day and here we start the story and we see Harpua walking around on the outskirts of town near the forest kind of at the edge of the forest and he's walking in toward town...
Harpua walked toward the town...
Innocently...
And meanwhile in the town...
In a whole different part of the town 
There lived a young boy all alone in a suburban neighborhood 
And every day he'd sit in his room 
And sit on his little couch [AND SMOKE POT!]... 

he'd sit on his little couch and 
He'd listen to his stereo...
And he'd lay back and 
He'd look down next to him and 
He'd pet his favorite little [DOG!] 
Furry little...
Oh, he loved his little...
Furry...
Thing that he pet every day while he listened to his stereo 
[while sitting on the couch] 
He'd pet his furry [thing on the couch] his furry...
And he looked down and he said 
""I love to pet you, my little furry...
Thing that I ... 
I love you so much that I decided to name you 
This name that I love and so I named you...
I love you so... 

that's why...
That's why I pet you every day...
That's why I named you...
That's why when I first got you and 
I knew how much I loved you...

I decided that I'd give you the name of... 
The moniker of...
I'd call you...

Poster Nutbag, the furry little kitty-cat Jimmy's pet sat next to Jimmy and he looked up at Jimmy...
And on this particular day Poster Nutbag decided to go for a little walk so Poster Nutbag got up and walked toward the door and Jimmy went to the door and he opened up the door and Poster Nutbag went outside and he started walking across the yard.. 
And he walk onto the sidewalk and he started walking innocently down the street and he walked down the street and suddenly he found himself wandering... 
Into a new part of town that he'd never been to...

Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN

And when he got there he was walking along and suddenly he rounded a corner and in front of him he saw...
He saw Harpua...
Harpua, the ugly dog from the beginning of the story...
And they looked at each other...
Tension filled the air... 
There was going to be a nasty fight...

Harpua saw Poster Nutbag and began to growl and let a hungry drop of saliva fall onto the floor... 
Poster Nutbag coiled his body into a deadly arch... 
The fight was about to begin...

From you loving cup
A just one drink
And I'll fall down drunk

I feel so humble
With you tonight
Just sitting
In front of the fire

I see your face dancing in the flame
Feel your mouth kissing me again
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz

Come with that
Oh, what a beautiful buzz
What a beautiful buzz

Yes, I am nitty gritty
And my shirt's all torn
But I would love to spill the beans
With you till dawn

And give me little drink
From your loving cup
A just one drink
And I'll fall down drunk

Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink

Phish,"Hey, hey, hey, hey
Come from the North where the oceans freeze
Spent three long months at the open seas
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more
Till I hit the ground on Prussia's shores

How was I to know that day
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way
But soon towards me from the East
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beast

Hey!

Well, it seemed he didn't like my face
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip

Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed

Singing, ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye""

Hey!

Now Wilson knew that I was loose
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree
So angrily I paddled to the open sea

But the sea was eager to beat me back
And the waves grew huge and deadly black
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead

When the morning came and the storm had passed
The dismal fog began at last
To open up before my eyes
And there I saw to my surprise

Chains and specks of islands curved
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved
Parked my kayak on a stone
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne

I said, ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye
Wilson, kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye""

Once upon a time there was a mountain that rose out of a vast green forest. And in the forest there were birds and lakes and rocks and trees and rivers. The forest was also inhabited by a small group of people called the lizards. The lizards were a simple people and they had lived in the forest undisturbed for thousands of years in utter peace and tranquillity. Once a year when spring came, and the first blossoms began to show, the

lizards would gather at the base of the mountain, to give thanks for all that they had. They thanked the birds and they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks and the trees and the rivers; but most importantly, they thanked Icculus. 

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain, or at least everyone thought so, for no one had actually ever seen him. But they knew he existed, because they had the Helping Friendly Book. Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book to the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift. It contained all of the knowledge inherent in the universe, and had

enabled the Lizards to exist in harmony with nature for years. And so they lived; until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge. His name was Wilson and he quickly became intrigued by the Lizards way of life. He asked if he could stay on and live in the forest; and the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider, were happy to oblige.

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years, studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book, and all was well. Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone. Wilson explained that he had hidden the book, knowing that the Lizards had become dependent on it for survival. He declared himself king and enslaved the innocent

people of Gamehendge. He cut down the trees and built a city, which he called Prussia. And in the center of the city he built a castle, and locked in the highest tower of the castle lay the Helping Friendly Book out of the reach of the Lizards forever. But our story begins at a different time, not in Gamehendge, but on a suburban street in Long Island, and our hero is no king sitting in a castle, he is a retired colonel shaving in his bathroom.


Colonel Forbin looked square in the mirror and dragged the blade across his cold creamed skin. He saw the tired little folds of flesh that lay in a heap beneath his eyes. Fifty-two years of obedient self-restraint, of hiding his tension behind a serene veil of composure. For fifty-two years he had piled it all on the back burner, and for fifty-two years it had boiled, frothing over in a turbulent storm inside of him. It had escaped through his eyes, reacting with the cigarette smoke and the fluorescent lights and slowly accumulating into a sagging mass. He ran his dripping palm across the stubble on the nape of his neck and thought again about the door. He had discovered the door some months back on one of his ritualistic morning walks with his dog McGrupp. It had started out as a typical stroll with McGrupp bounding joyously ahead of the preoccupied colonel. As they reached the apex of the hill, he saw it and he knew it had always been there, and felt foolish for overlooking the door for so long. At first, he tried to ignore it, but he soon found that it was impossible, and slowly his newly acquired knowledge transformed his dreary life into a prison from which there was only one escape. And on this morning, Colonel Forbin stepped through the door...

Then reveling in mirror mask I soon was lost in foggy ditch,

Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch,

Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze,

My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways,

I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs,

The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam,

The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream,

And wiped away the beads of sweat

That glistened on his brow

His tired feet were buried in the quagmire

And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him

And fulfillment of his vow


And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root

And pulled his body upwards

To a sea green mossy boulder

And he dragged his weary carcass [or ""shit-ass""] up the mountain


And he climbed so slowly

He climbed so slowly

Ahead

Ahead


Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder

And the rocks began to crumble overhead

And tumble down the mountain to the

Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs

through which his path had led

And the earth began to quake beneath his feet

And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes

And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones

Cascading down the mountain

And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...


The sacred creed will be yours

And if you wait until tomorrow

The sacred creed will be yours

To devour

Yours

To seize

And to obey

Obey


When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head

And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light

And he saw the silhouette that stood before him

And he bowed in reverence

Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form

Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes

Looking down on Colonel Forbin

Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck

And he quietly addressed him


And he spoke so slowly

He spoke so slowly

Ahead

He said


Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here

And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack

I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird

To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack

And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow

And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed

But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure

Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice

And greed


The sacred greed will be yours

And if you wait until tomorrow

The sacred creed will be yours

To devour

Yours

To seize

And to obey

And to obey




And the famous mockingbird swooped down out of the sky and landed on

Icculus's shoulder, and Icculus whispered into the bird's ear, and it flew

off toward Wilson's castle in the valley below.

The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for him. With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a King.

The stars though she seemed to respect

The faint light that flutters at night to the
earth
Would land in her eyes and collect
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf

Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone I am inclined
If I find a pebble in sand
To think that it fell from my hand

She gave me ideas
Planted the seed
But she never stopped to reflect
The course that she's on, wherever it leads
I never would redirect

Make us hold tight but are lost in the end

WRITER BOB DYLAN

Well, I ride on a mail train, baby,
Can't buy a thrill.
Well, I've been up all night, baby, Leanin' on the window sill.
Well, if I die On top of the hill
And if I don't make it, You know my baby will.
Don't the moon look good, mama,
Shinin' through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama,
Flagging down the ""Double E""?
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?
Now the wintertime is coming,
The windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody,
But I could not get across.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you
When your train gets lost.

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

My benediction, my conviction, my electric chair
My reaction, attraction
You expose my every layer

You're my poem on a cloudy day
Alabaster shores with palms that sway
A fleeting glance misread
And then I run away

You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar
Oh, my love, how beautiful
How beautiful we are, we are

You're my morning star, my wake up call
You are my trip, you are my fall, my fall

You are sacred ancient music
For the devil to deploy
Prying loose the dead bolt
To my heart's forgotten door

You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar

Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes

Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes, old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor

Belongs now to the baby down the hall

Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again
I can feel it

This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris presents the circle
And puts the glory out to hide

Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me

I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that' s fading away

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost

They were made of dust, after all

As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how

I need a cool day riding
Feeding all the horses at dawn
Searching for the truffles, going through the woods
Then I'll be waiting

I've passed all summer days driving

No more take-away's, expired food
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food

When will they come back home?
Will they be the same?
These are the things that I think about

I never called on you before
There's one thing I got to know

Sometimes took this life for granted
Never called you by your name
Always tried to live right by you
Could I be the one to blame?

Of all the things you could take from me
That's just too much pain to bear
Trading on my life's ambitions
Grant me please, this one last prayer

Begging, please God give him shelter
When the rain begins to fall
Shine your light on him for guidance
When his back's against the wall

I will feel the fire burning
See, I'm in the darkest night
Almost taste the air he's breathing
Hear the whispers of his thoughts

Never had time for religions
Always made my own decisions
Never cared for reasons why
[Incomprehensible] my means I justify

[Incomprehensible] can't stop waiting
Come and stop this pain I'm hating
Never thought this time would come
Things were left unsaid and done

I just wanna be with you
My heart won't beat again
If our eyes can't meet again
This just can't be the end

I just wanna be with you
My heart won't beat again
If our eyes can't meet again
This just can't be the end

I don't need your news debriefing
They don't give me no relieving
I don't need your love reports
Nothing is fair in love and war

Making drama out of crisis
Human lives have market prices
Should I care what's right or wrong?
If he never comes back home

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you

And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""

Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?

""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, stopped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""

Phunk Junkeez,"Just a minute ladies and gentlemen I think something is happening 
The planet earth is the third outermost planet of nine planets orbiting the single sun

A long time ago in a far away galaxy 
Alien dope fiends ran out of their weed
They built a ship with a cannabis radar 
And before they left they pulled troops with Darth Vader 
Who told them of a planet where the dank shit grows 
And hydroponics is a science that everyone knows 
So they set out on a mission to a planet called earth
On a never ending quest to get their herb

They're on a never ending quest to get high 
They're on a never ending quest to get high 
It's a weed war and somebody's gonna die

Abductees on TV told me in secrecy 
About a government conspiracy 
To snatch all of our crops to keep the cops paid 
Pot for technology the deal has been made 
And uncle Sam is behind the scam
He's slinging sacks behind our backs
Raising the tax to the max 
I hear he's getting stoned with the sleep stacks
Renegade pot smokers get united 
UFO's and earth feelers have been sighted 
So people don't trip and cause mass hysteria 
There's a skunky phunky smell in the Roswell 
Area 51 ships have landed they've been commanded
To take the herbs that we have planted 
You know they didn't count on a counter attack 
And I never leave home without a fat sack
So I grab my nine gram bag of kind 
A lighter and some papers it was all I could find 
Ran to headquarters grabbed a big ol'glass 
With the intentions of smoking some alien grass

We're on a never ending quest to get high
A never ending quest to get high 
We're on a never ending quest to get high 
Circles in my crop that shit got to stop 

We're on a never ending quest to get high
A never ending quest to get high 
We're on a never ending quest to get high 
Circles in my crop that shit got to stop 

So we pulled up to the gates of the alien camp 
We come all alone with some home grown hemp 
Fighting for the right of mans kind 
We can out smoke you earthlings anytime 
Shoot you wanna battle 
Let's get it on me and you one on one bong for bong 
I said hey great I hope your vegetarian 
Cause botashous dank is what I'm carrying 
He replied hmmm this shits all right 
And he broke out with some space phlavored kryptonite 
So I broke off a chunk of that cosmic phunk 
And I shattered the glass like a Shaq fu dunk 
It's my turn so I reached in my sack 
To pack a fat bowl to make this brain react 
Pulled a switch with some ditch dirt weed sticks oregano and some bird seed 
He started choking smoke was shooting out his gills 
When he drank the bong water oh he gave me chills
I mean he fell on the ground and started throwing up 
His eyes went cross eyed his head was blowing up 
His brain exploded this shit was fried
That was the last of the never ending quest to get high

Were on a never ending quest to get high
It's a weed war and the aliens just died",The Quest

We get so close

We're far away

Is honesty

It takes two
For a relationship to be
Everything we need
To feel complete

It takes two
For love to make it through the hardest time
We'll go through
It takes two

Have some faith
In what we feel
In time our love
Will be revealed

Open up
That cautious heart
And let me in
So we can start

Phyllis Hyman,"Someone to love
Someday I?ll finally find the man I dreamed about
He?ll be the love that touched my heart and turned my feelings inside out
It's been so long and I grow tired of being all alone

Am I asking for too much?
All I want is someone I can touch
Why must it take so long to find someone to love?

I tried to lose myself and fool myself
Hide myself in someone?s arms
I tried to make believe I had it all
But deep inside I always knew
That lovers who pretend lose out in the end

No matter how long it may take
I know the difference and I?ll wait for someone to love

Ooh, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love
Whose beauty lies within their sensitivity
I?ll walk with hope and I?ll hold on
Until the day shall come along

Am I asking for too much?
All I want is love that I can touch
Why must it take so long to find ooh, someone to love?

Or the corn in Carolina

Phyllis Newman,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills
Phyllis Taylor Sparks,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song

If you believe in me

It's a honky tonk parade

To touch their harps of gold

Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

[Chorus]
 
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

Pia Zadora,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows
Pia Zadora,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Pia Zadora,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day

Pia Zadora,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle

And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

Piano Red,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye
Piano Red,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire
Piano Strings Ensemble,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Pibes Chorros,"Entre rejas y alejado de su gente
El preso está con un lápiz y un pedazo de papel
Escribiéndole a su madre que está triste
Que lamenta y se maldice por haberla hecho llorar

Entre rejas y alejado de su gente

Escribiéndole a su madre que está triste
Que lamenta y se maldice por haberla hecho llorar

Hace meses que ya no recibe cartas de mama

Que su madre ya está muerta que murió de soledad

Y entre rejas se dio cuenta que perdió
Lo que más quería y le hace falta valor
Para seguir su vida
Y entre rejas se dio cuenta que hoy está

Picaso,"I can't cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy

And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know
I'll take my share of chances
Ain't no use of holding on
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I've seen my life
Through someone else's eyes

And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding on
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side

Because it's my turn
It's my turn

It's my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done

But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's gonna say
At least I didn't try

Funny, but when you're near me

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring.

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain
