Ladyhawke,"Sick of all that we have to be in this life
Gimme all that you have, gimme what you like
Waiting here for a fool to begin his life
And you, you try to remember
Flipping coins from a tin till he feels the night
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world

Gimme time to reflect, gimme all we know
Holding hands on the street where the lights are low
You and me wanting more but we'll never know
And you, you try to remember
What it means in a world where it's never slow
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world

Gimme all that you have, gimme what you like
Waiting here for a fool to begin his life
And you, you try to remember
Flipping coins from a tin till he feels the night
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a, a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a

Ladyhawke,"When you hide next to me
With your eyes up close to me
I hear footsteps in the dark
When you hijack my heart

Cool breeze down the hall
I can feel you breathe outside my door

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn

When you sense you're not alone
And the darkness starts to moan who's there?

Shadows all around
But you don't make a sound
Voices in my head
Playing like an echo, echo

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do",Dusk Till Dawn
Ladyhawke,"Love, love, love don't live here anymore
You say that it's a shame and show me the door
You say that you don't need me anymore
And I said

Love, love, love don't live here any
Love, love all you want is ending
Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Lonely hearts are always wanting more
But only parts of mine were still unsure
You say that you don't want me anymore
And I say

Love, love, love don't live here any
Love, love all you want is ending
Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Don't know anymore

Love, love, love is always so unsure
But bleeding hearts have always known no law
You say that you don't need me anymore
And I said

Love, love all the nights we're spending
Love, love, love don't live here anymore

Don't know anymore

You say your life was heading downhill
The light denied you, that's why you left
From me, what's left to you
I waited for you still

You say your life was heading downhill
The light denied you, that's why you left
From me, what's left to you
I waited for you still",Love Don't Live Here
Ladyhawke,"You came to my show
And I saw you in the crowd
I didn't know your name
I didn't know your name

I asked all my friends who you were
And your story
They told me the same
They told me the same

I left my heart to you but it's not fair
'Cause you're taking me for granted, baby
I made a stone with you but it's not fair
'Cause you're over me and land it, baby

One journey for you but it's worth it
One life and with me and it's magic
One journey for you but it's worth it
One life and with me and it's magic

You stayed at my head
While I saw you all the time
I didn't think you care
I didn't think you care

I fought you all day
With a mouth full of attitude
You stole my away
You stole my away

I left my heart to you but it's not fair
'Cause you're taking me for granted, baby
I made a stone with you but it's not fair
'Cause you're over me and land it, baby

One journey for you but it's worth it

Ladyhawke,"You're a women without a clue, you're a friend of no ones too
Keeping track of your lies must be hard for someone new
So better not try to get inside my head, you'll find a nightmare waiting

You make it worse, leave it to the ones who know me
Playing that game will only hurt you, you make it worse and never better

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain

I'm a girl who sees a fraud, I'm suspicious and keeping notes
Watching you go through my friends, waiting here to make my move so
Give an inch you'll take a mile, pulling me down to push yourself up
You make it worse and never better

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain
Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain

You're so completely twisted, you're so completely evil
You're so completely wrong but here I am still stuck with you

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain
Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up

Ladyhawke,"When I get you home I'll never let you go
Too bad never last for long
When I'm on alone you creep into my mind
And I pretend it's you by my side

You're looking all better each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Everything that I wanted in you
And do everything that I need you to do

Morning dreams come true
'Cause I wake up next to you
Only for your eyes

Everything you do is all I need to know
I'm yours and never let you down
Everywhere you are is where I wanna be
Anywhere, anytime or place

Ladyhawke,"Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium

At the end of the day they all sit together around the fire
They have their supper and relax and talk a little

Cheetahs, wolves jackals and lions
He starts crying at the darkness
And wild sounds that fill him with fear

Then his mother takes him in her arms
And sings to him

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night

We all start in the streams

Sometimes you have to let go when there's
Next to nothing
You say every time she says no
There's more pain then love
It comes o shove almost
Every time you speak
Somehow you fight
Something's just crazy
Somehow it's taking all the life left in you
You're losing ground
Carrying that torch
Your not asking for much
As she has
Had time to heal
And she doesn't need you any longer an you
Had time to drink
And you call her to tell her you've gotten much stronger
At three in the morning she says stop calling 'cause
Everyone's asleep
Some of us work
You're driving me crazy
When will you get on with my life
Now every nights Friday night
Picking fights with your friends
Somehow trying to make amends
So you search for comfort in a friend
It's not the same she won't understand
You both learned to think alike
So what was so wrong
Where's she tonight
Out there drinking while you're left in thinking
It's taken all the life left in
You
You're losing ground

Laibach,"Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long long year
Stole many a man's soul, and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ
had his moment of doubt and pain
And I made damn sure that Pilate
washed his hands, and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
I stuck around St. Petersburg,
when I saw it was time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a General's rank
When the Blitzkreig raged,
and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
fought for ten decades, for the God they made
Shouted out ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all... it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
Just as every cop is a criminal
and all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint!
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politics
Or I'll lay your soul to waste",Sympathy for the Devil [Time for a Change]

War has caused unrest among the younger generation

Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody
Who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard
This time around for me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If your looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say oh I
You've got to show me love

Show me show me baby
You've got to give it to me give it to me give it to me yeah

Forty-four robbers around my door
Forty-four - and maybe more

Stubbly faces & gap-tooth grins
Ain`t no way I`m lettin` them in

No way - you can`t come in
Forty-four robbers stinkin` of gin
Uh huh - I ain`t lettin` you in
I`ll hit you with a rolling pin
So small can`t hurt a fly
Get in my way and I`ll sure as hell try
To kick your butt down the block
Can`t wait yellin` for the cops

Fifty dealers and fifty thieves
Starring at the drive-in on my street
Shit, over my shoulder there`s Popeye and Bluto
Looking nasty - can I remember my judo?
It`s always like this - going out alone
So damn scared might never leave home

I`ve got my freedom I`ve got my pride
All means nothin` with these men outside
Puffing and preening and strutting their stuff
Blocking my way out - I`ve had enough!
Give me justice - hand it over now
Gotta get a gun or maybe just leave town...

See ya!
Sly Stallone and Al Capone
Are giving me grief on the telephone
All I want is a Swiss cheese sarnie
When at the deli stands big Arnie
Hey Jean-Claude - move aside
That taxi`s mine - I`m taking that ride
When I go out to get the Sunday paper
What`s my man to think `someone might rape her`?!
I`m just having a beer on my own
Don`t mean Hulk Hogan can take me home
I`ve got my mace but my loud-as-fuck whistle
Is so ineffective I just pray the Epistles
For help to come someday soon
But until then I`ll stay in my room",44 Robbers
Laika,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Laika,"I'm sitting here
Alone
I'm pitching a tent like a camper's home
All I've got tonight, are dirty feet and giggles
And Rover, and this jar of Jif
And I grab a butter knife
To end my virginal strife
I've tried hard hard hard
To get between you and him
But in the end of you, I begin
I take a deep breath that is dreamy
And smear on some extra creamy
And I call the canine over
To try out my new lollipop boner
When senor skippy is in town
All I think about
Is my dog going down

And this is why I used vaginal cream
That time when I tried out for swim team
I had to shave my legs and my balls
But no knowledge of the bathroom, I did it in the hall
I shit myself at the family reunion
And that time I first received my holy communion
The moon is rising
And these extra two inches tonight are surprising
And I
And you
And ro-o-over too

Can't believe
What your new crush just did to my shoe
There is feces all inside
And it's covering the fresh leather hide
Do you remember what tonight is
The night Elvis dies while taking a piss
And it was on the television
And my sperm is now spraying like nuclear fission
And now I need Kleenex Cottonelle
Cause this sticky feeling is comparable with hell
And I'm sick of low fat lays
And they more I hate it, the more my gizz sprays
And now windex is required
For now my ejaculate has retired
To window overlooking the tree house
And I must clean it up as quiet as a mouse
But alas I make an utterance
It is my mom, a goddamn stutterance
She has caught me, red handed

Tissue on dick
With that creamy Jif
All over my stick
And it's not even a maternal figure
It's you and you're dressed like a wigger
I hate fat Albert Jeans
Can someone holla for me if they know what I mean
Alas, I recover my .38
It is the only way to go out after you masturbate.

If it wasn't for your indecision

Anticipate your every move
Purposely find contradiction
Escalate nothing to prove

All poking fun at a smile

He knew damn well what lies were for

Life robs you of your bones an' slips by in dreams
And absolutely nothing is as it seems
That halfway point between life and death
Slipped by and now I've less time left

I just got used to always bein' wrong
I know one thing one thing I know
That sweet sweet man's just gotta go

I can see the mountains
Melt the sky into the sea
The birds that fly the trackless air
The creatures in the deep
Where the light just hits the water
Where the earth meets sky
I shall scatter your desire
And mix snow and fire

My heart beats wings my steps are streams
(my heartbeat swings my steps are strings)

Saw kingdoms crushed and crumbled
Saw the earth from the rim of a ship
Heard the whistle of the damnation train
But I didn't see her coming

Baby clear sky light
That lyin' goat borrowed my heart
And now it's broke
With big guns booming like thunder
I should have struck him cemetery dead

41 dollars and 63 cents won't buy my way out of this mess
41 dollars and 63 cents won't get me a dress to compete with her best
God made woman when he took out a bone
Gave it to adam so he wasn't alone
Fell at his feet - a heap on the floor
Now he ain't coming back no more

I saw him on the lake at Galilee
The ship was gliding away from me
Sails unfurled in the evening breeze
The white caps marbleized into peaks
The wind is a woman and the water is too
The moon he holds the reins of the tides
With big guns booming like thunder
I should have struck him cemetery dead

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Laila Dalseth,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

That this heart of mine embraces all day through

The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

Would obey, say
If you were mine

Aber abends werd' ich wach.
Morgens bin ich so solide,
Doch am Abend werd' ich schwach.

Wenn der Wecker morgens rasselt,
Und der Tag nimmt seinen Lauf.
Ist die Stimmung mir vermasselt,
Denn ich steh so ungern auf.

Doch wenn Tausend Lichter glühen,
Bin ich jede Nacht ganz groß.
Und wenn dann noch Musik erklingt, huh,
Dann geht es los!

Ich bin Morgens immer müde,
Aber abends werd' ich wach.
Morgens bin ich so solide,
Doch am Abend werd' ich schwach.

So schwach

In der Bar zum flotten Benne,
Bin ich außer Rand und Band.
Um mich tanzen 14 Männer,
Ohne Mühe an die Wand.
Cha Cha swing und boogie woogie,
Tanz ich ohne unterlass'.

Die ist ja krass.

For being so untrue

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

And they whirl you across the floor

Living in a world of make-believe

With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
Except a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself

Lair of the Minotaur,"Zeus walks the Earth as man,
To relate evil deeds,
Frightful with hiding beasts,
Lycaon tests deity,

Throne of the hostile king,
A shadowed offering,
Knife slits the servant child,
Served as a dish of flesh,

Avenging thunderbolts,
His wrath destroyed all men,
Punish deformity,
The wolf possessed Lycaon,

A lust for butchery,
Pleasure in the pools of blood,
He howls at the night he bleeds,

Bring down society,
Slaughter eternity,

Design a sect of hate,

Bring forth the blood of nine,
Chanting unholy priests,
At Mount Lycaeus' peak,
Prepare cannibal feast,

Feel how I pierce your Earth,
Sacrifice mortal dirt,
Revel Arcadia now,
The oxen death will plow,

End time, Rise,
New life, spine,
Evil curse, cries,
You must die!!!

Laissez Faire,"I've got a feeling that something is wrong
That look is telling me your not happy
We never listen to our favorite song
Do you remember the way you held me
No I won't let you work this love away
There was a time when you held me tight
Dreams of now and dreams of yesterday
Both have the heartache that you feel inside

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

So many times I look into your eyes
I see an image a man who's crying
You try to tell me, but I realize
It's had to make it, I'll keep on trying
Open up your heart let's get away
Just take my hand it will be alright
Leave all behind, come out ad play
We'll find the answer deep into the night

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

Memories of you and me
The many in love
Tell me I'll always be in paradise

Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air

I call her room there's no reply

Wrap this quilt of contradiction warm around you now
Stay strong, take care

Cost of this forgotten dream is written on my face
Who can tell the reason why there's a sun in this blue sky

Familiar things do change but in our minds they stay the same

And I let you back in?

And we're not even friends no more

But you leave me no other choice

How many times have you played with my mind

Lalo Mora,"Aguanta corazon no seas cobarde
Si te tienes que ausentar que sea por
No olvides que por lejos que te vallas
No sufres solo tu si no los dos

Yo se que te pegaron y muy fuerte
Yo se que es muy profundo tu dolor
Quien te manda querer profundamente
Ahora pagas el precio de amor

Si te aguantas como yo te lo he pedido
Y que nunca la dejes de adorar
Te prometo que ya nunca la dejamos
Donde quiera que he de ir la he de llevar

Tu sufres no ha de ser toda la vida
Tu bien sabes que algún día la he de encontrar
Y si ella nos quiere todavía
Ni la muerte nos puede separar

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance

Most live crippled by fear,
I'd rather walk it off on bloody stumps until I've bled dry
Yeah, we're all gonna die

[Chorus]
You brand it a crisis
I name it an honor
To face what arises
To remain unconquered

All the worst that I feared has come to pass
And despair is in an endless supply
I dug my way to bottom of the bloody truth
Buried beneath a spotless lie
I'm sworn to stay the course that I alone have chosen
Because we're all gonna die

[Chorus]

I'm cauterized
I'm cauterized
I'm gonna heat the blade (Unconquered)
I'm gonna ride this pain (Unconquered)

Life's a fatal disease without a cure
But as it kills me I'll stare right in it's eye
There's no way out
I'm sworn to stay the course that I alone have chosen
There's no way out
So how will you die?

There's no way out
There's no way out

Lamb of God,"I saw the world through the lens of a pinhole camera
I saw nothing, I was blind
In between a black hole and a super nova is where you’ll find me
Imploding and expanding simultaneously
No longer blind

I’d been running away for so long
When I finally caught myself there wasn’t much left
The script’s last page is blank
And the medicine is gone

A sick monster, a twister of dark matter
On a heavier trip than you can comprehend
A tornado trying to mend the life it shattered
Waiting for nothing to begin
A flat line, my insides are turning out

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

I keep walking past the places I was born in
Now their faces are blank, shiny, and dead
I don’t recognize a thing, I can’t recall them
A closed book that I can never read again
A flat line, my insides are turning out
The lights fade, this final war starts now

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

Killing me

All of that is ending now for I have arisen
Survived myself somehow, dead and imprisoned
I’m fighting to live if I am to see the day
I swear I’ll never sleep again
I am no man’s slave

I wanted the fog to lift but I was living in a cloud
Nostalgia is grinding the life from today
The present always dies in future memories
And King me is killing me
Cut wide open and bleeding to death for all to see

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

King me is killing me

He’s killing me
He won’t kill me
I won’t let him kill me
He won’t kill me",King Me

When the axis shifted
This is not the life I envisioned
What's done is done

Now the beast has come home to roost
He returns with blood on his hands
Caught in the trap of meeting
The laws of supply and reprimand

My blood is boiling
I can't feel my own skin
Though I can see it crawling
Can't expose all these sins
But I can see them falling

There's no escape from building tension
The pressure valve has been refitted
A lost plot in constant revision
A rising storm that's never abated
You can't know enough 'til too much
The envelope is decimated
Too far gone now to reverse my course and be subjugated
And my blood keeps boiling

I can't feel my own skin
Though I can see it crawling
Can't expose all these sins
But I can see them falling down

This is a labor of hate
Falling down
This is a labor of hate
Falling down

Lamb of God,"A thousand heads cut clean across their necks
right down the hall from me.
The reich's relentless blade, thirsty and shining red
still echoes of their screams.

This is a tarnished heirloom, passed down through iron fists
A shameful house of doom, a legacy of collapse.
Built on a painful truth.

A thousand years of failure, a thousand years they bled.
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father.
They just bowed their heads.

They meekly did their time
Counting the days while harnessed to their rusty shackles
Forever occupied, folded the crimson star,
The rabbits turned to jackals,
still echoes of their screams.

This is a tarnished heirloom, passed down through iron fists
A shameful house of doom, a legacy of collapse.
Built on a painful truth.

A thousand years of failure, a thousand years they bled.
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father.
They just bowed their heads.

Soviet hangover eastern bloc.
And dirty money still flows through locks.
A killing ground of rebels, black marketeers
Restrained, but there's no resistence here.

South-east Asia in a Euro cellblock.
Saigon's children conceal what they've got.
The opium trail runs west through here.
They're selling disease to erase all your fears.
still echoes of their screams,
still echoes of their screams.

A thousand years of failure, a thousand years they bled.
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father.
They just bowed their heads.
I won't bow my head.",Still Echoes [Live from Rock am Ring] [Live]
Lambchop,"Dust moves off his arms and chest 
As the vent window opens in his volkswagen 
Hundreds of impalas and stationwagons 
Idle at the train crossing 
The puddles that surround him 
Are always made from sweat 
The open sore on his face reminds him 
That his blood is simply temporary 

The gas is blowing in the trees 
One whiff has brought me to my knees 
At first you practice, practice to yourself 
You are the very air, you are the very air 
You are the very air he breathes 

His head throbs and fills 
With a big machine bag 
I must be the richest man 
To ever stand in line at the bank

was worried about the holocaust

he looked at the book 
he stared at her legs 
she stared at his look 
What a trip 
As the shop filled up with strangers 
some had big black boots 
some were lost teenagers 
Gotta go 
As he placed the book back on the table

he remembers her face

Lambchop,"the clerk smiled as she saw the same nut pick up a personal size grocery basket and head down aisle two. she smiled because periodically this guy would return with a basket full of glade lock and hold room freshener and deodorizer. it's a deodorizer that works on the same principle as a bug bomb. simply push down on the button and it fills the room with a scented fog. the man would buy only about five or six cans at a time. he'd been coming in for about five weeks now. sometimes he would come in twice a week. he seemed like a normal guy. he was kind of balding in his mid thirties wearing a black leather jacket. and he was always so damn dusty something soft about his features. it looked like it was makeup but it was just dust. he paid with a twenty and said thank you and left. 

when the man returned home he took the glade from the worthless little plastic sack. he placed one on the rug, one on the end table, one on the window sill, one under the TV, and one on the air conditioner. this might seem unusual except for the fact that his entire apartment was just filled with them. every room on every surface. he figured he had about sixty of them in all--each one's nozzle poised at the ready. he sighed and opened a beer. he started to push down the lock and hold buttons on the canisters, slowly filling the room, working his way from the dining room into the den. each room filling with a multiscented fog: desert bloom, evergreen, misty rose, fresh lemon, regular and unscented, pot porrouri, wild oak, petulia, ocean mist, musk, hazel wood, irish nights, sandal wood, rain forest, country kitchen, natural prevention?, orange blossom, indian summer, and holiday candle. calmly he sat on the couch, spilt his beer, and closed his eyes.

Cause he wanted to smell 
What was left of the girl 
That stayed at his hotel 
Still the water was warm 
With the soap in his hand 
As he halted the process 
Just to stare at this man 
In the dark of his room 
Right after his nap 
He buried his face in her pillow 
Then he stared down at his lap 
A small circle of miracles 
Surrounded his head 
That ranged dark blue 
All the way to dark red 

And in honor of this new affair 
He bought some socks and some underwear 
He was feelin' so sporty and lookin' brand new 
To cover up his invisible tattoo 

The box on the carpet 
Matched the lines on his head 
As he was ready to sleep 
And he turns down the bed 
Removes all his clothes now 
Lays them on the floor 
Slips under the covers 
He hears her key in the door 
His eyes blink for a minute 
His lids open and close 
A cool warmth fills the room 
He feels her chest on his nose 
His brow brushes her navel 
His hand follows her hips 
His neck jerks on the pillow 
Feels the touch of her lips 

And in honor of this new affair 
He bought some socks and some underwear 
He was feelin' so sporty and lookin' brand new 
To cover up his invisible tattoo 

But not as good as this invisible tattoo

To forests where I do belong
Close my eyes, little bit scared

And then my sun comes down
And you won't hold my hand, it's okay
Cause when my sun comes down
I'll be walking a darker way, it's okay, it's alright

And we can throw away the cane
And we can walk through God's own will

What will we have to eat tonight?
What if I told you it's okay
To be my action figure?

I've swallowed beer like a cartoon
And if old Waylon hung the moon
Will we be singing with him soon?

And I will learn to look away
When there are thing I cannot bear
Perhaps you'll sing a different tune
Perhaps we'll learn to tell the difference

And there are people that I know
Who learn to live within their limits
And we are lucky to be so

The glasses the clock the wall

It cannot get a hold of you,
It cannot get a hold of you,
It cannot get a hold of you.

It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone;

Lamont Dozier,"Do you remember the day
When you walked away
I never had a chance
To tell my story

I'd been out all night
Had too much to drink
And couldn't think

I just lost my job
And thought that I'd been robbed
And feeling lonely was to blame
For the lipstick stains

Just let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby

Ooh, wee

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knee
To get you back, baby
Yes, I will

You got me doing time
Going out of my mind

Honey, you got the key
Won't you set me free
Girl, have pity on me

I'll make the change
I'll rearrange everything
Cause there's no light without you

I got my head together
I promise never to
Hurt you again, baby

Let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Ooh, girl, ooh, honey

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knees
To get you back home, darling
Yes, I will

There's somebody out there lonely tonight
And for one reason or another
You're having trouble with your lover
Well, here's a lesson for free
Already been tested by me

If there's somebody you want bad enough
You won't mind pushing aside your pride
Cause whatever's needed to get over
You shoot your best shot
Give it all you got

It all depends on how much
You want it and how bad
Cause it definitely can be had
That's why I don't mind begging
Oh, yeah, for my lady

Now I want you all to sing along with me
Maybe my baby will feel sorry for me
And come on back home, right here

(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Oh, oh, yeah
(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Think I need to call my lady and tell her

To let me start tonight

want from me?
What God would make
you happy?
How much blood
Would quench your thirst?

If only I'd made tomorrow

Made tomorrow mine today
And now a million tomorrows
A million tomorrows pass away

The next time you see me
I hope you'll forgive me
For all the times I didn't, did not

It was like James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more

Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, no please, stay here
We don't need no money we can make it all work

I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
Cause Ima ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more-but that not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancin' all night
Then they took you away- stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

Softer than satin was the light

Feeling the rapture grow

Precious and warm a memory, through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears",Blue Velvet

Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
(With the boss)

Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Know we used to go break in
To the hotel pool, glittering we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, get us while we're hot
We don't give a what

This is what makes us girls
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for it's a curse

Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?

They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

This is what makes us girls
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

Darlin' little queens do you know what you're worth?
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl

Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure

A half-life in lost dreams
And not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day

In all the wrong places

Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on
'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather

Lana Del Rey,"Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present

Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been

Towards the door we never opened

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
'Cause I love you

Oh-oh-baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone
Regretting some little foolish thing
There's some simple thing that I've done

Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Turn it up, turn it up
And let's dance by the ocean, ooh-ooh

It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next morning
They put out the warning
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music
Tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

And what about all their parents
And what about about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses

I'd take my time 'fore I climb up to the top of it (stairway)

Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella, cool to win them over

He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down with his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going and to
Not want music 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children
And all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today
Maybe my contribution
Could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

One more bow (Remenber)

But now the spotlight's on you

Lana Lane,"The Emperor's garden
Of gold and crimson hues
Was a prision to a nightingale
Who sang of love
A love she dreamed of

One stormy night
Her cage fell to the ground
On a wind so cold it carried knives
Flying so righ
She touched the sky

Never looking back to the see the sadness
That she left behind
Never Knowing where the moon
Would guide her

As the night turns to day
And the stars kneel to pray
You can almost hear her song of life

Each passing day,the Emperor grew pale
Having lost his only sunshine
A broken heart tore him apart

One final breath was taken with a smile
As the velvet song of the nightingale
Flew so high
Piercing the sky

Never looking back to the see the sadness
That she left behind
Never Knowing where the moon
Would guide him

As the night turns to day
And the stars kneel to pray
You can almost hear her song of life
Throught the clouds on the mountains high
Lonely winds sing a lullaby
As the nightingale returns once more

With out flesh and bone

We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins while we put his wing together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

Where is your star
It is far, is it far, is it far
When do we leave, yeah

No sound as he falls instead of rising

Lana Lane,"I'm woven in a fantasy, I can't believe the things I see
The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall
And with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost
It rises now before me, a dark and silent barrier between
All I am and all that I would ever want to be
It's just a travesty, towering, marking off the boundaries 
My spirit would erase

To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak
And those are few who've seen it through to glimplse the other side
The promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride
The moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision's in the air
It's standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that's me
It's just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me
I want to see

Gold and diamonds cast a spell, it's not for me to know it well
The treasures that I seek are waiting on the other side
There's more that I can measure in the treasure of the love that I can find
And though it's always been with me
I must tear down the wall let it be
All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony
Shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross
There is no loss",The Wall

Sprech' ich seit Jahren mit dem Blick zum Grab
Geknickt mit mei'm Vater und frag ihn
„Was hat der Scheiß uns gebracht, man?""
Zwei Söhne, die es bis heut' zu nichts gebracht haben
Ich puffe und der Joint wird zu Asche
Hab bis heut' nichts bereut, was ich machte
Hab Freunde betrogen und 'n paar auch verloren
Frauen verarscht und bin verarscht worden
Ey, ich hab Groupies gefickt, Doubies gekifft
Und will seit fünf Jahren von mei'm Bruder nix wissen
Letztendlich hätt' ich allerhand voll zu reden
Doch füll' mein Album nicht mit privaten Problemen

Mein Leben ist Girls, Kush, Cash für die Medien
Weil ich mit den' über nichts and'res reden will
Sollte es auch nicht ankommen, gebe ich kein' Fick
Sterb' noch vor 30, das weiß ich
Ich ziehe die Fäden, spiel' mit den Medien
Red' nicht mit ihnen über Probleme
Sollte es auch nicht ankommen, gebe ich kein' Fick
Sterb' noch vor 30, das weiß ich

Das weiß ich, das weiß ich, das weiß ich

Lance Butters,"Er rappt jetzt auch, klingt nach unserem Sound
Was ich rapp', lebt er jetzt aus
Denn er wär' gerne wie ich ein hochnäsiger Wichser
24/7 immer dicht, yeah
Er hört Wu-Tang, „Brooklyn Zoo” läuft im Loop, denn
Was ich gut find', findet er gut, wenn
Wir uns auf meiner Show dann begegnen
Erste Reihe, derbe am Feiern, denn seit der Selfish EP
Hat er endlich 'n Selbstwertgefühl
Sagt, keine Bitch hat ihn überhaupt nur verdient
Denn wenn er was liebt, dann höchstens das Weed
Weed, Weed, und er zieht bis zum geht nicht
Mehr, zieht immer mehr, sein Kopf dreht sich
Wer mich nicht kennt lernt mich jetzt durch ihn kenn'
Album auf Play, es geht „Lance Butters, bäm”

Sie sind addicted, tausende Kids fiebern mit
Doch keinem da draußen gibt dieser Sound
Auch nur im geringsten, das was er ihm gibt

Ey, ey, schau mal ich hab unsere
Tickets für's Lance Konzert endlich bekommen
Ey, beste!
Isso
Stell dir vor der raucht danach noch einen mit uns
Boah, bäm

Sie trägt Comme des Fuckdown aber nicht wegen A$AP
Kauft jeden Scheiß den sie bei mir gesehen hat
Nach, übersteht den Tag ganz nur noch mit Gras
Sie macht es nicht durch mich, sagt sie
Doch wir wissen es besser
Verpeste ein ganzes Land mit Desinteresse
Und das nur durch die Texte, rotz' ihn's hin und sie fressen's
Frag nach ihrem Lieblingsact, sie sagt „Lance Butters, beste.”
Egal, was man fragt, sie antwortet in Sätzen
Aus meinen Tracks die sie niemals vergisst
Ey, des ist, ey, des ist, wie sie spricht
Sie ist an sich keine Bitch, aber für so 'n Fick
Nach diesem Gig, da spricht nichts, und so sitzt sie
Wieder da mit dem Blick aus dem Fenster
Wenn die Snare klatscht, geht es „Lance Butters, hands up”

Lance Butters,"Ey, schon wieder 'n Tag, wo nichts geht
Brauche Weed, doch bin zu bequem
Herauszugehen, geschweige denn aufzustehen
Doch Jacke an und raus in das Leben
Und so mach' ich mich täglich
Auf den Weg in mei'm klein' Städtchen
Beweg' mich hin zu mei'm Bro, vielleicht geht was
Von mir aus auch nur 'n bisschen für später
Doch da ist nix, mal wieder
Dealer im Urlaub, wann kommt dieser Wichser
Und ey, ich verabscheue diesen Kack-Bundesstaat
Mit dreitausend Euro für 'n scheiß Gramm bestraft
Doch bis heut nicht bezahlt

Die Bitch sagt „Ich hab dich noch nie hier gesehen”
Und ich sag „Ich auch nicht”
Denn eigentlich sitz ich jeden Abend komplett dicht rum zuhause
Und rauch ein zwei drei oder vier kein Plan wie viel
Ey, die scheiße verwirrt, aber zurück zum Thema
Du bist 'n Mädel und ich hab 'n Penis, da könnt' doch was gehen
Sie meint ich sei zu direkt auf 'ne Art
Und Weise (prü-)prüdes Stück Scheiße
Und ich weiß was jetzt kommt, du quatschst dumm rum
Ich soll dich erobern und ich flüster's ins Ohr

Komm mit Heim, wovor hast du Angst?
Beschwer dich danach wenn du willst oder kannst
Dis ist nur 'n Angebot, was ich dir mach'
Nimm's an, lehn's ab, fuck it

Acten auf Bühnen, springen rum wie psychisch Labile
Was fühlen die, was ich nicht fühle?
Auf Deutschrap ist geschissen
Eh alles talentfreie Wichser
Was wollen die vom Leben erzählen?
Eure Melancholie zieht vielleicht bei Mädels
Aber nicht bei mir, man
Tausend Rapper mit beschissener Beatwahl
Wieso fragt ihr nach files by Bennett?
Doch seid dann zu Scheiße, um darauf zu rappen
Huh? Nichts als Desinteresse
Für Tracks ohne Style, doch mit enddeeper Message
Auch, wenn ihr auf Sendern rotiert
Hab ich mehr Hoes gefickt als ihr
Und vielen Dank an die 3, 4 wenigen
Typen, die Rap back brachten in die Medien
Yeah, ich will da eh nicht hin
Scheiß drauf, für wen die Wege geebnet sind
Ihr habt 'ne Erwartungshaltung
Gegenüber mei'm Album, man, sei's drum
Alles, was ihr macht, ist, ihr reimt ein paar Worte
Wieso sollte ich es feiern, wenn ihr mein' Sound supported?
Guck, das Ding ist ganz einfach
Ich kill eure Flows locker im Vorbeifahr'n
Denn würden alle einfach machen, statt zu reden
Gäbe es hier auch viel mehr gute Gegner

That's what he said to you?”

Weiter nicht darauf liegen wie man rappt

Und nennst sie Neuerfindung des Rades?
Hoffe die werden allesamt floppen

Denn an und für sich bedeutet's mir nichts

Nein, du führst nicht gleich ein Modelabel
Nur weil auf dei'm Merch deine Slogans stehen
Und nur weil du bei deinen Clips jetzt eigens Regie führst
Bist du noch lange nicht scheiß Steven Spielberg

Mein Verständnis für Rap ist seit fünf Jahren weg
Denn jede Hitsingle die ihr released habt war dreck
Stürmt ruhig Herzen von kleinen Gören
Ich fick solang' Bitches die härteres mögen
Ja, ich bin beim Major gesigned
Du bei Typen deren Zeit längst vorbei ist, guck
Ihr seid keine G's, keine Hänger
Nur lachhafte Männer wie Michael Wendler
Und deine Team Member sind nur Freelancer
Die nicht mehr hinter dir stehen wenn der Profit weg ist
Red' deshalb nicht von 'ner Gang
Wenn du Dienstleister meinst die am Schreibtisch häng'
Ihr habt die Kacke nicht studiert
Doch achtet auf dem Lappen neuerdings auf Melodien (Yeah)

Macht dich zu echt nichts besond'res
Und ich piss' auf euren Contest
Steh' nicht im Kreis mit paar Pennern und perform Acapella

Wie man sieht liegt einiges im Argen
Es geht doch schließlich darum wie man chartet
Nee, ich heb' kein' belehrenden Finger
Aber eure Mucke hören nur verblendete Kinder
Konsumgeil wie immer, stürmen den Laden
Und für euch läuft alles wieder so wie geplant, huh?
Sollt' mein Album auch Teil davon werden
Ist meins immerhin den Trubel auch wert

Hast dein' Fokus auf Promo gelenkt

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Lance Hayward,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Lance Hayward,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand

Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

There will come a day

I won?t fall apart at the mention of your name

My tears will all be washed away

I hope and pray

There will come a day


There will come a time

I?ll smile when you cross my mind

Regrets will all be left behind

I?ll be fine

There will come a time


With memories as strong as this

How can my fragile heart resist

Drifting through the way we were back then

But as long as I keep holding on

To someone who?s already gone

How can the healing begin?


As long as there?s a breath in me

Apart of you will always be

The way the losing you still hurts

Somewhere near the center of my soul

I hope my humble prayer will work

Make half a man Once again feel whole


There will come a love

I hope its half as sweet as ours was

With a little help from up above

I could love again

But until then

I hope and pray

There will come a day

The red and white stripes, they would blend
Them warm, washed-out lips
Ripped magazines to you is all I could send

Troubled heart folded
And doubled right over
Mon coeur, c'est fort
Perdu tout pouvoir

Avec moi, avec toi, avec coeur
Avec un et c'est pris
Nos têtes, nos langues
Nos oreilles étaient toujours remplies

Mais les histores et chansons de la perte d'innocence
M'ont tellement hanté
Que j'ai remis mes mains dans mes poches
Et ma langue dans ma propre tête

Troubled heart folded
And doubled right over
Mon coeur, c'est fort
Perdu tout pouvoir

You get down to the level

Landon Pigg,"Fairy tales can come true
It could happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh while your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or it's on its way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart, heart
