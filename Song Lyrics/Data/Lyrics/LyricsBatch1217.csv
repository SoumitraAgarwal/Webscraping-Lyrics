The Deadly Venoms,"Yo, N-Tyce got, a lot, heat packin' out
I don't care what you rappin' bout
I don't care what your gun clappin' but, blackin' out
How the roses is actin' out, lackin' clout

Aiyo, I don't give a fuck, how many albums you drop
How many niggaz in the streets, who be givin' you props
How many thorough chicks you know, who be blowin' the spot
Who keep it gangster, Pretty Thugs, though we takin' it

And I don't care what you spittin', as long as I stay hittin'
Bangin' in the clubs or the cars, gettin' tipsy
At the crib or the bar, toured out, easy star
Believe me, huh

I don't care about the cars and the jeeps
I just care about the bars when I creep
Hard when I speak, steady holdin' cards when I cheat
More than a fleet, part in the week, stars in the heat

Aiyo, I don't give a fuck, how many chips you stack
How many rappin' chicks you get to appear on your track
How many Grammy's you accept, 'cause you still way wack
How many times I gotta tell you that the Venoms is back

New millennium, 20-02, it's all on you
And I could care less about what you been through
And don't nobody bring me
No bad news, 'cause it's real in the game

I don't care, 'cause I'm sick and tired
Of being sick and tired, my click is firee
D.V.'s gotta get the flyer
Remember the name, we got hits to hire

Aiyo, how many timese have I told you, we be droppin' them hits
How many days we bee spazzin', blackin' out in the pit
How many nights, we be spittin', tag teaming on chicks
Late night, up at the session, then it's back to the grits

I don't care what you think about us, Venoms still can't be touched
Ya'll cats just ain't fast enough
To roll with us, livin' fabulous
The ghetto way, to play around when it's time to get paid

I don't care about the ice and the chains
I'm just nice in the game, even when I flip nice
Guaranteed to hit tricks twice, when I range
Rip shit bright when I bring, cock when I aim

Aiyo, how many times that I told, we gon' change the game
And I don't even gotta say it, you be knowin' the name
But I'mma say it anyway, 'cause it's all the same
Deadly Venoms is the squad, as world peep gamee

Any niggaz could rap, 'cause of me, your career's a wrap
Watch yourself when it's time to react
D.V.'s bring it back to the map, yo, it's time to attack
Smackin' your ass, so watch your back

[Chorus]",Don't Care
The Deadly Venoms,"[Intro: N-Tyce]
Yo, yo

[N-Tyce]
While you on interviews on M.T.V.
I'm in the country, sippin' beer, and I've done been through three
'Cause see me, I'm just a regular person
You got a sound, I can make a remix and do a better version

I keep it real on the mic because I hate an actor
I ain't sayin' I'm the best, but I'm your favorite rapper
Plus I'm hungry, I ain't ate in a year
My ends is runnin' high, and I'm debatin' wit scare

But I'mma, crank it and steer, sittin' butt naked wit beer
Thinkin' of ways how I can make it this year
If you're all ready platinum and probably got a plaque or two
I'm still crackin' brew, ate up rhymes attackin' you

It's like I stick to the track wit glue
You think you hot 'cause you so and so, well chick, I'm a rapper too
And I don't care what you rap about
I got a check account, nigga we can put our own record out

[Chorus: Pearl Handle]
Don't stop, don't stop, no time outs
It's hot, breathe, I need a loud mouth to scream
If you all, out and about, the street club or the house
And you need heat through your speakers, don't stop

[Chorus: Naisha]
Don't stop, don't stop, no time outs
It's hot, breathe, I need a loud mouth to scream
If you all, out and about, the street club or the house
And you need heat in your speakers, don't stop

[Champ M.C.]
Yo, don't speak 'cause the Champ still got it
Might of took a fall, but keep money in my pocket
Hustle hard on these concrete's, these are my seeds
I gots to eat, my bodyguard is a heater ho

Pretty but bold, don't speak unless told
The more of some shit, think quick
Don't get caught up in a paint box of blood
Spread you wit another damn hit

Throwin' curve balls, hittin' a, herb all ya'll
Keep a gangsta rich, got ya'll hatin' this bitch
Venom, is the only type of present I give 'em
Deadly, but y'all still fearin' the rhythm

Gotta get this paper, shit on all you haters
Especially them imitators, got you stealin' my favor
It ain't nothin', I'm callin' you bluff, just because I know you ain't tough
It ain't over, the time out, nowhere to run and you're all crimed out

[Chorus: Pearl Handle]

[Chorus: Naisha]

[J-Boo]
Yo, recognize a thorough bitch, when you see one
Pretty thug, 5'10"", ya'll bitches got no wins
Why you want to act up and front in front of your friends?
Why you want to test the skills that's bringin' me in?

The question still remains: Can Venom Rock?
Can Venom really blow the spot? Come on, now, stop
Ask yourself what chicks is keepin' it hot
Fitted bomb shit through your boom box, ridin' through your block

Niggas always want to know who's the best?
Deadly Venom, Fox Brown, Lil' Kim, fuck the rest
Yea, you heard right, I spit game, my shit is tight
And to the rest of you lame ass chicks, ya'll be aight

I keep it gangsta, I spit hood, it's all good
Why you actin' Holly Hood, when your album went wood
I call it how I see it, ya'll chicks is trash
want to bump me and my click? Don't make me laugh

It ain't a mystery why so many hatin' on us
I know you mad, 'cause we got the world waitin' on us

The Deal,"The wall of this world
It's falling down
And the ceiling of humanity
It hits the ground
We've lost all respect
The will to live
And our brothers and sisters
Show no will to give

Falling down
This world is falling down
We don't care for one another
And there's no one around
Falling down
This world is falling down
We gotta gotta gotta gotta
Turn this around

We think we've all got it

Wait a second
Can't we see we've been lied to
Turn around
And proclaim the truth",Tell the Truth
The Deal,"Story 'bout a friend of mine
Sick of trying all the time
The batlle rages in his mind

Silenced by the demon as the young man begins to weep
Losin' his life to bottled lies and begins to admit defeat
Thinkin' where did he go wrong as the demon tears out his soul
His flesh is lyin' to his heart it's saying he's got no place to go

He tried his own way again and again
Just can't win
Fighting a battle he was sure he couldn't win
Pondering his past and questioning his life
Just can't win
Losing a war he knows he just can't win

Thought about the friends he's lost along the way
Went crazy shot down dead ends and desolate streets
Givin' up was easy when there is nothin' but distrust and deceit
Always having to watch his back in fear as he's dragging his feet",The Attack
The Dear Hunter,"Everything you'd live and die for
Reasons leading you through here
Perished matriarchal bonds
Failing innocence of love
When the world beckons your approach
It swallows you whole

You'll believe what you're led to believe
In the hands of ghosts we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

Pray'd I would leave this place someday
Joined to alarm from long ago now unconcerned
Euphorically floating upon wax wings where is the sun?
I still see her face; her beauty, her grace
Transfixed like a light in front of me
It follows my soul
And swallows me whole

You'll believe what you're led to believe
In the hands of ghosts we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

Left, right, left, right...

His branches reached so far before
His leaves were bold extremities with great control
Wasted along; he died alone

You'll believe what you're led to believe
In the hands of ghosts we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

She's inanimate, bloodless elegance
Fatal fascination breeds a bloom of misery
Helpless hiding tongues, bathed in revulsion
Here lies possibility wilting premature

But the right hand hates the left and the sea's upset with the sky
So we press on in spite of the spite
Happiness is a knife when the worlds on its side and your minds on fire

Trying to find the trouble with the trouble I've found
Begging my god to make the wheels go round
Eat so much but I never get full
Earth opened up and swallowed us whole",The Lake and the River
The Dear Hunter,"Even if you'd never strayed from me,
I'd question your fidelity.
There'd always be a shroud of suspicion
And my heart's a liability
With your hands maroon, so freshly red,
You'd wrap your lips around my neck.
Try and force to love the thought of me.
Simple motions make me ill.

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned
On an undercover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good.
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me.
He's so much better.
They're all much better.
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt, and get to work.

Maybe this is just a work of art.
Scripted players in a play of lust.
Hope the end is well worth waiting for
Everything you wished there'd be

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned
On an undercover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good.
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me.
He's so much better.
They're all much better.
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt, and get to work.

Oh my god, what have I done?
Now my darling, put your clothes back on.
Oh my god, what have I done?
Now my darling, put your clothes back on.

Cause you can't be caught red-handed if you're not red-handed.
My darling, if I ever said those words to you,
I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve
On display for you to see, I'm on display.

Because you can't be caught red-handed if you're not red-handed.
My darling, I would never say those words to you.

The Dear Hunter,"When we dance
It looks just like fire

As everything descends
Oh, what a mess

The Dear Hunter,"There was a silver circle sign
And she was standing at the door
We pressed our way right through the crowd
Our pace was quickened to her floor

There was a single fading light
And there was silk all on the wall
She had a lot of love to give
I was prepared to take it all
[But what did she do next?]

She had disrobed
And she was waiting on the floor
She asked me what it was I want
I thought that I wanted it all
[What did you say?]

I said ""stand up and move your body to the bed""
She quickly stood and turned
And here's exactly what she said
""Please be soft and sweet to me,
This life has not been good you see.
It's hard with such a history
Buried in misery.""
[And what did you do next?]

I broke a smile reminding that I paid her well
(Her lips were turned?)
And then I felt her hands
Unbuckling my belt
[So was it good?]

Oh, it felt like heaven
But I'm sure she was in hell
I made it clear I'd get my moneys worth
Out of the good she sells

In the cradle we're helpless, but on our feet we
are fatal. How we evolve and grow into
twisted beasts with desire for disorder.

terrible game we play
Replacing a pawn for a body

who say what they need to say.

Now with hands aligned, arms move

You were crying under the covers
For a way to escape, to escape

Oh God, where have I gone?
And will I ever get the ones I tell to believe me?
All the things I have done
To keep those around from learning to read me

I could tell, there was nothing left for us
When you turned, oh, you turned your back
But in the arms of another
You were crying under the covers
For a way to escape, to escape

So I guess I'm pressing on without you
I hope it goes the way you want to
Nothing ever seems like it does

Through the lights of beacon street

She's weeping

'Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling
On her petticoats
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors
In the jolly boat
See how they approach? 

With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
Or screamin'

And they row her out to packets
Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle
And she's laid in bed 
On the upper deck

And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Til at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions
In their opinions

And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin
Or she'll end up dead
And they throw her thirty dollars
And return her to the harbor

I wasted it all just to watch you go

And even though I tried, it all fell apart

Will eventually be a memory of a time when

It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

The Decemberists,"Ramblin', where to begin
I taste the summer on your peppery skin
Been saved the warmer the waves
I felt a slip into a watery grave

My girl, linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand, the bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand

And summer arrives with a length of lights
And summer blows away
And quietly gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave

Waylay, the din of the day
Boats bobbing in the blue of the bay
In deep far beneath
All the dead sailors slowly slipping to sleep

My girl, linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand, the bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand

And quietly gets swallowed by a wave

All the bellies and the bones and the bile
Though I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with a child

And we could get each other through the night

We are one and we are two
And we are simply wicked to a tee
Never a better thing was said
Than I for you and you were made for me

Well, I heard that your plans were all fouled up
And I heard that you hit the wall
Hit your smarting arms and skinned your knees
Will you drop your sling and stone?
And you can't make it on your own
You see, it's I for you and you were made for me

When you were young your parents said
You act like that, you do it on your own time
So you grew up on crooked bends
So barely there you couldn't walk a straight line

Well, here we are and where we came and
It's a pretty sticky wicket, isn't it, dear?
A few missteps along the way
But I'm really pretty happy to be here

To the bums on the Broadway Bridge
Raise a glass to the bones of the Circle K

Could be taken by magic and placed in a boat
Where every rising swell
Would sweep us at our will across the sky

Then tempest never, or weather dire
Could ever make our blissful living cease
No, but abiding in a steady, blessed peace
Together in harmony

And Lady Vanna and Lagia then

Would join us at the enchanter's behest

From keeping shotgun shy, all arise

And the Panamanian child
Stands at the Dowager Empress's side
And all the remains is the arms of the angel
And all the remains is the arms of the angels

And you've receded into loam
And they're picking at your bones
Will call cold

Will we gather to conjure the rain down
Will we now
Build a civilization below ground

We are all our hands in holders
But meet this bold and brilliant sun

Upon a cliff that towers towards the trees

And all my teens in tow
Stuffed in strata of clothes

Wandering the gray memorial park

Heralding a summer's early sway
And all the bulbs all comin' in
To begin
The thrushes' bleeding battle with the wrens
Disrupts my reverie again

Pegging clothing on the line
Training jasmine how to vine
Up the arbor to your door
And more
Standing on the landing with the war
You shouldered all the night before

But once upon it
The yellow bonnets
Garland all the lawn
You were waking
Day was breaking
A panoply of song
And summer comes to Springville Hill

A barony of ivy in the trees
Expanding out its empire by degrees
And all the branches burst abloom
In the boom
Heaven sent this cardinal maroon
To decorate our living room

But once upon it
The yellow bonnets
Garland all the lawn
You were waking
Day was breaking
A panoply of song
And summer comes to Springville Hill

And years from now when this old light
Isn't ambling anymore
Will I bring myself to write
""I give my best to Springville Hill""

The Decemberists,"I had entered into a marriage
In the summer of my twenty-first year
And the bells rang for our wedding
Only now do I remember it clear
Alright, alright, alright

No more a rake and no more a bachelor
I was wedded and it whetted my thirst
Until her womb start spilling out babies
Only then did I reckon my curse
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers
Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn
Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery
Mercifully taking her mother along
Alright, alright, alright

What can one do when one is widower
Shamefully saddled with three little pests
All that I wanted was the freedom of a new life
So my burden I began to divest
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Charlotte I buried after feeding her foxglove
Dawn was easy, she was drowned in the bath
Isaiah fought but was easily bested
Burned his body for incurring my wrath
Alright, alright, alright

To be living so easy and free

Fell away and all the sunken cities would reveal themselves to you

I wrote it down and threw it all away

You tattered me, you tethered me to you
The things you would, the things you wouldn't do
To tell the truth, I never had a clue

Now we arise, the curse is young suburban villains
In their ill begotten children from the lawn
Come to me now, and on the station wagon window
Set the ghost of your two footprints
And they might haunt me when you're gone
And when the light grows dark, you were forever gone
But I remember you, you would fall
Well you were full and sweet as honey dew

Well I wrote it down and threw it all away

Was bedding on the netting when the rigging went slack
Was a moonless night, the stars are lending light

You never really know

And all the little bones that he hid in his vent

With open doors

Living life with broken skis

& she didn't know
With one blow I softly send the message home

I took her down

Didn't see it coming, but it just got worse
I lay her down by the lake

Would he see himself in me?

To feel my breath on his neck

The Deighton Family,"Two little boys had two little toys 
Each had a wooden horse 
Gaily they played each summer's day 
Warriors both of course 
One little chap then had a mishap 
Broke off his horse's head 
Wept for his toy then cried with joy 
As his young playmate said 


Did you think I would leave you crying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Jack and don't be crying 
I can go just as fast with two 
When we grow up we'll both be soldiers 
And our horses will not be toys 
And I wonder if we'll remember 
When we were two little boys 


Long years had passed, war came so fast 
Bravely they marched away 
Cannon roared loud, and in the mad crowd 
Wounded and dying lay 
Up goes a shout, a horse dashes out 
Out from the ranks so blue 
Gallops away to where Joe lay 
Then came a voice he knew 


Did you think I would leave you dying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon be flying 
I can go just as fast with two 
Did you say Joe I'm all a-tremble 
Perhaps it's the battle's noise 
But I think it's that I remember 
When we were two little boys 


Do you think I would leave you dying 
There's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon by flying 
Back to the ranks so blue 
Can you feel Joe I'm all a tremble 
Perhaps it's the battle's noise

I saw your friends today and they all said you're great
They mentioned something that the planets can exist

If dreaming's not wrong in love

Seeing if we're strong enough

And we'll find people more intelligent than you
And they're not bothered if the planets can exist

But how can I let you proceed when there's only one view?
Simple to state but don't dare implicate that I'm wrong
I'll dish the dirt and I'll show you the door
And if you keep coming I'll tell you to try a little, harder

All the freedom in my brain, I'm alright now
I'm just thinking what to say 
Sorry doesn't seem to wash 
when there's truths around that I have quashed 
and no one, I mean no one, can depress me more than I can
So does that make me weak or should that make me sick?

leave the footballs to their pints

who will win and who will lose?

Hey there, don't declare optimist it's clear you resist
I try all the time to get it right and still it persists 
Touched that you think I'm a heartless old crank
and there's things that I've done to convict me of that
Try to look out eyes straight and fast

Out by the fence there's a shout that I'm dead
Get me out of this place, I'll take casuals another day
All gates are locked, there's no way I can walk
and the paths that I took led me into the swamp

You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night

The Dells,"Some people often break up over silly things

Can we skip that part baby, in our lives, oh baby

Stay with me
Oh, can we skip that part baby, in our lives
Stay with me, lay with me, baby

Can you see I want you in my life
I'm not saying who's wrong or who's right
So let's not go on with this madness
If we do it will only end up in sadness

Fast cars and swimming pools and fancy homes
But they don't got it made the way we do
My satisfaction's guaranteed just loving you

Just a little bit more of your love

The Derailers,"Most of the time she's happy and everything is fine
And I feel so lucky knowing she's mine
But there's a lonely wind that blows and a place she sometimes goes
And I have to tell myself just give her time

You know what she's like when she gets the blues
Nothing I can say, nothing I can do
I couldn't love her more, I hate to see her cry
We've been here before, you know what she's like

When a man loves a woman, he'll always try
To be understanding when there's tears in her eyes
But neither wine nor roses can unlock the door that closes
And that's when my heart is there to tell my mind

You know what she's like when she gets the blues
Nothing I can say, nothing I can do
I couldn't love her more, I hate to see her cry

If I'm missin' something, I don't care
I don't feel like hangin' out
There's nothin' I wanna do
I just wanna be alone with you

It's been so long since we've been alone
I wanna make the most of it
Savor every little bit we can

Tonight I think I'll give the car a rest

And went away to Vegas
With my guitar and my dreams
I had to try to play and sing in Vegas

But my momma told me I was wrong
And she begged me to stay at home
But my will was strong and
I had to make it big in Vegas

They'll put my name up in lights where I'm playin'
And the lines out in front will be long
I'll get a standing ovation from the people
When I start to sing my song
When I turn 'em on in Vegas

But I've played every honky tonk
And smokey bar in Vegas
And I guess that I don't have
What it takes for Las Vegas

But my dreams still linger on
Though my faith is almost gone
But my will is strong and
I've gotta make it big in Vegas

This hopeless destiny:
A tragic, lost endeavor.

The Devil Wears Prada,"Will I ever forgive myself?
The same question, it's never fading.
I watch her wings eclipse the light of day.
It keeps coming back. 
Right now

I'm fighting the war rather than war itself.
I'm caught in the midst of no redemption.
I'm fighting the war rather than war itself.
The same dream over and over, over and over.

I thought I could be more
Than simply a victim.
I fight through sleepless nights
Without an answer. 
Somehow

I'm fighting the war rather than war itself.
I'm caught in the midst of no redemption.
I'm fighting the war rather than war itself.

Some say there's hope in this, there is love.
Show me her eyes, I'll feel her hair.
I'll be back to déjà vu.

Will I ever forgive myself?

The Devil's Anvil,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

I'd do all the things you'd have me do

I'd whip myself with razor wire for you

That after all this time
I almost made you smile

Through my life I have seen
This love come and go
There's no in-between

I have seen something
Altogether more serene

And you will see
Your eyes light up again like mine

The fever run through life

The Devlins,"I feel the storm, but it's so strange
To feel desire without the pain
And I feel your eyes search my soul
For something sacred, for something more than you need

Your words are lost, there's no aim
It's pure emotion that holds this flame
And the rain will fall and touch your heart
It's pure devotion alone in the dark

[Chorus: ]
So tell me what you feel
Tell me every little thing
Tell me all that you are now
And tell me what it's like to see
From your own heart
Now I've got you
Alone in the dark

The shadows fall all around
There's no one to harm you here, nowhere to be found
And it seems like we've been lost in the world of our
Own thoughts
There's no one I'd rather be with now until the end

The Devlins,"You took me up, took me higher baby
As far as you can go
You lit the flame of my desire

The sunny streets of my hometown
Where we began to play
And the feelings deep inside my heart
Will never fade away

See I try, try, try, but that's no good for you
If you really feel you need to work it out

Take a trainride to the mountainside
And let it all fade away

And the happiness that you gave me honey
I will always save
You see the cool breeze of love just blew and then it went away

You see I try, try, try, but that's no good for you

I used to feel weightless, now I'm pretty hard to lift

You say, what you want to say
In my arms I know your home
If you go, where you gonna go?
And leave me on my own...to drift alone

And somewhere along the thin white line
I'm spending my days and nights waiting for you to show
You say what you want to say...

You said maybe I should go
And I spin into a haze, waiting for you to show

Waiting for the call
To take me somewhere
I can't find

And you stay sometimes
But never long enough
Am I asking too much
For your nights?

'Cause every time you go
I feel I'm losing something
Every time you leave
It hurts my mind

The fading light
Takes you from my arms
And finds you somewhere
Outside again

So I lose myself
In someone else's charms
I can't hold them to my heart
And take you back again

Is that what you want...?",Everytime You Go
The Devlins,"I see you're angry with the things you did
And I know you will be lost until
You find a reason that can make you see my wish

And now I'm watching as you swing your dress
And your friends may cool your own distress
But you could change it all with
Just one kiss, one kiss

CHORUS
'Cause I don't want to be like this...for too long

And the words are racing through my head
But they need to come from you instead
So close your eyes and think of all the things you miss

The days are growing colder now
And I'm lost when you don't come around
But you could change it all with

CHORUS",I Don't Want to Be Like This
The Devlins,"They said the world was a different place
Through the eyes of another face
They said the change would be slow in coming round

They said the sky would be burning bright
And all the angels would begin to fight
Over the reason why there's no seasons
And there'll be no day and night

...But I knew that

I heard the words you were telling me
I heard your lies, your stupidity
But all these things you say to me
You just don't understand

...You see I knew that

And if you look maybe you might find
The words came from another mind
And if you think that you've got it right
Well maybe you should stand and fight

They tried to talk but it was no good
They said you'd leave and I knew you would
I knew the time and I knew the place
But through the eyes of another face

I saw the words that were in your head
I heard the thoughts that remained unsaid
I tried to talk but it's much too late

...But I knew that!

What do you say when love is gone
...I said I knew that",I Knew That
The Devlins,"I feel like I've been lost somewhere
And I find out why I'm here again
And time stretches across my mind
Spins all the way around

And now I find myself alone
My head without a home
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

CHORUS
And where will you be
When all this is coming down?
With time to kill
Where will you be
When all this is coming down?
You're a necessary evil

You lit a fire with the sweetest kiss
I saw the flame and I held my hand to it
And I know that if I ever miss you'll
Burn me to the ground

And now I'm lost within myself
I'm losing self respect
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

You've changed me now
I search for something new
And I hurt myself but I can't see it through

The Devlins,"Every time I look at you
I think of all the things we could do
And all the happiness you could use

'Cause if you're looking kind of sad about it
Tell me, what you need?

CHORUS
Anything that you want done baby
Anything at all
Any tie you need me
I'll return your call, yes I will

You know I've got so much more
Than you will ever need

CHORUS",Turn You Around
The Devlins,"It feels like my thoughts
Could run into your mind
ANd say the things that I can't say

And all of this time
I'm thinking to myself
The only thing I see is you
My life runs through
Your heart will be a place for me

Night speeds so fast
It's easy now
I cut myself on these thoughts of you
And I hear your voice
I'm running now into your world
That takes me near the edge of real
My mind to steal each night with you
Make everything seem new

CHORUS
And it feels like I'm
Spending all my time
Chasing dreams I wish so would come true
If you hold the knife
I would take my life
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
Until the light shines through

Nothing changes now my heart stands still
You could part my will to live

CHORUS",Until The Light Shines Through
The Devlins,"Say you got caught holding the goods
Everything we talked about
Just up in smoke the way you see it
Maybe it hurts just like it should
Maybe you saw yourself in
Someone else's perfect figure, I don't care

Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
Tell me that you can
Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
See, as of now you'll disappear

You're saying your dreams feel so good
Standing on the corner, baby
Shoot the breeze above your knees
Everything works just like it should
Finger on the trigger now so click your heels
And make some deals from now on

Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
Tell me that you can
Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
Pretty soon you'll disappear

In the meantime I guess all life is in your hands
It didn't work out like you planned, it didn't

So tell me when you come around, could you hear that sound?
When you come around, can you hear that sound?
Tell me when you come around, baby, can you hear that sound?
Oh when you come around, did you hear that sound?

Waiting for the curse that will not come
Try to rearrange yourself
But nothing you can do could change it
Now everything adds up to one
It's raining in your head but look outside
The sun's still shining, so don't ask why

Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
Tell me that you can
Did you ever stop to wonder why you're here
See, as of now you'll disappear

Pretty soon you'll disappear
Yeah, I'll watch you disappear
As of now you disappear
Disappear, oh, yeah

The Devlins,"Lay your hands upon me
Lay my head down low
Take this sickness from me
From my world below

Deep in the nighttime sky
Choose your words so slowly
To watch you now I wonder why

Hold me close, I feel it coming
Far away and out of sight
Hold me close, I know it's coming
Changes to our lives
So kill with me tonight

Know these days will take you
Know it won't be long
Could you do it for me?
Could you be that strong?

And your mind may weaken
You may find yourself
Lost alone and bleeding
But for now there's no one else

So just hold me close, I know it's coming
Far away and out of sight
Hold me close, I feel it coming
Changes to our lives
So kill with me tonight

Hold me close, I feel it coming
Far away and out of sight
Please, you know I forget nothing

That things worked out okay for now

Could disappear without a trace

'Cause I'm reckless, yeah
'Cause I'm reckless

Somewhere along the way
You raised your hand up to my face
And said you never should look back
Experience has taught us that

And I tried, I tried, yeah I tried
But I still feel out of place and strange

'Cause I'm reckless
'Cause I'm reckless, now

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
A'neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""you do not know, silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you, take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence""",Sounds of Silence

Between reality and make believe
Where daddy's just a memory
And Heather's got two mommies

Memories of moments that are gone
When first she looked at me
And sipped her drink across from me

Newborn hell was it all along
Right there with me, inside
Reflecting on the outside
If it won't die can I

Some days I look at things
As if they never existed
And others it's all right here
I've been thinking aloud
About the way it went
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right now
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right

Best of them all
Why wouldn't you see
The memories long gone

And an old man pay 
The way she took my money 
Was a crying shame

She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar

On her trail

They'd chase her by the mail 
  
She got picked up 
And then was put in jail 
Stroked the judge 
Just to go her bail

She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car

To go to Kalamazoo 
Made her a fortune 
Out of fools like you 
  
Met her a rich man 
Who was married and had some kids 
Stroked that cat 
Until he flipped his lid

Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Shit, and uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, but the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And niggaz do it up until the point they done and the fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting, just like some fucking lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
Doing time underground up in Marion, boy
Shit, I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy

I need me a contingency plan, my pops with the syringe in his hand

Shit, you should've seen the apartment
All I ever wanted was franks and beans I was starving
Crack fiends on the carpet, shit

I swear I'm in love with my grandma
That's why I only does it for grandma
That's when I roll in the street
I pray she covers me from the crown of my head, to the sole of my feet

Then jump in that jag, jumpsuit
Jump back from the coroner, I have you jump in that bag
Come with that cash

Killa, Jones, Freakay
Yeah man, I'm back at it

Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gon' Til' November""
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggaz, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please)
I see a town I'm likin'
See some niggas getting money in a town I like it
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like it's my block now, all right kid?
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out, ranged out the side of his right ear
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that pyrex vision
Pop, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitchin'
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm livin
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math

[Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
Tech blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before
I should y'all before, ey!

I'm on the westside of Chicago, lookin' for a bust down
And make me put my two arms up, Touchdown!
You stay in touch now, but when I tough down
I'm like Buckshot shorty, you better ""Duck Down""
Yeah I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, what now?
Birds flip a dozen, chicks is dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband
That shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'
This on my wrist is nothing
To me it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhymin'
You fucking with Pablo, Bravo, Mario Via Bolo ho, Ta-to

Stay away OK, Mr Giles'll hurt you

I ain't go to school, stayed the hell at home
In the real estate dog I seen hell at homes
You was selling out I was selling homes
Selling dreams to the phone, I can sell the tone

In the science lab I mix me chemicals
In silicone fella in the vanilla cone
The school even play the recorder
Now days he work for F-E-D-S
And plays his recorder

You think he placing he taping his order
Marking the bills they read, 
Tasting the waterf***ed up
We duct-taping his daughter
That's the taping they taught us

In addition add the eight and the quarters get it
In addition Ma, yeah you get it dog

Is to put the is in all
Furs his or hers b**** go pitch it whore

That's a real friend
That's a homie right right true

I fell that is only right
That I live the life of rally
I done did knives in alleys, pipes, in rallies
What you do now?
Now I catch flights to Cali
Looking for a wife to spouse I pipe her proudly
She understands my life gets rowdy
I'm the same say
Prane day I'm icy outey

Yo, now I done been on both sides of the fence
Now I done been on both sides of the gate 
Survived and escaped
Look at me now man I'm driving away
Thinking about my old teacher who said I rot and decay
(Never)
I go back and beep the horn at them
Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum

It all happens so fast
They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town

Yeah it's coming soldier, 
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was

You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers

Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw

G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog 
(East Side)
All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action

Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll

I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold, 
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog
I see the cops get load
Now I'm living the life I got to stop and close

Come on, yo, yo

[Verse]
Aiyoo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tuned with
The moon and the stars, some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught, pissy clubs, saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds, run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge: Cam'Ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, aiyyoo
Go get that ya-yo, ya-yo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son the lay low
Ba' bro

When I beef, names will be said tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read, cause what I deal with is usually feds

Now I'm the type of dude, post up sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties, you want it, I got it
You see it, you like it, we count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a menace to the public society
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it I'm driving, I'm puffing high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving, I'm bugging my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers for all they milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
Uh, you niggaz follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me, and still a little nigga
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done, steak and chicken, for they friends
And they kids fly, I ain't open friend, on the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes, barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam, for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people

Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour, the soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together, in the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got to fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up you know?
You already know what I'm about homie
 I'm young I'm focused I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me
You know I ain't stopping yet

I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
The shit is disguster
Underground with people, lethal, trapped in the desert, surrounded by evil
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest, by Mitchell and S.
I got her opened, hoping she's not, I'd have her crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She'd get cracked up and hit, keep soaping your cycle mami
My girls lay up in suites, a half of cake of week, and masturbate like Tweet
Killa, I be popping the oozies, copping them Coogis, eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking the rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that would merk you like Jason Williams (uh Huh)
Don't play with villas', vacate the building
Or the eights will come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram

Forty-fours, the pleading, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa wallys leading the movement, for realla we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in a tomb, just facing my time
Loyal on side, outside spoiler on rides, system bumping, bumping ?oh boy? in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit, he done came got his boy, he's ashamed at his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employed

I tell them, sincerly, it's clearly, you hearing me backwrds
I tell 'em I'm great, but still I need practice
I tell them to wait, go and comeback quick, they don't understand me
It's not logic, I'm not logic, I got problems
I worship the late prophet, the great Muhammad Ali
For the words that he spoke, that stung like a bee
Soaked into me, you niggaz will see but
I'm still insane, I'm Rodman, dealing my brain
I'm grinding sharing my pain, fuck, where is the fame
Niggaz, they still rhyming, still in the game
They still dealing the cane, still cock shit in your brain, homie
I still smell the rotten people that lay
There in ground zero, forgotten, left in for days
Probably left there to stay, left in decay
Broken pieces of towers, left in their graves
I pray they be saved, until then, that's just a suggestion I made
Follow me homie, listen, I subjected my ways nigga
Weapons that spray, at your fucking face nigga
It's Santana the great, in the place niggaz, stay away nigga
Cause I'm headed straight to the top, niggaz
Diplomat Taliban slash ROC nigga
Oh yeah, I do this for my block niggaz
D train, Al Gator, pop niggaz
Young drugs, young twins, Shiest bug
Niggaz I love, my thugs
Now, come fuck with your boy
Jones, Killa, Freakay, come fuck with your boy, WHOA
It's Santana again nigga, no bandanas just him nigga
In the flesh, like
[Cam'Ron]
I seen it time, business and friendship
Friendships ended, business attended, clips get extended
Lawyers get called, accountants get faxed
That was my man, well I wish that he meant it
It's been a long time, hereing the mobsters
This ain't overnight, it's years in the process
Shed a tear in the process, now process is over
All my niggaz get prepared for the Oscars
Back to the block, sharing a lobster
Morris Malone, Sam Malone, preparing the vodka, holla
Hallejulah, no hum-do-allah, but respecting my Aki
He held me down, when it was getting real rocky
Hustling, isn't a hobby
I sit in the lobby, look at my ovie, have visions of Gotti
Visions of lotties, pictures of Blood, scenes of L
I want to see my son, piss in that potty
Jimmy, I'm going to make sure your wrist is real rocky
See my plans are for long term like Mr. Miyagi
Wax on, wax off, put our wax on, take that wack off
Over some nights, I had fights over the white
The roads to the lows, I knows what it's like
Now, career over like Mike: anyone
Tyson, Jordan, Jackson, it's over
This shit right here touched my soul, man
My grandmother or something, 56 bless her soul
Apartment 56 that is, 101, West 140th
Rest In Peace Liddiah Giles, Blood Shed..",I Love You

Want to use my brain, than give Killa mad dough
It's all good, increase Killa cash flow
Increase my fame, that's why Killa smash hoes
You'll get side swiped, look at my life
First movie ever, merked out Mekhi Phife
And papi got jerked out of pies twice

Gave her a son like Ricky, from ?Boyz in the Hood'
On the couch bloody, old lady sighing
Wifey screaming (I really mean it)
Pissy little baby crying

Why yall know what crack sound like homie
Or what the mac sound like when it's strapped on me, please back off me
Before this mac that's strapped on me, gets snatched off me
Cocked back used to crash your homies, oh
Why yall can't fuck with me man, I guarantee man
It's Santana the rap +He-man+
Why yall skeltors get your melons torched when this weapon sart letting off
Santana no, don't hurt 'em, don't squirt 'em
Don't let the nine burn 'em in the sternum
They don't want to go to war with ya'
They ain't ready to bang or go to war with ya'
So leave 'em alone, don't feed 'em the chrome
Why yall labels'll to stop watching me
I tried to tell you before, I was ready, I was always hot property
Now look, I'm Diplomat slash ROC property
Stash rocks probably, fucker, you're not stopping me

I'm so, gangsta, it's no one just like me
Smooth thug, will Pretty Tony your wifey
So you better keep your bitch away
Cause I will get her number, call her up, make her my bitch today
Why yall can't fuck with the ""Great"" Santana, bandanna give in clips and weight
Hammers will split your face, shift your waist, to a different place
Next thing you know, I'm in a different state
Back next month, new whip, different plate
Damn, Santana delivery the raw
Delivery the four, for sure man, I did it before
So if your bitch is a whore, don't fight for her
Don't waste your life for her, trying to make it right for her
With all that frontin' your doin', and stuntin' you're doin'
I'll shoot the bump while you moving and shut you from moving

[Chorus]

[Juelz Santana]
Why yall niggas don't ride like I do
Slide through in that 7-4-5 blue, right beside who? Killer
Where Jones, in the pick-up truck
Yeah we use that to pick up stuff, pick up bucks
And my Denali is often parked, inside of my condo
How much did he sign for?
Oh, I bet you want to know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the 4-4, money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money
I'm used to that fast crack, bag crack
Re-cook bag that, give it out, half that
If it still bags, have stacks
No more running back to me, coming back to me
I'm on the corner with a hundred packs of these
Damn, oh, he got the purple

[Let's get it on, on, on] ? Fades till end",Let's Go
The Diplomats,"Yo, I try to be easy
I try to be calm breathe easy, it don't seem easy
I'm on my Ps and Qs, Ys and Zs, .45 on the side of me
Plus, four guys on the side of me, with .45 on the side of them

We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us any day now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving

Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plunger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this Nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as fuck, you're fucked if I leave ya chump

Went to school, but ain't stay in class, hated class
Only for period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games was bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at

Hop scotching on niggaz faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on my clock, clocking my work up, niggaz know me

Taught him how to cook, livin' his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this shorty
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty
Fuck with me

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
The sequel of Able, fuck with your boy

You motherfuckers really don't know
You motherfuckers really wont know
I'm real fucka, I really wont fold
I kill fuckas and wheelie off roads

Bangie rapper, like I'm really off road
The pain I feel, I really wont show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'ma make it or not

But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
Till the day I'm laid on the block, with shots in me

Stay weeded, stay cheffing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught
In my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me

So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it

This is the Matrix, I take it we live in
Shit, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'

Shoot shit, shit is poppin'
Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
The sequel of Able, fuck with your boy

Glad I got you baby
You the only one I can count on man
You may crutch man, yo

[Verse 1]
We leaves spots milt, you get your top tilt
Mop filled, my block leaves cops killed, duck shots still
You not built, you had zirconia's, those was zirconia's
I kept it spot built, I can ensemble linen
Grinin' on rock, silk, I'm hitting bitches like switches
I'm a top Wilt, that's Chamberlain, mama became a friend
Said she had the lamest men, wanted to learn the game I win
I had to game her then, you rearrange your friends
Then you change that Benz, we need a Range with Rims
She bought a gravy Rover, it had a pastry odor
Yes she made the quota, cause I'm like Ray Liotta
Fiends in a caskets, leaning them bastards
But the meanest of fabrics, when I'm with Athena Onassis
Or Ms. Trina, the queen of the asses
Causes when it come to purple, I've seen it in masses

[Cam - talking]
Whoo! Tino, you almost finished? (This ain't purple neither Tito)
This blunt almost out right here (I don't know what this is)
I love you man (I'm not smoking this)
Only thing I count on is you (Tito I want him, I don't want him)
Tito just got the blunt, (Don't fuck with nothing else but you)
I'm reloaded now, (God damn)
(Tito roll me up another blunt, something ain't right with this)

[Verse 2]
And I'm a naissance child, gaming her stupid now
Plus, I'm stupid foul, pulled a coup to trial
I come through Canal, and let the luger style
In the DA mouth shit, here's a root canal
Right on center street, put 'em on front street
Next day the front page, who gonna front on me
Girls deranked and chumped, call 'em skank and cunt
Take a trip with the Dip bitch, to the bank to stunt
Serena Williams, downtown vacant and Trump
Who want to bang her rump, chump, yes I bring the pump
That's why I'm kinda hyped, because my money's good
Which means my mind is right, so I got time to write
How I grind at night, Next tab, china white
Army hat, army jacket, yesir my line is right
Diminish his army, we finished the Don P
Now let's get purple like Grimace and Barney
Holla

[Cam - talking]
I gotta come in now, I don't know what Tito's rolling up
I gotta roll it up my self (I don't know what's in them Dutch Masters)
If you don't crush your own weed up
And put it in the blunt yourself
Your own brother'll hand you some dust
That's what time it is

Shoots from the 4-4 magnum, that's how we get back at 'em

Trap 'em, grab 'em and clap at 'em

I'm watching the heads they copping the coke y'all
And to the fiends and junkies, the broken dreams of drunkies

Hoes with low esteem, you know they scream on their monthly

And to my soldiers rocking green in the country
Keep your dean and stay hungry, let get this cream and get money

What? Is what's really good? That's the question

Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

All my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandanna, release the eight a spit

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

I like that, yeah who are you? Santana
Shit is crazy man
Why'all think niggaz don't cry? We do
Yeah, man I gotta get my thoughts together, I be thinking a lot
Light up a blunt, think of a rhyme sometimes too
But it's like yo...zone out

The time is now, my grind is here shit
My body is focused, my mind's in gear, let's start it
I'm moving at an unstoppable pace, I managed to reach the top of the race
Before it started damn, cold-hearted man
Rip apart your man, for that green dollar
Plain reppin' my target, stay and holla
Shoot and move from where ever my targets land
Damn, shit, I see ghosts when I sleep
It's really, I got to wake up, just to know I was sleep
Holding the heat, cold sweat all over my sheet
That's why I paint the most vividest pictures
My niggaz my bitches in the same position I live in
No oil and hot water, just boiling hot water
Cooking coke, to the oil and hot water, shit
But who am I

I lived the life of a loner, with a righteous persona
But still sold crack right on the corner
My life consist of, a big puzzle that's mixed up
Big bucks, big drugs, if I get caught, then it's big cuffs
Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow
As I hold this bottle and smoke this reefeer
Listening to some old Aaliyah, I say, damn...
And a tear comes trimbling down
Never seen a man cry, well you witness it now
Shit, this isn't game from the heart, this pain from the heart
This is for you Dame, it came from the heart, so

Momma, I just want you to know
I'm in love with you so, if you wasn't here I'd be in love with you soul
My angel, mommy I'd die faithful
Just knowing someone tried to violate you
I'll slide eighths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, swallow a gun
Shit, you gotta know I'm your son
Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen

Yeah, but it's more then the liquor and weed
Yeah it's more then the liquor in me
Shit, I gotta get it together
I was falling off, with drunk words and sober thoughts

Plus, four guys on the side of me, with .45 on the side of them

We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us anyday now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving

Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plugger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as f***, you're f***ed if I leave ya chump

Went to school, but ain't stay in cla**, hated cla**
Only for period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games was bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at

Hop scotching on n****z faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work, and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on my clock, clocking my work up, n****z know me

Taught him how to cook, livin his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this shorty
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty

But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
'Til the day I'm layed on the block, with shots in me

Stay weeded, stay cheifing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught in my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen

Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it
This is the Matrix, I take it we live in

S***, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'
Shoot s***, s*** is poppin'

Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!

Souped up cars on the through way, yup

And who needs history when time just moves ahead,

And she wore these tiny slippers wear you'd think her toes were squeezed,

Takes its toll.

And tend the plants
That I meant to grow.

Meant to grow.
Meant to grow.

Will the angels walk or will they fly?

Tell me what to do in seven years.
And if its not my time can I come back?

There are days when a warm look from a strange face will make me forget my name

And you wonder why you never split this beat scene when a higher life awaits
There'll be days when you don't know how you picked the wrong life

There are fights that'll hear things that we know we don't mean
And we say 'em 'cos we don't know what we both want and we can't get to the other side

There are years that'll fly like wind across a flood plain
Unaware of its own weight, free of friction, and immune to its own speed
There are weeks that'll crawl like slugs across a hot road
Only moving 'cos it just don't know how to stop on a search for god knows what
And there are songs that'll make your skull ring like a dropped cup
Resonating with the reasons why you worked through -- and the reasons why you stayed

For the long nights when you found a new resolve that I never knew was there
For the cold eye and the warm embrace now
For the righteous vibe that I need like the air I breathe

Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

It's quite a spectacle to see us land
In waste receptacles as if we've planned it
We're never skeptical when we get branded
Then disrespectful 'cause we feel abandoned

The height of mediocrity is the challenge
Crawling through the entrails of imbalance
We learn to like to be the heroes
We learn to lie to the brand name Negroes

We learn to laugh to avoid being angry
We learn to kill and learn to go hungry
We learn not to feel, for protection
And we learn to flaunt when we get an erection

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

We're born believing we're greater than circumstance
Infinitely stronger than chance as our first breath is handed
We taste the double standard, the need to wear the mask
And with society's nurturing, the psychic plastic surgery

Begins to take effect as our souls watch astound
Our characters flounder, duplicitous identity
Diction and contradiction have become the skills of assimilation
Razor honed to perfection from the moment of creation

It's gone from identity crisis to survival slingshot to rifle
Sin to revival, try to get looked at but not poked in the eyeball
Warned of our impurities, afraid of insecurities
Real life experts of the artificial, athletes and entertainers
Have become the minstrels on commercials

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

On screen or off we can be rented to perform any feat
And we reflect the images presented by the media's elite
Positive or negative attention is viewed as success
U.S.D.A. African American Beef is seen as progress

We never ask ourselves too many questions
Too much truth in introspection
Maintain the regimentation and avoid self-degradation
We act out all the stereo types, try to use them as decoy

And we become shining examples
Of the system we set out to destroy
'Cause even in the most radical groups you will find
That when you stray from the doctrine, you'll see hard times

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

Being kicked in the mouth or smiling with no teeth
They're both choices, yes, but it's impossible to eat
Uneducated, underdeveloped, undisciplined but mostly unaware
We join the flavor of the month club

We swallow the flavor of the month
Well, holding our crotch was the flavor of the month
Bitch this bitch that was the flavor of the month
Being a thug was the flavor of the month

Then no to drugs was the flavor of the month
Kangol was the flavor of the month
Rope gold was the flavor of the month
Adidas shoes was the flavor of the month

Then bashing Jews was the flavor of the month
Gentrification was the flavor of the month
Isolation was the flavor of the month

My pockets are so empty, I can feel my testicles
'Cause I spent all my money on some plastic African necklaces
And I still don't know what the colors mean
Red, black and green

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy

Somewhere in the desert
We raised the oil pressure
And waited for the weather
To get much better
For the new wind to blow in the storm
We tried to remember the history in the region
The French foreign legion, Imperialism,
Peter O'Toole and hate the Ayatollah
Were all we learned in school
Not that we gave Hussein five billion
Not of our new bed partner the Syrian
And of course no mention of the Palestine situation
It was amazing how they steamrolled
They said eighty percent approval
But there was no one that I knew polled
No one had a reason for being in the Gulf
We waited for congress to speak up illegal build up
But no one would wake up
Our representatives were Milli Vanilli's
For corporate Dallas Cowboy Beverly Hillbillies
With perfect timing
The politicians rhyming their sentiments
So nicely oil gold and sand
My sediments precisely
We regretfully support the lunacy
I'm afraid there is no time for more scrutiny
National unity preserve our community
TeflonÂ© election opportunities
Were in profundant abundance

On January second the Bush administration
Announced a recession had stricken
The Nation the highest quarterly
Earnings in ten years were posted
By Chevron
Meanwhile a budget was placed in our hands
As the deadline in the sand came to an end
So much for the peace dividend
One billion a day is what we spent
And our grandchildren will pay for it 'til the end
When schools are unfunded
And kids don't get their diplomas
They get used for gun boat diplomacy
Disproportionately
Black or brown we see
Bullet catchers for the slave master

Then the conservatives called up reservists
To active service left families nervous
But more importantly broke nine hundred a month
But the check came late, army red tape you see,
This golden opportunity
We watched the tube and read the newspaper
The propaganda of the gas masked raper
Was the proper slander to whip up the hatred

The stage was lit and the lights were all faded
The pilots in night vision goggles Kuwaited and
Generals masturbated
'til the fifteenth two days later they invaded
Not a single t.v. station expressed dissension or
Hardly made mention to the censorship of information
From our kinder and gentler nation
Blinder and mentaler retardation
Disorientation
The pilots said their bombs lit Baghdad
Like a Christmas tree
It was the Christian thing to do you see
They didn't mention any casualties
No distinction between the real
And the proxy
Only football analogies

We saw the bomb hole
We watched the Super Bowl
We saw the scud missile
We watched BudÂ© commercials
We saw the yellow ribbons
Saw pilots in prison
We never saw films of the dead at eleven
Angela Davis addressed the spectators
And shouting above a rumbling generator said
If they insist on bringing us down
Then let's shut the whole country down
Marching through the downtown
A hundred thousand became participants
And we heard the drums of millions off in the distance
Rushing through the cities
Some of them did things that weren't so pretty
Most were there for primal scream therapy
News men concentrated
On the negative liked the jingoists more
Peaceful protesters ended up
On the cutting room floor
NintendoÂ© casualties of the ratings war
More bombs dropped than in World War II
On in both Asian invasions, new world order persuasion,
Business as usual
For our nation
Could you imagine a hundred fifty thousand dead,
The city of Stockton
Coffins locked in when we clocked in...not to mention
Civilians
The loss of life on both sides
Pushed the limits of resilience
The scent of blood in our nostrils
Fuel of the fossil land of apostle
The blackness that covered the sky was not the only thing
That brought a tear to the eye or
The taste of anger to the tongues
Of those too young to remember Vietnam

Is heroin better in a veteran's mind
Than the memory of the dying laying in a line
Is it the smell or the shadows heaving and weeping
That keeps the soldier from sleeping
As he sings the orphan's lullaby
When the soldiers put down their bayonets
The strings are chained to the marionettes
Emir of Kuwait gets back in his jet
We replace the dead with new cadets
Will we hate those who did the shelling
Or will we hate those who weren't willing to do the killing
When the leaders of the bald eagles come home to roost
Will we sing a song of praise and indebtedness
For our deliverance from evil
Or will we sing a song of sadness
For the dreaded debt this mess delivered us PEOPLE.",The Winter of the Long Hot Summer

The wheel that turns us all comes to a sudden stop.
The wind that's blown us dies a quick and painless death
The air gets clammy and we hold each other's breath
We get the feeling that we're not alone in this
And then a God who really ought not to exist
Sticks out a great big hand
And grabs me by the wrist
And asks me ""why?"" and I say
""Well God, it's like this
It may be arrogance
Or just appalling taste
But I'd rather use my pain than let it all go to waste
On some old god who tells me what I want to hear
As if I cannot tell obedience from fear
I want to take my pleasures where and how I will,
Be they disgraceful or distasteful or distilled
And to be frank I find that life has more appeal
Without a driver who's asleep behind the wheel""

The rain has started falling,
Gradually gathering in strength;
What began a drizzle
Has now become torrential,
And doesn't look like coming to an end.

The two bedraggled figures
That huddle in the doorway,
With nothing vaguely waterproof to wear,
Are now secretly wishing
They'd listened to their mothers
When being told to always be prepared.

Screaming
'Geronimo!',
They run for it down the road;
With an arm around her waist
He leads her to a place
He knows.

Soaked through, but happy,
They squelch up to the landing;
The room before them
Makes a welcome sight.
The coal fire is throwing
Strange shapes upon the hearthrug,
And crying out to be knelt down beside.

She pulls off her jumper
And flings it in the corner;
He picks it up and hangs it on a chair.
She puts on a record
And sings into her coffee;
He puts a blanket round her,
Sits her down
And dries her beautiful hair.",Geronimo

And now, with wheels spinning free
He's picking up speed

They withdraw to the drawing room
Where the Schubert she plays with style
Keeps her friends happy for the while

But the memories are a burden,
So she draws back both the curtains
Stepping out into the night

As the glow from the house recedes
And their voices blend with the breeze
She is free to be who she will
Free to skip barefoot down the hill

Maybe she is Neptune's daughter
For she's drawn towards the water
Stepping out into the night

The water cold against her skin
Conceals a multitude of sins
And laughing like a little girl
She enters an enchanted world

Where seaweed girls with silver tails
Play games upon the backs of whales
They want her to come home with them
They grab her legs and drag her

Down again, down again

And takes her in his arms
And he carries her back to shore",Neptunes Daughter

I'd go all the way

And you would not cry,
'Cause trees don't cry

If you were a man
I would still love you

I'd drink my fill of you

If you were attacked
I would kill for you
If your name was Jack
I'd change mine to Jill for you

If you were a horse
I'd clean the crap out of your stable
And never once complain
If you were a horse

I could ride you through the fields at dawn
Through the day until the day was gone
I could sing about you in my songs
As we rode away into the setting sun

If you were my little girl
I would find it hard to let you go
If you were my sister
I would find it doubly so

If you were a dog
I'd feed you scraps from off the table
Though my wife complains
If you were my dog

I am sure you'd like it better
Then you'd be my loyal four legged friend
You'd never have to think again
And we could be together till the end",If...

The Divine Comedy,"I laid all my songs at Johnny Mathis' Feet

On a house without love, doors or windows

And with a wave of his jewel-encrusted hand
Across a glittering Las Vegas scene,
He said: ""You've got to learn how to disappear
In the silk and amphetamines.""

Johnny looked at my songs, and he said
""Well, at first guess,
Never in my life have I ever seen such a mess;
Why do you say everything as if you were a thief?
Like what you stole has no value,
And like what you preach is far from belief?""

And with a wave of his red, and blue hand
Across a glittering Hollywood scene,
He said, ""You've got to learn how to disappear

Anonymous scenes of disaffection, chaos and torture
And he said, ""You are on the right track,

Beside an English fire.

And thine too is the last green field
That Lucy's eye surveyed.

Beside the springs of Dove,

And very few to love:

Half hidden from the eye
Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.

When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave and, oh
The difference to me

A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears.

The touch of earthly eyes.

When there's no more lies to hide behind 
And no more tears to cry 
I know we'll be alright 
'Cause even though the skies above are cold and grey 
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day 

I found some letters from a happier time 
I smelled the scented pages and re-read the lines 
Why must the summer always turn into the fall? 
Why must we lose love to ever know love at all? 

When there's no more lies to hide behind 
And no more tears to cry 
I know we'll be alright 
'Cause even though the skies above are cold and gray 
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day

The Divine Comedy,"I packed up my suitcase and left the old farm 
I promised my papa I'd come to no harm 
And I went to the city where I was employed 
In a firm of accountants as an office boy. 

I fetched and I carried, I watched and I learned 
And slowly but surely I rose through the firm. 
But then I discovered my colleagues one day 
Massaging the figures for personal gain 
I said ""I'll not wallow in this house of shame"" 
I'll plough my own furrow, I'll go my own way. 

Gravely I listened to Reverend McBride 
Down at the mission house each Friday night. 
Heaven's salvation for those who know best, 
Hell and damnation for all of the rest. 

Try as I might I could not understand 
Why The Almighty's all-merciful hand 
Should cast away those whose only mistake 
Was never to know the Christian faith 
The stars that we follow can lead us astray 

I'll plough my own furrow, I'll go my own way 

I fled from the capitals bourgeois malaise 
And trekked through the wilderness for fourteen days 
'Til I found the guerrillas camped high in the hills 
I asked Comrade Diaz whom I should kill. 

I crept into town with a knife in my teeth 
And entered the home of the Chief of Police 
I stood at his bedside and raised up my blade 
But then I looked to the crib where his little one lay 
You murder tomorrow by killing today

Out of the studio sky-light 
Watching the ash as it rolls down the roof 
Leaving a trail of grey-white 

All through its short life it gives of itself 
Giving and giving and slowly diminishing 
Until there isn't a crumb of it left 
It no longer is, it's a snowball in negative 

Wandering home along Marlborough Road 
I realize in amazement 
That I have been, for how long I don't know, 
Avoiding the cracks in the pavement

Since the eighth of November

What you'd do on my birthday
Well hooray it's my birthday!
And frankly, baby, I can't wait.

I don't want to die a virgin

The other day I discovered
A magazine of my brother's
I read it under the covers
It got me all hot and bothered.

You don't know how much I need you

And through the arcade
Past the antique shops
Of Regent's Parade
To an innocuous London address
A quick glance around, and then down the wet steps

God only knows what keeps bringing me here
Gambling with everything that I hold dear
One careless word, in establishment ears
And bang goes the knighthood, the wife and career

You make me feel, you make me feel something
And feeling something, beats feeling nothing at all
And nothing at all is what I feel

I know it's coming
The fear is making me ill
But then, the fear
Is part of the thrill

The consequences of breaking the rules
They said ""we're just being cruel to be kind""

Why do you look so glum, was it something I did?

We'll crunch the numbers, 'cause the numbers never lie

We can build a much much bigger bubble the next time

The Dixieland Ramblers,"Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
I miss it, each night and day
The longer I stay away
Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mocking birds use to sing
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi
Are hurrying to spring
The mardy grass memories
Of creol tunes that fill the air
I dream of Orleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there

And there is something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I want the days to come, I want these sleepless nights to end
I lie here thinking how I lost you to all your stupid friends
You made me feel so foolish for the twenty-second time
Your love might be the last time that I try

Don't know if I'll make it through this winter without you on my own
I waited here for you forever, I can't believe you'd go
I may not have the answers, but I'd rather never know
Your love was such a heavy, heavy blow

Goodnight my love, you seemed so nice 'til I knew you better
Now I can tell you're always thinking twice about what might be better

You don't try, you just lie there hoping that someone will come to make it right

Don't try and hide it, don't try to hide it fight it

And what the hell were you putting your faith in?
Something you could not, someone you look too
And now you watch it, always floating over
What you would long for, what you were born to

Don't memorize all of your locations
You are nowhere, you are nothing vacant
Don't give your eyes to other's vocations
They will only keep you in your station

Don't try and hide it, don't try and fight it
Don't try and hide it, don't try to hide it fight it",Don't Try and Hide It
The Dodos,"This takes us by surprise I'm sure
Are you the curse? are you the cure?
Sometimes you know you ask too much
Been getting good at giving up

This ship is going under, going under, going under

Cast off, but hit the ocean floor
Misguided thread, he'll want your pores
I see you there upon a bluff
You disappear a tiny dot

This ship is going under, going under, going under

Misplace my heart, misplace my hope
I'm here without it
Contained at home to all the brave
And bold who found it

To know you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
I hope you will, doing it once, I know you will, I've only begun

Give all my things, to all my enemy's are grounded
I make amends, I gave it up, I hope you found it
I see you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
To all of them, doing it once, I hope you know, I've only begun

Oh

To all the gold, my hands are up, I hide my plunder
Goodbye to everyone I know, were going under
I see you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
To all of them, doing it once, I hope you know, I've only begun

Oh",Going Under
The Dodos,"In my head, it's all been laughter;
In my head, it's all been laughter;
In my head, it's all been laughter!

Could you be certain?
What you've been searching?
Won't be late

What you've been hoping
Could leave you broken
Don't be late

Cause even when your cries stop
They belong to break in two
Cause even when your cries stop

In my head, it's all I'm after;
In my head, it's all I'm after;
In my head, it's all I'm after!

Could you be certain?
What you've been searching?
Won't be late

What you've been hoping
Could leave you broken
Don't be late

Cause even when your cries stop
They belong to break in two
Cause even when your cries stop

Wouldn't cut you off or even if I could
Confiscate your love or leave it when I should
You got a big heart maybe start thinking return
Is it better to be on or be good?

Couldn't cast you off or nobody's that good
Confiscate your love or leave it when I should
You got a big heart maybe start thinking return
Is it better to be on or be good?

The Dodos,"I know you and I can't believe you;
When you say you give, when given to.
I called you in, I know you won't be
Offering your care and making me;
I need you and you know I'm only
Cautioned to the wind when it's blowing.
I called you in, I know you won't be
Offering your care get me out of here soon

I'll be heading out, hunting season here soon,
You go be a girl, I'll go searching for food,
You take care of him, I'll take care of;
You take care of him, I'll take care of..

I know you did your talking with me

I know you when, I let you get me,

Listening to the wind; when I'm leaving.
I give to you, I don't know what
It's going to take me to get you out of my sight

You go be a girl I'll be leaving tonight
You take care of him, I take care of;
You take care of him, I take care of..

The Dogs,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

When you woke up
Or got choked up

See the way you can't sit still
With no mention
But attention
For a dead flower

So I write, write, write
All the things I didn't miss
And despite, spite, spite
My conclusion is

Nobody wants u
Nobody wants u
Like I do

It must be what you said
Just the wrong time
To be laughing
What goes through that head

And you won't just act your age
So you dance it
Too romantic
Put me on display

Excuses, abuses
You've used me up
My patience can't take it
I've had enough

It must be meant to be
When you make up
From the breakup
So now I see

It must be how you looked
When you woke up
Right here next to me

I made a list, you found it
And you left and said we're through
So I'm here outside your window
In the dark and calling you

It opens, hear you breathing
My fingers through your hair
Tell me I do

I already met your mom and dad
Said I'm the best one you never had
And I think you should really reconsider
It won't be misunderstood
It won't do you any good
Think I'm not the one you could
But I know that you would
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
(Don't want me, no)
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
I watched you through the window last night
And I thought I saw a girl in the candlelight
You think that's fair after all I've done?
Restraining orders one by one
And I sure hope that was your sister
I guess you misunderstood
Didn't do you any good
That you thought I never could
Now you know that I would
Now you know that I would
Now you know that I Would

The Donnas,"Oh you've got lights they burn out for you
And you've got eyes, cocaine
white and blue
All you know is wine and good friends
Cos luck like yours, it never ends

Or did you think it'd last forever?

Is that it, is that all you got for me?
Justa copy of a copy
I won't let you have it for free free free

A pick me up and then you're off again
The crowd's there to see if you'll sink or swim
They laugh and cheer
when you crash and burn
But they'll be back for your big return
(they'll never learn)

Watch the smoke fade,
you finally got your space
Wander the streets, but
no one knows your face

So give it up down to the top

You dont know what you're talkin' about
It's about time somebody called you out
Tell me Am I speaking English, 
Or is this just a death wish?

The less you talk, the more you say

When your holdin' it all alone
And you've been workin' it to the bone
It's so hard, it's so hard

And every little thread is wearing thin
I've been livin' life in the slow lane

Right now opposites subtract
And I don't know if I can bridge the gap

The phone bills, and missed calls, have
got us they've got us

At the mercy of a mile
In no place to make demands
I'll make it worth your while
But right now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

Ode to sleep pillows and sheets
The last place I'd expect us to meet

You'd never do it, even though you blew it
Deep down you knew it but you hid it
I guess I just beat you to it

And we be kissin'
And I be thinkin' about what was missin'
We didn't fight
We just passed like ships in the night

I'm all done with you now
I'm all done with you now

You wanted me to hold your hand
But you were gone so you can hold your own
Now your living out the life we planed
With some Hippie girl you know

I couldn’t wait
I wanted you, but you wanted to hibernate
I couldn’t stand it
So I made out like a bandit

Shouldn't have gotten so comfortable
Made it so much harder when I had to go
It's okay because now I know
That you can't hold mine, if you can't hold your own

I can't believe, I had to leave
And take my heart off my sleeve
