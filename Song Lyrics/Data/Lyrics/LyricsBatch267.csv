Leslie West,"Some women make me weak in the knees
When I'm near you I start to sneeze
Went to the Doctor told him what I got
Threw up his hands and he gave me a shot

I'm allergic
I'm allergic to your touch
I'm allergic baby
Don't get me wrong I like you too much

You're easy on the eyes it's plain to see
Only from a distance don't get near me
When you first come up to me I fell so alive
Next thing I know I'm breaking out in hives

I'm allergic
I'm allergic to your touch
I'm allergic baby
Don't get me wrong woman I like you too much

I've tried everything from thyme to jungle root

But I break out when I get next to you

It's like you press the button on my remote
I get a little scratchy in my throat
My eyes start to water and I feel like cryin
It sounds unlikely but I ain't lyin'

I'm allergic
I'm allergic to your touch (to your touch)
I'm allergic baby
Don't get me wrong woman I like you too much

I'm allergic, allergic baby
I'm allergic to your touch
I'm allergic baby I'm allergic
Don't get me wrong woman I like you too much

I'm allergic
I'm allergic baby",Allergic
Leslie West,"I got some satisfaction from lifting up your dress
A slap in the face is worth a hundred words.
When I open my eyes again I expect that you'll be gone,
But you always do what I expect. 

I'm stopping everything, making fun of myself,
Drinking lipstick, tipping bookshelves,
Ripping up words that I thought were important
Maybe that'll blow the window open.

Everything I say is a stupid lie.
I won't tell the truth even when I die.
I'll pick myself to pieces 'til the end of time,
Then I'll glue them back together in a stupid rhyme, yeah yeah. 

There's a story of a girl so sleepy, she could not be roused.
She was kissed by pigs and doctors all over the land.
The birds in the trees came down and landed in her hair.
They built a nest and the little birdies hatched it there. 

Teach me something, rip out my hair,
Send me flying through the air.
Do something why don't you, fuck it, do something,
I'm so bored I sleep...

Why don't you go out and talk some shit,
Stand up kick 'em all in the family jewels.
We'll watch them as their guts unfold,
Then we'll rob a 7-11 and hit the road. 

I can be quiet or I can be loud,
Anything to make my daddy proud. 

We'll take hostages make demands,
Set fire to all our best laid plans.
We'll assemble volatile explosive devices,
Sell them for exorbitant prices.
Purchase an aircraft learn to fly,
Run out of gas while we're in the sky.
Automatic pilot and x-ray spex,
We were kissing in the cockpit when the airplane wrecked. 

Everything I say is a stupid lie.
I won't tell the truth even when I die.
I'll pick myself to pieces 'til the end of time,
Then I'll glue them back together in a stupid rhyme, yeah yeah.",Dragon Lady
Leslie West,"The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door",The Sky Is Crying
Leslie West,"I wish you could see me 
All broken down this way
But even if you saw me baby
I know, I could not make you stay,
I couldn't make you stay
You know about the high cost of living, 
And some-day you're gonna have to pay some-day you're gonna have to pay

Now a woman like you needs fine things 
And I knew that from the start
And I don't have much to offer
Just this old broken heart, yeah just this broken heart

And if heartaches were nickles, 
I would not be here crying in the dark
Yes if wine and pills were hundred dollar bills 
I might keep you satisfied
If broken dreams were limo sines I might take you for a ride

It's all I can do, to think of you 
And wish you were here by my side
Oh if heartaches were nickles I'd be the richest fool alive
The richest fool alive

Yes if wine and pills were hundred dollar bills 
I might keep you satisfied
If broken dreams were limousines I might take you for a ride

Leslie West,"Baby's good to me, you know,
She's happy as can be, you know,

I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know,
She tells me all the time, you know,
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

Leslie West,"Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

You thought I was a whiner
I'd forgotten where to go
I had no place to lay my head to rest
I had to go

Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

Whoah
Had to change my mind
You're going to change my mind 
Now I'm working all day long
I'm singing for my food
Baby, you know that I've got everything I need

I've given all I can
The rest belongs to me
Fact was it didn't matter
Just who I had to be

Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

Whoah
Had to change my mind
You're going to change my mind

I'm gunnin' right on through the town
Don't need you anymore
Now I think I'll turn my back and walk away from you

We're livin' in the country
Doing everything we please
I don't want you comin' round swirling up a be

Don't look around

Leslie West,"Goodbye, little Robin-Marie
Don't try following me
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause you know I'm coming home soon

My ships' leaving on a three-year tour
The next tide will take us from shore
Windlaced, gather in sail and spray
On a search for the mighty sperm whale

Fly your willow branches
Wrap your body round my soul
Lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
There are years behind us reaching
To the place where hearts are beating
And I know you're the last true love I'll ever meet

Starbuck's sharpening his harpoon
The black man's playing his tune
An old salt's sleeping his watch away
He'll be drunk again before noon

Three years sailing on bended knee
We found no whales in the sea
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause we'll be in sight of land soon",Nantucket Sleighride
Leslie West,"If you were the ocean and I was the sun 
The day made me heavy and gravity won 
I was the red and you were the blue 
I could just fade into you 

If you were a window and I was the rain 
I'd pour myself out and wash off the pain 
I'd fall like a tear so your light could shine through 
Then I'd just fade into you 

In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
'Til there's no way to know where you end and where I begin 
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed. 

If I was a shadow and you were a street 
The cobblestone midnight is where we first meet 
'Til the lights flickered out, we dance with the moon
Then I'd just fade into you 

If I was just ashes and you were the ground 
And under your willow they laid me down 
There'll be no trace that one was once two 
After I fade into you 

In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
'Til there's no way to know where you end and where I begin
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed",Fade into You
Leslie West,"Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul

Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Every thing's a fightin' about the spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?

Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Every thing's a fightin' about the spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon

Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty five
Saved you from another man

Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies
Every thing's a fightin' about it

Every thing's a cryin' about it
Every thing's a, everything's a dyin' about it
Every thing's a cryin' about it
Every thing's a lyin' about it

Everybody's a dyin' about it
Alright just tryin' about it

Less,"I am like a rat in a trap
Don't you fucking get near me
I will bite your hand if you reach
Towards me you can't help me now
I don't know who you are but I
Have these beautiful sharp teeth
I will chew my leg off just to
Put a stop to this fucking pain

I am like a clown down your street
Dancing keeping you happy
I can distract you amuse you
Keep you occupied but
You can't see my face under paint
You don't know what I'm feeling
I am walking off I'm leaving
I'm getting out of this parade

It's over

I am like a lie in my room
Counting and pacing the walls
I know how many bricks there are
Stacked up like burning witches

Escape when they die

Waiting for the day when I say

Less than Jake,"There was a kid so low, he couldn't stand up
No money, no respect and too much bad luck
Desperation had gotten to him at last
It was dark

Dark alley and a shot gun blast
And I knew a man everyone thought
Was out of his mind
He had a cane and seemed to be around all the time

And it's a shame, when a car rolls past
It was dark
Dark alley and a shot gun blast
Shotgun - no one ever thinks about it
Until your out of your head",Shotgun
Less than Jake,"If only my problems were like water
They could be boiled away
And watching the steam drift upward,
Watching my problems drift away.
And watch the steam turn and twist,
Watch it all drift away.

Look how it rises and lifts
Watch my problems drift away.
If only my problems were like water
They all could be washed away
And watch the water go downward
Watch it all go down the drain.",Black Coffee
Less than Jake,"So here let's talk about the boomtown facts
You've got stick up kids coming right at my back
Two blocks of reasonable rent and it's only getting smaller
And the rest of boomtown is only getting taller
You've got ten miles of traffic and three hundred miles of roadway
And a million lights burning bright night and day
With all these lights going off like roman candles
It's getting too much for me to handle
Boomtown's only based on image torn down and built up from one man's Vision
When all the workers are all up and gone
It feels like I'm sitting on a ticking time bomb.",Boomtown
Less than Jake,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

And then suddenly appeared before me, the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold - oh oh oh

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Summer loving happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days drifting away to oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car

She swam by me she got a cramp
He swam by me got my suit damp
I saved her life she nearly drown
He showed off splashing around

Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out till ten o'clock
Summer fling don't mean a thing but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly holding my hand
She got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eightteen
Well she was good you know what I mean
Summer heat boy and girl meet but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder that's where it ends

Less than Jake,"I think, I think I know it all,
But can I be sure of the things I've grown to know,
And can I say I know it all,
When rules just guide me to blindly follow
And things are automatic when you see them everyday
Is it the same routine
Or my fucked up dreams,
That keep me walking mindless all the way?

And was there something wrong in what I heard,
For every hour of the day?",Automatic

Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

Slow motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snap shot and it froze without a sound

Underneath polluted skies
I walked alone in those Jersey nights
And I
Saw the board walk start to fall
The empty ness starts to drown
The quiet corners of this town tonight

Late last night I made my plans
It was the only thing I felt I could do
Said goodbye to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth

It's gonna kill me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face
All of my past mistakes
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life

This is my all time low
Somehow it feels so familiar
Somehow it seems so familiar
I fell like letting go
And every second that goes by
I'm screaming out for second tries

Said goodbye to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth

It's gonna kill me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face
All of my past mistakes
I've got to live with them the rest of my life

This is the mess I've made
These are the words I can't erase
This is my life support
Shutting down
For the final time
And it swings like a blade?
And kills me for the rest of my life

If you won't forgive me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive

Less than Jake,"I have this feeling inside
That I wouldn't like me if I met me

You, you don't see me that way, you hear the words that I say
You just tell me my heart's in the right place
It's the world that's confused
And it's never too late to save a hopeless case

I've always known a ghost like me
Can disappear in a moment
Well, I'm my own worst casualty

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

Lester Bowie,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last",Save the Best for Last
Lester Bowie,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all,

Lester Flatt,"There's a happy childhood home in my memory I can see

Standing out upon the hill 'neath the shadow of the tree

If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill

Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill.



Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill

Just to be with those I love joy my heart would over fill

You're always in my heart and on my mind
Once I thought my love would die darling here's what I find
You're always in my heart and on my mind

Seems I miss you most of all when the twilight shadows fall
What a fool I was to ever let you go
If longing for you now could only bring you back somehow
You'd be here in these loving arms I know ",On My Mind

And mary you a sweet little wife""

They'd dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered ""Do-si-do""
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go

Late in the evenin' about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Well Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lordy, how it would ring?
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

He played an old piece, he called ""Soldier's Joy""
And the one he called ""Boston Boy""
The greatest of all was ""Jenny Lynn""
To me that's where fidd'lin' began

Late in the evenin' about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Well Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lordy, how it would ring?
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

Late in the evenin' about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Well Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lordy, how it would ring?

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

Too hot to handle

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town

Stars were peek-a-booing down

Because we're far apart

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

When you are far away from me

Lester Young,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Lester Young,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Stars were peek-a-booing down

""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?
Lester Young,"Count every star in the midnight sky 
Count every rose, every firefly

Heaven knows I miss you 

Count every leaf on a willow tree
Count every wave on a stormy sea
Count every star and darling when you do 
You'll know the times I have cried for you

Lester Young,"I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Lester Young,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Recordings: Clarinet Dates
Lester Young,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

Little mats, big ambition
Far from don and go on mission

Used to get my in little altercations

Well I have to swallow pride until I'm sick
We're here to fulfill every one of your dreams
A small nominal fee
It only costs you your soul

They say the older the bullshit, the more offensive the horn
It's another trick, another matador
(I don't want to be that)
If you can take that, then you can fake that
Until you grow a new mouth to say
""I hate the ones that you adore""

Swallow pride until you feel sick
My stomach hates that, hates the bitter taste of the truth
Well I swallowed pride until I felt sick
Bulimia tastes better when you swallow the truth

If you're equating fame to religion, then where's your faith at?
Go ahead and sell yourself when in rome
(Now I finally see that)
You can make it- nah, but you can fake it
Although that skin is uncomfortable
I'd rather show some skin than bear my soul
I am the man that existed the year that hell got cold
Now that I'm mature enough to feel devil's touch
We're going to fuck until we're numb

How you like me now?

A leap of faith with a foot on the ground to wait for you

It’s a crying shame we can’t afford the rent
I’ll stay home where the heart is

You’ll stay out with the hardest piece of him

But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
You're not changing and I know that you love me but 
This thing ain't going the way I planned 
Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
As bad as I want you to stay 
We can't keep going on this way 
Going this way 

Don't think you're doing me no favors 
Feeling the need to get on one knee 
When you know you ain't right baby 
You wanna make sure I'm always around 
And with the ring on my finger 
That means I'm on right now 
I see it in your eyes you weren't 
There's a good chance you doing some dirt 
Cause I don't wanna be the one 
To make you do something you don't want to 
I'm gonna let you do you 

Sometimes we want things

You tend to look over the obvious 
As bad as I want you to stay 
We can't keep going on this way

See there's a part of me 
That doesn't want you here with me 
That's a part of me 
That wants to stick right with you 
But it seems like you don't wanna put up a fight 
And why should I even try?

LeToya,"I use to love this song when I was comin' up

With your heart and I hear every word you say
When you cry at night I'll wipe your tears away
In the name of my lord I'll be there right away

I'm so glad to be here
I thank God everyday for this opportunity
Just to be able to get up there every mornin'
And I'd never take that for granted
He's blessed me for so many things
A wonderful family, friends
I thank God for listenin', let me pour my heart out for y'all
I thank those who stuck by me for anything I went through
Y'all don't know how much that mean to me man

But that's better if I show ya.

I met her like a month ago, South Beach bungalow
We rollin' in that white thang, I'm rolling up one of those
She lookin' like my wife thang, boy I need one of those
Girl it's not a slice thang, ask bout me runnin'
My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind
But when I got you in my lap, we be far from killing time
And they say that opposites attract, but we both on our grind
I love to touch you from the back, tell whats up and never mind

To ease my mind this time I won't even break down and cry,
I had good reason for leaving you I was never enough for you,
You had me down in myself, putting me down,

Now who would've thought that someone so independent,
Would become so damn submissive,
And sometimes in the back of my mind I'd be missing you, missing you,
But I can get through this cause I can do better, so much better,
So I stare at your picture for the last time,

Nar it ain't enough listen
You got me up all night up all day
Tryna figure out what I gotta to say
I can tell you this the hard or the easy way
Tryna tell you that I don't really want babe
I don't need the stress or need the drama
U cud Save the bullshit for ur mum
I now it hard to deal but listen it's the truth
What you rather dis or me straight lying to you
See now we gotta work on ur acceptance dear
Listen you shud just accept dis here
I move on
Took away love I took away you now I took away us yo

Tell me its mine
Where did you take me

Is nothing on you

Could ever be that true
So you decide

And then about what you've done
And I'll think about your other girls
And how I want to be the only one

Make a plan
And figure out where you stand
And see it through
Just make your move

His mind would rather fly beyond the classroom cage

He can take the teacher's voice
Turn it into music from another place

Hanging on to every word the teacher says

Day and night, we will be touched
Standing in the light, don't shadow the genius

So out of school he walks alone
Soon his thoughts are flowing like a golden stream
An empty house he calls his own
This place becomes a temple to a silent dream

Sometimes he will clap and sing
Then deep in meditation he will learn to be
And only birds upon the wing
With upward fascination claim to be so free

Day and night, we will be touched
Standing in the light, don't shadow the genius

Your smile, your freedom
Comes to you from within
Still a child with a reason
You're afraid but it's time to begin

Blow the wind of change
Though the words are strange to hear
Say what's on your mind
Now is not the time for fear

Sunlight through a window falls across the page

Pressed against the telescope of dreams

Spinning madly on lines defined
By each others gravity.

And by the time we see
The light of memory
There is no hope
There's no hope

Played at the speed of light

But I don't like to rearrange your lies (your lies)
So cry alone

Oh baby baby don't give up on me
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up I'm begging please
Oh baby baby this I guarantee
Turn it up, turn it up it'll be alright

Love's a special thing
Lovers only need honesty
Two hearts the same (two hearts the same)
Beating in the name of romance
And I don't care who gives in
'cause it's only a game
The end is just the same
And what remains is why you're crying alone
So alone

Oh baby baby don't give up on me
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up I'm begging please
Oh baby baby this I guarantee
Turn it up, turn it up, it'll be alright
Turn it up, turn it up, it'll be alright
Turn it up, turn it up, it'll be alright

Hope it will last but time pushes on - pullling you, pulling me

So you're on the phone trying to conjure up your past

And I wonder if it's true
Is the world a different place for me and you

You were wrong to believe she could set you free 
You're trapped by the trappings, of success 
And you know the she'll never let you be 
'Til the world knows the secrets, you confessed 

(You said)
I see her cruel face 
My heart is nothing but an empty space 
And on this sad day 
I would gladly give it all away 
In exchange 
For a floating life

As the day begins to break 

They're gonna shoot you down in flames 
When that girl starts naming names 
There's nowhere to hide from your shame",A Floating Life

On Baker Street
The limousine stood blacker than the darkest thing
In the rain
Deep in the back
His life was ending
Still they would not let him be
Where is he?

His music ran through the streets of the city
Straight to the heart with each song
The path he chose was a road to freedom
And I kept following on
My hero...

I heard the news
All my emotions shattered into empty blue
Where are you
The radio like distant thunder raging black rock symphonies
Storm heart tears

His music runs through the heart of the city
His sound is heard in each song
You never found where his road was leading
The hope you gave lingers on
My hero...

The brightest stars explode into a thousand moons

His name remains part of my emotions

He knew no matter what the breaks
We'd make the same mistakes
Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

On the backseat of the car
With Joseph and Emily

'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes
Take me back into your arms
It's no longer a mystery
There's no cause for alarm
Could have never come this far
With no sense of history
It always leaves a scar

Levi Riggs,"Born twenty miles outside of town, up a road only trucks and tractor's go down.
Two bare feet's how you got around, growin up a down home boy.
Ate what we planted in the ol red clay, sun burned from workin' in the field a day.
You use what you learn in the FFA, growing up a down home boy.

[Chorus]
Down home boys have roots that don't break loose
And pull up in the first hard rain.
They got grandma's bible,
Grandpa's rifle and well water in their veins.
Could a cut my first tooth on a silver spoon.
Thank God I had no choice
But to grow a little backbone, growin' up a down home boy.

Pull your rusty bucket in that four year school,
Your Co-Op cap and your boots ain't cool.

The frat daddy's all make fun of you for growing up a down home boy.
But between that football scholarship and datin' that sorority president
And that degree you proved it don't hurt a bit, growing up a down home boy.

[Chorus]

You buy 15 acres off your old man. Have a little baby just a quick as you can.
Then you and your woman get to try your hand at growin' up a down home boy.

[Chorus]

Could-a cut his first tooth on a silver spoon.
Thank God he's got no choice

But to grow a little backbone, growing up a down home,
Grow a little backbone growing up a down home boy, growing up a down home boy!",Down Home Boy

The rail bed was frozen with ice
In the distance an engine was keepin' good time
The steam whistle moaned just twice
Down in the cut past the old trestle bridge
Twelve fine horses stood
Masked men shivered in the cold on the ridge
Not far from the Glendale woods

The brass lamp shone from the swayin' train
When the driver saw the red light
Her iron brakes sparked like silver rain
And the metals screamed through the night
The baggage man peered out to look for the fault
When fear froze up his heart
He was starin' down the barrel of an army colt
That threatened to tear him apart

Open up your damned express car and jump down to the ground

They ain't offered no reward for Frank and Jesse James
Frank and Jesse James

In long soldiers coats frayed with years
Quickly they scrambled aboard
The men was a-sweatin' and the women shed tears
And a preacher prayed to the Lord
When they opened the safe there was nothing for them
So they strolled down through the train
What a miserable sight, these desperate men
Robbin' old folks for their gold watch chains

Some say his spirit survived
But we all know he was nothin' but a Missouri farm boy

Levon Helm,"There's a sorrow in the wind
Blowing down the road I've been
I can hear it cry while shadows steal the sun

But I cannot look back now
I've come too far to turn around
And there's still a race ahead that I must run

I'm only halfway home, I've gotta journey on
To where I'll find, find the things I have lost
I've come a long long road but still I've got some miles to go
I've got a wide, a wide river to cross

I have stumbled, I have strayed
You can trace the tracks I made
All across the memories my heart recalls
But I'm still a refugee, won't you say a prayer for me?
'Cause sometimes even the strongest soldier falls

I'm only halfway home, I've gotta journey on
To where I'll find, I'll find the things I have lost

Night now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands""

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long

As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

Delightful to know and heaven to kiss.

Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say.

Lew Tabackin,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Put their slippers on

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone

Lewis Watson,"I'm leaving you
Not sure if that's what I should do
It hurts so bad
I'm wanting you but can't go back

Trying for find, find
That, oh, illusive piece of mind
Stuck here, somehow
Shrouded beneath my fear
And I, I don't need it

I'm walking down this world alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

And my head is in a cloud of rain
And the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets
The drops

So you left a mark
And I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best

When I'm with you
And everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret
And I don't need it

'Cause I'm wondering down this road alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

And when you're not around, I'm hardly myself
You had to leave just like everyone else
I'll get on my knees

Taking shortcuts away from it all
Where am I heading? I'm still unsure
You said you'd catch me, or at least break my fall
But now you're gone, oh

Now I'm sat here, taking the blame
Maybe if I had said something different, 
Your mind would've changed
I couldn't have been more wrong, 
Because you left as soon as you came
You left as soon as you came

Close my eyes, wish you were here
I miss your presence, my dear
But now that you've gone, 

I can see crystal clear that I can't go on, no

Now I'm sat here, taking the blame
Maybe if I had said something different, 
Your mind would've changed
I couldn't have been more wrong, 
Because you left as soon as you came
You left as soon as you came

So that's that, there ain't nothing I can do, or say
Well, it's a long way back so I guess I'll be on my way
Am I three words too late and is it goodbye to me and us?

Singing me a song
That I’ll forget, I always forget

I try to trick myself back to sleeping

I couldn’t keep my eyelids shut
Why can’t you stay
Stay, stay

If only I could dream, we could start again
If only I could dream, we could start again

When I close my eyes I see you dancing
Dancing me a song,
Just out of reach, just out of reach

I need you in a day when I’m not dreaming
You pick me up, I don’t wanna let you down

It was so clear, but now it’s gone

And as the waves grow
Harder the days go
Darling I'm folding

Lex Valk,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Lex Vandyke,"Used to be so easy to give my heart away.
But I found out the hard way,
there's a price you have to pay.
I found out that love was no friend of mine.
I should have known time after time.
So long, it was so long ago,
but I've still got the blues for you.
Used to be so easy to fall in love again.
But I found out the hard way,
it's a road that leads to pain.
I found that love was more than just a game.
You're playin' to win, but you lose just the same.
So long, it was so long ago,
but I've still got the blues for you.
So many years since I've seen your face.
Here in my heart, there's an empty space
where you used to be.

there is one thing I know.
I've still got the blues for you.",Still Got the Blues

I'm right here.  Right here.  Cheapshot, where you at?

[Big Oak]
See it took movin' with a fleet foot
So the key should be to move limbs
It's all sink or swim
And I never even [unintelligible] and just slippin' to the bottom
Just locked on to my targets
When they close enough I shot 'em
That's just how I do, already showed you
But when you fall too many times that gets old too
So now I promise that you'll never hear me complain again
Cause when it comes to paying dues you're forced to stay in debt
People came and went, my savings spent
But I'm just happy I can pay my rent
Although it takes me for my very last cent
I never break down, prefer instead to break ground
You can't hang the shake down and run through the night
I'm to busy makin' moves to get caught up in your fight
You try to raise it up but couldn't find the wind for your kite
I simply worked harder, and now I'm set for the clock

As a kid they said to follow your heart
Put your right foot forward and your left at the start
You gotta be straight and narrow, slicked back with a part
Follow the light or get stuck in the dark
Man, ain't shit changed, gotta switch lanes
Break down the wall if you don't flip frames
I'm new to you but I got practice at this
Every day it's an impression of Atlas
And the fact is, I never gave up, gave in, or tapped out
Got too much pride for that
And it's an uphill climb, I get so tired that I pass out
But I ain't slidin' back, I've
Lost hope, watched it come out of nothing
Heard a lot of talk, seen a lot of bluffing and
I learned somthin' man, every day I stay breathin'
That's what separates tryin' from believin'

Our living room, just turns into a battlefield
I try to duck down but it feels like I'm falling
Losing round by the way you're shooting back at me

Do you really want me, to die for you
Why don't you see that I'm dying, see that I'm dying
Do you really want me, to die for you?

Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me

This is how it started, and this is how it ends
It's getting quiet, I'm walking out the door
I'm so tired, no reason to pretend
We lost the fire, we froze into the core

Now I see that you're crying, see that you're crying
But it doesn't feel like you're crying over me
You would know that I'm lying, know that I'm lying
If I would tell you that I still believe

Hates the theatre but, never comes late

I wished for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from the city of angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes
Shook her hand around 9pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV

[Chorus:]

Everybody knows her name
Want to take her picture and they're glad she came
But I just want to be there when she's down, down 
(Be there when she's down)
I don't want her autograph
I just want to call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on the movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

I met a fly girl and I can't relax

Wondering where you are
Do I cross your mind in the warm sunshine

Yeah, so I wished for you on a bright, shining star 
Everywhere I look, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress
She took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for the better day
To the beat why'all and scooby snacks

I know it seems to long but listen
I gotta do what I gotta do
And the wheels on the bus go round
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
What would jack and diane do?
Hey sharona I don't understand
Why we gotta argue all the time
You got your life and I got mine
I think it's time I press rewind
Stop when the red lights flashes
Oopsey daisy, my whole world crashes
What's a wanna be rock star to do?
All I wanna do is be with you
Every single time I turn away
You say ""that's it! I'm never coming back till you say your sorry""

I know it seems to long, but listen

And the wheels on the bus go round.
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
What would jack and fiane do?

Gimme the microphone and I'm a get buck wild
Gimme the microphone I kick my kungfu style

Hey sharona c'mon hold my hand
Talk to me and help me understand
Tell me how my eye got black and blue
Can I spend another night with you
Sippin on purple passion
Laugh at me 'cause I ain't in fashion
Sometimes you do what you gotta do
All I wanna do is be with you
Every single time I turn away
You say ""that's it! I'm never coming back till you say your sorry""

If our love goes off the track
Pick it up pick it up pick it up

Please tell her to leave my things out front
By the porch
And of course there's no need for remorse
Would you please keep the fish
I'll come back after this
But I can't. that's a lie
I just won't say good bye
I'm sorry

LFO you're on
I was at a party with my mind in the gutter
She walked in behind me with her friend and her brother
Stepped onto the dance floor shakin' her hips
I thought I might bust when she licked her lips 
Sometimes I wish I was someone like Brad Pitt
She'd walk right over to me and then say 
""Hey we should split"" 
Sometimes I wish I had a girlie that looked that fine 
Not thinking 'bout forever, just six minutes of her time

[Chorus:]
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got me on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin' please
Another minute and she shows me somethin' new
I need six minutes with you, six minutes

I was at work with my mind in the gutter
She was in a magazine her face on the cover
Lying in a room that was lit by a candle 
That's the type of girl
That I wish that I could handle
Sometimes I wish I looked like Tom Cruise 
'Cause in a crowded room would I be the one she would choose?
Sometimes I wish a girl like that could be mine 
Not thinkin' 'bout forever just six minutes of her time

Sometimes I feel like the 'Catcher & The Rye'
Sometimes I wish that I could catch your eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy

Your the reason why

LFO,"Saw her on a Friday outside someones dance saloon
She was crying over someone that she felt love much too soon
I said: ""Hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town""
She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed of the ground
With half a wink she asked me ""What are you some kind of creep?""
I told her ""No I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep""
The moon hung over Soho and I counted 16 stars
I pointed at the brightest one and said ""Now that one's ours""

She's a dandelion up on her hill, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on

I just might be poison but he took me to his roof top
He said ""Are you affraid of hights?"" I said ""No I am not""
He said ""Hey girl don't you lie to me, tell me everythin you feel""
We danced around in circles, he said ""I think we felt somethin real""

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on

Down in Union Square I saw her walking all alone
I walked a little slower just so I remain unknown
She met someone on 17 think she knew him all to well
My little piece of heaven has a secret she won't tell
Without the smile she took his hand and then they walked away
I realised I wouldn't see my girl after today
I fell in love with a dandelion and she's all I ever had
At first she looked so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on
And I tell myself hold on hold on hold on, and hold on hold on hold on

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed

Afraid to sleep, cause I see her

Can you erase her, erase her, can you leave the past behind

It's all so cold, it's all so cold, a dirty game

But I just laugh about it cause she's always playing those games
Deep down I know she loves me but she's got a funny way of showing me how she cares (she cares)
Last night she did a donut on my lawn then drove off with one finger in the air (oh yeah)

Sometimes it's black
Sometimes it's white

Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about and we figure it out
But then she just changes her mind

But when I think about it
I'm so in love with her

Sometimes we sit around just the two of us on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around like two dolphins in the oceans of our hearts
But then I think about the time when we broke up before the prom
And you told everyone that I was gay, OK
Sometimes I walk around the town
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down
Cause that's the way, Uh huh Uh huh, I like it

Would you give me just one look
If I wrote some obscure book?
Would you give me just one chance
In some other circumstance?

Someone like me deserves someone like you

Marlyn without a Joe D'maggio
Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?
In the castle I'll build for you
On an island meant just for two

What if people stuck around?
What if all that's lost was found?
What if I could be
The only one that she'd ever dream of?

If I was the great Houdini
Granting wishes like a genie
If I were some big tough guy
Who went to Mars and made you cry

Told you lies because they say
Nice guys will lose anyway
In some other circumstance
Would you give me just one chance?

Someone like me deserves someone like you

Marlyn without a Joe D'maggio
Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?
In the castle I'll build for you
On an island meant just for two

What if people stuck around?
What if all that's lost was found?
What if I could be
The only one that she'd ever dream of?

What if I, what if I was the only one?

If I were a super hero
A good fella like De'niro
If I could face all my fears
Dated girls like Britney Spears

Wore black leather on a Harley
In Jamaica like Bob Marley
In some other circumstance
Would you give me just one chance?

Marlyn without a Joe D'maggio
Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?

I just want be where you are
There's a cloud that follows me at night
When I'm all-alone, your outta sight
And I ask myself, am I really the one?
Miss love I hope you realize
There's something magic in your eyes
And I hope our journeys only just begun
Drivin down the sunset
Put the top down, rock the 8 track
I smile as if to say I think you know (I think you know)
Hope-in for tomorrow but there's always hidden sorrow
Or the night before, it's time for me to go

Got no fixed abode, with nomads I am numbered.
Country lanes and byways were always my ways;
I've never fancied bein' longer.


Oh, we knew the woods and the restin' places;
And the small birds sang when winter days were over.
Then we'd pack our load and be on the road
Those were good old days for a rover.


There was open ground where a man could linger
For a week or two, for time was not our master.
Then away you'd jog with your horse and dog,
Nice and easy, no need to go faster.


Well, I've known life hard and I've known it easy;
And I've cursed the life when winter's days were dawning;
But I've laughed and sung through the whole night long;
Seen the summer sunrise in the morning.


All you freeborn men of the travelin' people
Every tinker, rolling stone, or gypsy rover;
Winds of change are blowin', old ways are going;
Your travelin' days will soon be over.

I spied a young couple so fondly did stray. 
And one was a young maide, so sweet and so fair, 
And the other one was a soldier and a brave Grenadier. 

CHORUS:  
And they kissed so sweet and comforting as they clung to each other. 
They went arm and arm down the road like sister and brother. 
They went arm and arm down the road till they came to a stream, 
and they both sat down together, love, to hear the nightingale sing.  
Then out of his knapsack he drew a fine fiddle.  
And he played her such merry tunes that you ever did hear. 
And he played her such merry tunes that the valleys did ring. 
""Oh"",softly cried the fair maide,""hear the Nightingale sing.""

Liam Clancy,"While in  the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down
the rocky road and all the way to Dublin,

Liam Clancy,"In Yarmouth town there lived a man
He had a little tavern by the strand
And the landlord had a daughter fair
Pretty little thing with golden hair 

[Chorus:]
Won't you come down
Won't you come down
Won't you come down to Yarmouth town 

One night there came a sailor man
He asked the daughter for her hand
Well I won't marry you she said
I have all I want without being wed 


[Chorus 2x]

But if with me you'd like to linger
I'll tie some string all around my finger
As you walk by, pull on my string
I'll come down and let you in 

[Chorus 2x]

Well the very next day at closing time
The sailor man goes off to the strand
And as he walks by pulls on that string
And she came down and let him right in 

[Chorus 2x]

Well he's never such a sight before
A string on her finger was all she wore 

[Chorus 2x]

So all you men who to Yarmouth go
If ya see those girls with their hair hung low
All ya gotta do is pull their strings
And they'll come down and let you right in

",The Foggy Dew
Liam Clancy,"In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty
I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind.

To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while
Behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing,
'T would make me sing,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Diddy di dee dee diddy diddy,
Diddy diddy diddy dee dee dee.

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears,
To help me to leave all my blues behind.

For standin' in your heart
Is where I want to be

Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind

It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind

For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

Without you, without you
Each song in my breast lies a burnin'
Without you, without you

This poor ship is going down
We're overboard and wasted now
If you're gonna say,
What I think you're gonna say...
Yeah.....

SOS! No use in holding nothing back.
SOS! Nights like these are rare indeed
SOS! So raise em in the air for me...

Isn't that cute? 
You should too!
So what's your pagers name?

People give me a hard time 'cause I have a wooden arse
That's why there's only sandpaper in the bathroom 
So just get over it ok!
I've got free vacation
And cable TV
I'm not a star baby
I'm a trip
Can you dig me?
I like coffee
I feel tired
I got a Dukes of Hazard tattoo
And it's not even on the frickin' tv anymore

So I told her go to hell...ok

You don't know what it feels like
To have stars in your eyes
And a thorn in your side

Turn the light off on the porch
Try to keep myself from going crazy
Light a candle, strike a match
Watch it as it fades to black
Should I go to bed?

Mom was there with flowers in her hair

Ten years after Elvis died
To a song about mother nature

And you can't color it black or white
You never know if you get it right
I hope I might, my so called life

I messed up every class
In my room, my headphones boomed
That song saved my ass, that song saved my ass

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

J'ai beau chercher sans cesse à travers les astres et les lois
Les erreurs, les faiblesses qui ont témoigné contre moi
J'en voulais des promesses, elles m'ont toutes éloigné de toi
Elles ont tué l'ivresse qui claquait au bout de nos doigts

Et doucement, j'oublierai tout doucement
Je f'rai semblant doucement
En attendant ton retour, comme dans une vieille chanson d'amour

J'ai beau chercher des rimes à travers les lignes du destin

Mais elles sont hautes les cimes quand on a le cœur orphelin

Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

On se brûle
On refait le monde pour un rien
Pour un rien
On a besoin de vivre ensemble
Pour être sur qu´on se ressemble
On se trahie
On se déteste
Mais c´est le temps
Qui fait le reste
Tout le reste

Aussi fou que les rêves
Qu´on peut faire
Aussi fort que l´écho des prières
On a tous une place sur terre
Quelque chose à faire ou à refaire

On fait semblant le masque en avant
D´aimer les gens infiniment
On se libère on croit surtout
Que le meilleur est en nous
Rien qu´en nous",Une Place Sur Terre
Liane Foly,"J´voudrais voir des signes dans des carreaux cassés
J´ai du mal à m´suivre dans c´vieux décor
Qu´est-ce que j´fait ici qu´est-ce que j´ferai dehors
Faut qu´j'aille voir la nuit passer

J´voudrais voir des signes dans les cartes et l´café
Compter les étoiles au plafond d´ce bar
J´vois qu´une boule
Une boule et des miroirs

Tu sais tout c´qui roule roule me fait partir
Où les trains m´emmènent j´veux pas l´savoir
Une chanson qui traîne, un tempo qui part
Ça suffit pour mon plaisir

J´voudrais voir mes signes mes S.O.S courir
Dans c´bateau qui coule mon sel espoir
C´est une boule une boule et des miroirs

Et comme tout c´qui tourne pas rond
Ça tourne court ces p´tites loupiotes
Quand elles me tournent autour
Elles m´font tourner la tête
Quand elles s´arrêtent
Toujours autant besoin d´amour

Dans ce train qui roule vers le soleil couchant
Sans mes satellites j´me sens bizarre
J´vois mes jours s´enfuir sur mes joues sans fard
J´me prépare au pire mais qu´est-ce que j´attends
J´attends juste un signe avec un peu d´courant
Un rideau qui s´lève et tout repart
C´est une boule une boule et des miroirs",Toujours Autant Besoin d'Amour
Liane Foly,"i livré des combats
Trouvé la force en moi
De suivre une autre voie
Où tout n'est pas perdu
Où l'on n'est pas vaincu
Tant qu'on dit? pourquoi pas
Devant des murs plus hauts que le silence
J'ai cherché une chance
Un soleil, un défi, un autre sens
Et à voir derrière les apparences
Partir de rien,
Même d'un chagrin
Devenir quelqu'un
Mais à l'intérieur?
Tomber peut-être
Oser pour être quelqu'un
À l'intérieur?

Que de moi on soit fier
Mais ça ne compte pas
Si on n'est pas heureux
Si on voit dans nos yeux
Qu'on n'est pas vraiment soi
Porter sur nos épaules, fragiles parfois,
Les rêves auxquels on croit
Décider de mes ombres, mes doutes, mes choix
Et donner, donner tout de moi?

De nuit dans le transsibérien
Un ciel qui copie les Rembrandt

That I'd been silenced by the teacher of the night

Gave me no choice I'd have to cheat to pass his unfair test

So I had to take his life

I drowned his heart in shame
I broke his arms and legs

Not a coincidence he left me because
My older man
Was ready to love me like the woman that I am

So is it such a problem if he's old?
As long as he does whatever he's told
I'm glad that it's just my heart that he stole
And left my dignity alone

I slurred my words but he pretended not to notice
And then he sat down to play
My heart sang a symphony
So far, so swimmingly
I'm glad I got up to find my fish in that sea
We've come so far
So who gives a damn about the ages we are

Lianne La Havas,"I heard a song today
On the tip of your tongue
And when I hear you play
That particular song
I go, and you stay

As I lay wide awake
Thinking 'what the hell have I done?'
Enchanted by the way you dance
At the kick of my drum
I'll go, and you stay
There must be another way

No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through

Gave you the runaround?
Baby, what the hell do I do
Bewildered by the sound
Only if it's coming from you
Ok, you paid

I've been unsatisfied
Lately when I think about us
I've swallowed so much pride
To win a little bit of your trust
You go, and I'll stay
There must be a better way

No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through

And the way you got me
The way you got me up
I can't see down
It's real now, it's real now
I can't see now

Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through",Never Get Enough

Cold neon
Not a mystery

How to be alone

Oh baby, can I hold you?
Such a cold, cold night

To know that it's alright

Libby Holman,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl,
And me, oh Lord is one

If I had listened to what my mother said
I'd have been at home today,
But I was young and foolish, Oh God
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
My sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Down in New Orleans

The only thing a drunkard needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
The only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He'll fill his glasses to the brim
He passes them around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is bumming from town to town

Go tell my baby sister,
Never do what I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

It's one foot on the platform
And the other one on the train

Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing

Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will

Oh, what miracle 
Has made you the way you are?

Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last

Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Liberace,"'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads
And mama in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of midday to objects below
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer

With a little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name

Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
So up to the house top the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkle I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night

",'Twas the Night Before Christmas

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Liberace,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

De rimes calculées de feuilles raturées
Et des heures passées à échantilloner
Sans savoir vraiment si cela marcherait
Et tous ces kilomètres que l'on s'est tapés

On arrivait le soir avec un bâton et des caligaes
Cela s'est répété tant et tant de fois que les stations d'essence
Ont le sourire aux lèvres dès qu'elles nous voient
Pour aller faire un concert à l'autre bout de la France
On avait l'impression que see'était le temps des transhumances

Celui de monter sur scène, histoire de voir si
La température augmente dans le foule peu à peu
Afin que nous puissions why mettre quoi? Le feu

Liberace,"'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads
And mama in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of midday to objects below
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer

With a little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name

Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
So up to the house top the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkle I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night

And then sleep until way past 2 
I can't believe there's so much work to do 
I guess I got to wait the whole way through 
Try something more on to get my groove on 
Make sure I'm looking cool 
Tomorrow's gonna be a great night out 
Gonna hit the club and just hang out 

The bass is pumping, music's playing 
All night long 
Hey Mr. DJ won't you play my favorite song 
So I can feel the beat and dance until the dawn 
Why don't you turn the volume up, let's get it on 

Can't wait til Saturday, 
I just want to party and I just want to play 
Call me on Friday,

You took a walk around my way
Talkin' in the warm sunshine
I fell into your brown eyes
Something came over me
I felt as though I couldn't breathe no
I think I lost myself right then
Never wanted to be found again no
In the ride
Cruisin' through the night
Leave the world behind us
Nothin' in the way now
In the dark
Sleep beneath the stars
Just to spend more time with you
(Repeat)

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

And I know (I know)
That we only do what we feel
Now you know (You know)
That we're stayin' tight that's for real
Now I know (I know)
That we only get what we give
Now you know (You know)
That it's true as long as we live

Liberty X,"I never knew this would be hard 
But now my heart is breaking down
I always thought I'd hear you call my name 
Now I can't hear a sound

If there is a chance you know I will
Relight the fire that we killed
(Do you know)

Is there another way
There's still so much to say
And I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's impossible
You said we were invincible
The situation's critical but I believe we can survive
Cause my heart cries, my soul dies every time we say goodbye
Don't tell me it's impossible to save this heart of mine

I never thought that we'd be strangers after all that we'd become
I never knew my world would come crashing down 
The moment you were gone
Is time running out for things to change

Cause I can see light through all the rain
Don't say it's over now
We'll make it work somehow
Without you I don't know where to begin

We got lost along the way
But when the night is over
We could live another day
Cause something taking over
People change but love remains the same

Liberty X,"Never thought that I could feel the way I feel
Summer's over, clouds appear and all that's left
Are memories
The sands of time rush by oh

Can't even believe that this has been 
More than a daydream
In the silence as the waves crash
We can run from our uncertainties

There's only you and I
As the dawn is breaking and the darknesss
Turns to daylight, we release one
Another from the warmth that kept us

Safe at night, there's nowhere left to run
Wish that I could stay a while lost in
You forever, maybe I'm not strong enough
To face alone the threat of stormy weather

Blinded by the sun

So I've had my cry, no more tears
Tonight, 'cause the stars are shining brightly
In the sky, so lay down with me
I want to touch ya like the breeze
This could be our last goodbye

Anytime that you need somebody
By your side, 
I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave , 
you leave a piece of you behind, 
this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you there's nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight

Hardly can believe the time has come
I gotta leave you lonely
Knew that it was just a little fun

I know it's getting harder to let go

I'm the darker side
I can make you scream honey believe me
I can blow your mind

You're trying to hide yourself so let go

Guess I'm kinda shy
I don't like too much attention

For my destination
When I saw you go the other way

Liberty X,"You stole a poem from a book
Made believe that it was yours
You seduced me with those words
And I couldn't help but fall

I fell in love with you that night
I let the lyrics speak to me
They cast a spell upon my heart
With their sensuality

The truth is you were faking it
That beautiful verse was counterfeit
Caught you doin' a de Bergerac
You may be cute, yeah
But I need deeper than that

If writing on paper can steal my heart away
Just imagine what his lips on my body would say
If words were kisses, he'd be making love to me
Arousing my emotions, touching me with poetry
(I want the poet)

Take my eyes, my heart, my soul
For without you, girl, I'm incomplete, un-whole
Baby, you were well rehearsed
With your borrowed pick-up lines
Your pretty eyes gave you away
Body language doesn't lie
(The truth is)
The truth is I'm not faking it
He stole my words, he's counterfeit
('Cause I'm the poet)
I'm not doing a de Bergerac
You need to hear me, girl
I'm deeper than that

If writing on paper can steal your heart away
Just imagine what my lips on your body would say
If words were kisses, you'd be making love with me
With me

The wind howls, the earth shakes
The rivers flood, the dam breaks
I gotta hear his voice, I gotta touch his skin
Gonna search the world till I find him

Thine kiss is unknown to me
Shall there be no reason yet to breathe
And if your heart is spoken for
Condemned am I forever more

If writing on paper can steal your heart away
Just imagine what my lips on your body would say
If words were kisses, you'd be making love with me
Arousing your emotions
Touching you with poetry

And every chapter ends in tears 
Sometimes I fear I've had my share of happiness 
It's gotta last me all my years 

And looking in your eyes it makes me wonder 
Do I have a chance again? 
Now suddenly I feel I'm starting over 
Like it's time to turn the page 

It's the story of my life 
Can you help me write 
The words I need to say 
In a better way 

Can you help me see 
The person I could be 
Read between the lines
Can you help me write 

The story of my life? 

Do you ever feel like your destiny is written for you? 
And you only play the part? 
'Cause I believed in fate the moment that I saw you
Your name was written on my heart 

And looking in your eyes I feel a sense of wonder 
I know I have a chance again

Running out of gas

Drunk on the mainstream
Stuck in the system
Just another face, if you blink you'll miss 'em

Break through invisible doors
They're locked tight
By my own fear but the time's near, unplug myself
Get my life into 5th gear

Could be earning bucks

I never thought I'd find my self this close
This close to you my dea
Tell me what it means (got to have your love)

I can feel your sweet caress
Wash away all the loneliness that I once felt
Inside my heart, oh yeah
Boy if you can read my mind 
I'm sure that you could find
What you've been searching for
What you've been searching for

Listen up
It's like this
You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery
(Such a mystery)

Butterflies I feel inside must be
(Must be)
Must be
(Must be)
A sign of love
No one can disagree
My desire for your love
Is like a new horizon only lovers see
Like you and I
The signal that will be the start
To synchronize our hearts
I love ya till my dying day
Until my dying day-ay!

Y otro amor encontrare
Sé que no es fácil perder y ahora me toco a mi

Perdido en mis lágrimas, no acariciare tu piel
Tus besos yo los guardo en mi, ya no estás junto a mí

Tu fuiste mi inspiración, un poema, una canción
Pero mi mente ya olvidó, no hay rencores , no hay dolor

Tu indiferencia me tocó el alma, tus labios me quitaron la miel,
Tus ojos me robaron la razón

Sé que no me olvidarás, que nadie te amará

Lid,"Mary Agnes made me space cakes one day
Anticipation is all you can taste
Feeling creepy sensations of the skin
The ceremony is about to begin
And I'm so obliged, for making it clear to me
Now in vain I do purpose today
The uplifting of my frigid lid
What's the pleasure of this ecstasy
The beauty of the earth and the painted sky
And I'm so obliged, for making it clear to me I can hear
The grass grow
I can hear the grass grow",Mary Agnes

Te convertiste en mi mundo, 
Y nos ganamos el cielo, 
En un eterno segundo

Tenemos un camino, porque juntos lo elegimos.

Soy tu alegría, tu amor, tu porvenir,

Lo que quería por fin lo conseguí,
Que la llama siga viva,
Tenemos una vida por vivir.

Ya no hay herida que duela,
Somos el nudo de un lazo,
Somos dos almas gemelas,
Que al amor no ponen condición,
Estaba escrito en el destino,
Era un sueño y lo cumplimos.
