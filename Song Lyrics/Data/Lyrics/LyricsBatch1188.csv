Stevie Wonder,"She's a Miss Beautiful Supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's gotta be number one
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

She's the sunflower of nature's seeds
A girls that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one they start to light up the sky
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

Yeah, yea yea
Yeah
Pretty black beauty
Yeah, yea yeah
Yea, yea, yeah, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
Ebony eyes",Ebony Eyes
Stevie Wonder,"There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if your's you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God He cares

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Thank-you
Thank-you very much",Have a Talk with God
Stevie Wonder,"I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know

And baby that's you you you
Made life's his-to-ry
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby, baby it's you you you
Made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be
He why, you brought some joy inside my tears
Gotta tell you
You you you made life's history
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears

You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his-to-ry
You you you made life's his-to-ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
Nobody ever thought it would be
You have done what no one thought could be

You you you made life's history
Gotta shout about it baby
You brought some joy inside my tears

You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You you you made life's history
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my, tears",Joy Inside My Tears

Stevie Wonder,"When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart

You're just a masachistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a play boy you said no
Ordinary pain
This little girl mind you will blow
Ordinary pain
But then I blew you out the box
Ordinary pain
When I put my stuff on key and lock
Ordinary pain
It makes me feel kind of sick
Ordinary pain
To know love put you in a trick
Ordinary pain
I knew our love would have to end
Ordinary pain
The day I made it with your friend
Ordinary pain
Giving your love to one unreal
Ordinary pain
Like a big fool I know you feel
Ordinary pain
But in this lovie-dovie game
Ordinary pain
With all its joy there must be pain
Ordinary pain
But now the time has surely come
Ordinary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
Ordinary pain
You're cryin big corcodile tears
Ordinary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
Ordinary pain
When I was home wainting for you
Ordinary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
Ordinary pain
You know I'd really like to stay
Ordinary pain
But like you did I've go to play
Ordinary pain
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
Ordinary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
Ordinary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
Ordinary pain
But to your music I can't dance
Ordinary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
Ordinary pain
About you blowin what you had
Ordinary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
Ordinary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
Ordinary pain

Ordinary pain",Ordinary Pain
Stevie Wonder,"Packing my bags going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold

I'm
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

I'm
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high",Saturn
Stevie Wonder,"Summer soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze

Morning rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your window pane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play

Winter wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers way with his breeze

Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
'Cause you've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone",Summer Soft
Stevie Wonder,"Ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby you remind me of a pretty rose
That's awfully painful to my touch
And though there's thorns underneath the rose
Baby you hurt twice as much

You made me cry a thousand times, ha
And leaving me with a broken heart
I should stand many miles away
But I'm right here in your arms

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby the way I'm at your beck and call
I must be hypnotised
'Cause I, I know I've got sense enough to know
That loving you ain't wise

Sure as the sun may shine
My heart will be in pain
Like a child that's seen papa
I'm in your arms again

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby I, I can't stop my loving you
Until you hurt me so much
My plans not to see you again
Baby but your tender touch
I guess I'm just too weak for you
I shoulda been so long gone
But here I'm in your arms again
And I'm still holding on

Now ain't that asking for trouble",Ain't That Asking for Trouble
Stevie Wonder,"I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world

Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl

And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true,
Oh ho ho

When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me

Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true",Angie Girl
Stevie Wonder,"Mm
On the beach where young lovers meet
You can see them there as they sit and build
Castles in the sand

Heavenly she's so heavenly
When she smiles at you
And she helps you build castles in the sand

The time comes when you stop pretending
For all dreams must come to an ending
Remember what happens to castles of sand
The sea will wash them away
Oh

And the beach where they used to meet
By the sand and sea waves have washed away
Castles in the sand
Castles in the sand
Where did they go
Castles in the sand
Tell me, where did they go
Castles in the sand
I wanna know where did they go",Castles in the Sand

Stevie Wonder,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby love me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
And that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah hey hey hey
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Will never fade when darkness falls
They say that when the chips are down girl
Your love won't stay so long my friend
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Has been around through thick and thin

Don't you know I'm wondering 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him? 
Ooh,Baby I'm wondering 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him? 
Oh baby 

Jimmy was your sweetie pie 
Your precious one 
And I knew you used to love 
The very ground he walked upon 
One day, Jim's papa told him 
Things were looking down 
And they packed up everything 
They owned and left this little old town 
Each tear I dried for you, 
The closer our lives grew, 
I fell in love it's true 
And you say you love me, too 

But, baby I'm wondering 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him? 
Oh baby I'm wondering, 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved Jim? 

The day you see his face again 
Or hear his voice 
I don't want to be a loser 
If you have to make a choice 
Like a puppet to a string 
To you, girl, I'm attached 
And I know I'd be in trouble 
If he came and took you back 
I feel so insecure 
In my mind, I can picture 
Losing you for sure 
And the pain I can't endure 

Oh baby I'm wondering 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him? 
Oh baby I'm wondering, 
Sure enough, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved Jim? 
Ooh Baby 

I can't stop loving you, baby, 
I can't stop loving you , no 
I can't stop loving you, baby 

I feel so insecure 
In my mind, I 
Can picture 
Losing you for sure 
And the pain I can't endure 
Baby, I'm worried, 
Really, really worried 
I want to make you happy 
Really truly happy

How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines
I never, never had a dream come true
Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never crossed
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams
Do do do do do
I never, never had a dream come true
Yes, I'm gonna dream about you baby my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams

A new way waiting to be born
In a world with need for change
A touch of love in fear of hate
A rushing wind that's asked to wait
For the promises of rain
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty

She gives love with purity
Filling minds with hopeful schemes
To build worlds enhanced by peace
Draped in sparkling morning dew
She expresses life anew
From the earth beneath her feet
She is a flower that grows
In love ability, she's femininity

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they make you begin
When they know in time you'll find your truth
Before your cycle ends?

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why are you crying their fears
When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years?

She has touched the farthest star
Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity, infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature sings out her name
For the world to know her fame

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they criticize
When they knew your love could cast its spell
And consecrate their eyes?

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why do you linger in space
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place?

When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place

Don't hold back your feelings

And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love’s passion

Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Don't hold back your feelings

And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love’s glory

That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we
But with instruments Bose would devise
Would take science itself by a surprise, so

To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again

Born of slaves who died too soon to realize
The need his life would be
Selflessly he gave
His wisdom to a way where first no minds would see

He said, ""If farm land was to be rich
We must plant crops to replenish it""
But it took him persuasion and tests
To convince them Canver's way was best, so

(Aisha) If you say please
(Keita) Please

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping 
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say 
Before his father said hey boy get right back in that bed

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you

Show me how to do it

Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said no
Keita's much too young to go
But his sister said please let him go so the world can see
When they saw him they said he must be crazy
Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you

Stevie Wonder,"I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back in nineteen-sixty-four
At sixteen, I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam, where I got my leg shot off
I recall a quote form a movie that said ""who's more a man
Than a man with a reason that's worth dyin' for?""

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said ""shoot until he's dead""
But it's hard to kill when ""please, I'm your friend"" echoes through your head
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in the jungle where life has no price, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Back in the world, the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday?
And the many happy families that have been ruined?
My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie, too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say quit ""braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in""
But my mind is so brainwashed I'd probably go back and do it again
I walk the neighborhood, parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Would you believe I do?

They had me standing on the front line

On the corner at the end of the block

No more wearing a frown

Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide
Mighty, shining and clear
Are but mere expressions that don't come near
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight

Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

Gentle, quiet, so soft
Are the wings of love that can send us off
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time
Trusting in the unknown and giving in to what feelings have shown
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives

There was always someone close at hand
That you could always run to 

You could have been a doctor
And you could have been a nurse

Then you turn around to pick up the duffel bag

Your bag has taken off walking 

You dig in your wallet
To get your last dime
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper
You're much too prideful
But pride has no defense
When all you've got in your possession
Is the wallet in your hands

And that's enough to make anybody go wild

One rainy April Monday
Smiling soft and warm as on
A clear December Sunday
Wearing taffeta and lace
That matched her braided hair
With their coraled beads that sang to me  

She said 'hi' and asked me why
Was I looking with sorrow
When there were much brighter days
In store for me tomorrow 

I looked up at her and smiled
And said, why I don't know
But would she agree, to stay with me
And she said
Never in your sun, she said
Never in your sun, then she said
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain 

So if you are at lover's park
And someone looks with sorrow
Ask them why are they so sad
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow
They'll reply they don't know why
And ask you please to stay
'Til the end of time, and when they're fine 

Be kind and say
Never in your sun, just tell them
Never in your sun, then say
I will only come
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain",Never in Your Sun
Stevie Wonder,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far
For you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me

Over heart, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over love, over you,
Over you",Overjoyed

Where is the missing one, the missing one  

There is a missing person that I've just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I can't say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me 

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you 

Where is the missing one, the missing one
 I looked inside an album of happy photographs
To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I traveled through the moments that held a special place
But every time what came to mind is that smile upon your face  

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do

A honeymoon out of a dream
Who could ask for, anything more  

A home on a hill
With love daffodils
And cold winter nights by the fire
What more could be, for she and he  

There's more than enough love and yet
She or he starts feeling regret

She's the one who brings me morning joy
And brings me joy when my day ends
She says my life will never have no problems
That her love cannot fix
Every time she goes into her love bag of tricks

Everything I need

Make your love come down

When she whispers Stevland, 
I love you, I love you, I love you

Such a lovely world is my life
Since that girl has come inside
And everyday that I live
I'm gonna do my best to keep her satisfied

Free from conceiving the beginning

Life goes on without a beating heart

I want you to listen to my story

While I tell you, mmm

Hello young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All of my good wishes go with you tonight
Yeah, I've been in love like you

Oh be brave young lovers, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave, be faithful and true
You've got to cling to each other, very close tonight
I've been in love like you, hey

I've had a love of my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had a love of my own

I know how it feels, ha, to have wings on your heels
And fly down the street in a trance
You fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers, young lovers, yeah

Stevie Wonder,"My love is gone with yesterday

We had a love for all seasons
At least that's how it used to be
There was no time, space, or reason
More special to us than we

My love continued to flourish
As a flower blooms in spring
Then you tried to play love for silly
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play
Love by the rules

If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

My love is gone with yesterday

There was a time when forever
Was common-place for me and you
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
Seemed to be made just for us two
But I kept on building the dream world
That I thought was you and I
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Cause our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye

Well if she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday",If She Breaks Your Heart
Stevie Wonder,"I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each other's baby, we're in love

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love

She can't love me, I can't love her
Cause they say we're the wrong color
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking
Like we've done something wrong
Because we show love strong, get real, come on
Calling us names too bad to mention
But we pay them no attention
For color blind are inner feelings
If we feel happiness
And know our love's the best, forget their mess

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each other's baby, we're in love

Everyone's created equal
Hell with all you ignorant people
Trying to stereo type us
You really ought to quit
Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me
Because I got my girl beside me
You'll only make yourself look stupid
I love you're trying to dis
Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one

But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see

Stevie Wonder,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone",If It's Magic

Do do do, do do do, do do do-oo

I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were

With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best

Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Da da da, da da da, da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da-aa

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go

Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Oh, oh, oh, took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to into this cold, cold world

I would not do that to a dog
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

Stevie Wonder,"Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land

See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals-from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police

Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink-drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief

Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land

Stevie Wonder,"Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, 
I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come 
From too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true 
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be 
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone 
Just to find, 
I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be 
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance 
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you",Overjoyed [Natural Wonder Live Version]

No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze

Stevie Wonder,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
But thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go",I Wish

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye",Lately
Stevie Wonder,"A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah

His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city, um hum

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city

To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" when part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, its really you my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers",Part-Time Lover

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old-fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make-believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory, hey

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's coming from your heart

Stevie Wonder,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out

Stevie Wonder,"Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold

Yet filled with sorrow and compassion

Will age too old

That you'll leave torn apart

She'll change my tears to joy from sad

That they heard you say
Mother or father, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Daughter or son, I love you

Ones you say you cherish everyday
Can instantly be taken away
Then you'd say I know this can't be true
When you never took the time
To simply tell them ""I love you""

When was the last time
That they heard you say
Sister or brother, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Darling or best friend, I love you

The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you'd didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so

These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all

Short and kind

Stevie Wonder,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

Stevie Wonder,"Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well

The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever

God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you God (I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever)

Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love (don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me)

If I gotta get up early in the morning for a job interview
And I forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playin' outside like little children do
And you come 'round there tryin' to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should I be drivin' through a klantown, find a restaurant to get me some food
And someone says ""hey boy, we don't serve your kind""
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your power to vote
Knowin' some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us

Shame on them, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

If I'm hooked on a habit knowin' damn well it could cost me my life
Yet I keep doin' what I should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jammin' the music and somebody's got the audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that we are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss, say what the fuss

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss, yeah, say what the fuss

I say what the fuss
I say what the fuss

Stevie Wonder,"We have time for racism
We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's
When will there be a time to love

We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgments
When will there be a time to love

At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions
When will there be a time to love

We make time to conquer nations
Time for oil exploration
Hatred, violence and terrorism
When will there be a time to love

At this moment in time
We have a choice to make
Father God is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It's such a shame

Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more
When will there be a time to love

We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences
If we don't make the time to love

Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time to love
A time love, love
A time to Love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love",A Time to Love
Stevie Wonder,"Call up, ring once, hang up the phone 
To let me know you made it home 
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 
If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights 
To let you know tonight's the night 
For me and you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers 
But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peep its really you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover 
And then a man called our exchange 
But didn't want to leave his name 
I guess that two can play the game 
Of part-time lovers 
You and me, part-time lovers 
But, she and he, part-time lovers

Stevie Wonder,"If I ruled the world
Every day would be
The first day of Spring
Every heart would have
A new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy
Every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be
As free as a bird
Every voice would be
A voice to be heard
Take my word
We would treasure each day
That occurred

My world would be
A beautiful place
Where we would weave
Such a wonderful dream
My world would wear
A smile on its face
Like the man in the moon
When the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say
The world was his friend
There'd be happiness
That no man could end
No my friend
Not if I ruled the world
Every head
Would be held up high
There'd be sunshine
In everyone's sky
If day ever dawned
When I ruled the world
If I ruled the world",If I Ruled the World [1968 Outtake]

But I ain't touched the sky

Too high, too high

Too high, so high
I hope I never ever come down

Too high, too high
But I ain't touched the sky

Too high, so high
I feel like I'm about to die",Too High [Album Version]
Stevie Wonder,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go",I Wish [Single Edit]

He would turn on his heels and go
No backward glancing
What he said last night you still can't quite recall
You can try, you can try
But you just can't win 'em all
One good turn deserves another
He wasn't the first to leave you this way
Oh you tried so hard to keep your bases covered
Now you say that no one told you
'Bout the price you had to pay
Wasn't it you
Who said that nothing mattered
Wasn't it you
Who had to have it all

Man start beef with the kid that ain't good for your health like aloe vera
You never knew I'm a old school legend, plus I bang in goals like Alan Shearer
Step to the mic, full reloads, eight bars, you don't wanna step to the mic
Fam just know when you step to the mic, I'm a old school legend like Alan Shearer",Alan Shearer

Let me call this nigga
Come on man; pick up the damn phone

[Brother]
Hello

[Sticky]
I got your pictures, damn we look just alike
A younger version of me, half my age same height
I played ""beat you up"", made you tough, thought you to fight
Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite
Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did
That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid
Caged like an animal ain't no way to live
Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid
Where you going now I can clearly see
You either going in an bag or in jail with me
Remember when we was younger and you promised me
You be the first in our fam with al college degree
I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels
And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school
I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna
Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner
You're my baby brother

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
You are my baby brother 
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

[Brother]
I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me
I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D
When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee
Yeah you right I want jewels and push a luxury V
But what's wrong with that, I want to love comfortably
Just like the next man driving round the hood in my Lex Land
I ain't got nobody taking care of me 
And as far as a school, well it just ain't for me 

[Sticky & Brother]
So what you want to do huh
What you gone sell drugs all your life
(I might)
See you ain't even right
Maybe when you sober up to see the light
(Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like)
Yo look I'm just trying to help
You know all you want to do is get blunted
(I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach)
If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind
And your child getting a father that was just like mine
You're my baby brother

[Chorus]

[Sticky & Brother]
So is you like that. I mean what's the deal?
Don't you too worry about trying to keep it real?
(Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel)
Yo what's this I hear, you had a gun concealed
(Yeah, I keep my nine (See this what I?.)
(Hold up, let me speak my mind
Look at you, you can't even talk you doing mad time)
Yeah look at me, this is how you want to be
Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee
(I got to go man)
Ooh you don't even want to hear me out?
(Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about)
All I saying is that you got to be more responsible
(Aight man, whatever I'm a talk to you)

[Sticky]
Yo, yo.... Damn
He gone end up just like me

Sticky Fingaz,"This is to my niggas up in here with they fuckin' shorties and
shit...your girls...your wifies and shit...this is to them niggas...

(Chorus 1)
Victoria don't know how to keep a secret
like a nigga need pussy, a bitch need dick
statistics show that out of every ten hoes
whether married or in love done cheatin' befo'
and if they did it once, they'll probably do it again
turn your back, Jerry Springer style, screwin' your friend
and that alone's enough to make any niggas furious
nigga you wasn't hittin' it right, maybe she's just curious

(Verse 1)
You all serious, your girl all gigglin'
'cause she know I'm right, somebody slid up in that clitoris 
(somebody slid up in that clitoris) 
(somebody slid up in that clitoris)
how to know if your girl cheatin'
does she go out every weekend?
freakin', you and her hardly speakin'
she hang with hoes, and you hate them chicks
leave the club around Three, don't get home 'till Six
probably met some nigga, she ain't goin' home
claim the battery died on her mobile phone
you found a number, she swear she don't know who's it is
she know more niggas than you in the music biz
you try to talk to her, but she's in her own World
on the phone with some nigga, actin' like it's her home girl
you don't think your girl got bones in her closet?
bring it up she starts an arguement and change the topic. 

(Chorus 2)
aiyo, turn it up, and take a look at your bitch
if she smilin' somebody stuck a dick in your bitch
now think about when you're not around, who she be wit'?
and think about the bullshit you got away wit'

(Verse 2)
You better pay attention now, or you gon' cry later
middle of the night, a nigga blowin' up her skypager
you can't hear it though, she got it on vibrator
she be creepin' 'cause you think she gon' violate her
when you havin' sex is she already sore?
did the pussy feel like it was tighter before?
is she gettin' gifts she couldn't only afford?
been together for a Month and she already bored?
if your girl is cheatin' with her legs open wide
you never know, she could be playin' from both sides
she could be playin' with another chick G.
'cause nowadays all bitches ain't strictly dickly.

(Chorus 2) - 2X

(Talking to girl)
Aiyo...
huh?...
let me ask you somethin'...
yeah?...
you love me?
yeah I love you
huh...yeah right...

(Chorus 3: repeat 2X)
It was just sex, probably ain't mean nothin' to her
it was just sex, it was just a fuck to her
no emotion, no love, no feelings inside
it was only one time, it was only one night",Cheatin'

[Verse 1]
Oh you ain't know?
Sticky Fingaz went solo
And got the whole hood in a choke hold
Radio locked like I was po-po
You rappers get no dough
I make you have oral sex with the fo-fo
I'm unstable, get cash under the table
I blaze you, not even God could save you
What?! I ain't havin it, I'm ignorant and arrogant
Dogs couldn't sniff me out, 'cause I ain't have a scent
Your wifey's checkin me, said I had sex appeal
Been hittin niggas' girls, way before the record deal
Let me make it clear just so it's understood
That don't make you no thug 'cause you from the hood
My nine's stainless, I speak in sign language
My mind changes, every time the wind blows
Gunshots got me jumpin out of second story windows
Beef on impulse, you get murdered over insults

HOOK

[Verse 2]
Goddamn I'm hungry, and it's time to eat
I'm the worst thing since crack to hit the street
The man that could murder me, I'm dyin to meet
Rapper fuck your own seed and shoot a 5 wit me
I intake shit from no man, I set up my own fam
I never was a kid came out the pussy a grown man
I slept in a slum, I'm second to none
I give you ten seconds to run, 9, 7, 3, 2 1! BLAU!
Half my niggas ain't gon' never see sunlight
Got twenty stitches under my navel from a gunfight
You better watch your back for them thug hoes
I believe in safe sex and go to bed with a snub nose
Rhyme like my life on the line, I'm nice with the nine
Knockin out big niggas twice my size
So take a dirt nap when normal people slept I used to purse snatch
A bullet costs a quarter, but your life ain't even worth that

HOOK

[Verse 3]
It's a whole new me, but the same old you
We had beef before well deja vu
Never seen nothing like this I rip your whole crew
Ever thought about death, that's what you bout to go through
I stay to myself, I'm anti-social
I ghost you, and wild out like I'm supposed to
My rollie got a body son, it costs a life
Every time it tick I can see the soul on ice
I call a hotline, to get yours, I got mine
And son I got glock nines, tech nines, mack 10's 11's and 12's
22's, 25's, 32's, 38's, 44's, 45's, AK-47's
Don't be a smartass, I put a hole in your forehead
Stomp you out and beat yo' ass to syllables...
You... stupid.... mother, be lucky I ain't killin you all
I hung myself on my umbilical cord

I'm iceburg to my feet about a third of the week
Relax baby don't spazz 'cause he touched your ass
I ain't say shit when your friend touched my dick
I see Brooklyn schemin, we all in the spot
But that's hip hop, we rap niggaz from off the block
Is it me or is it gettin hot in here
I think somebody bout to get shot in here
The nine mill guaranteed to clear the spot in here
And we ain't get searched kid, we got glocks in here
Someone bring me to the hoe suckin cocks in here

Everybody gettin comped, I ain't paying no admission
Stick Fingaz, I can't even pay attention
Love the freaks that tweek and be liftin it up
Love the freaks that ceep and be giving it up
I got twelve inches, I'm well hung
Nine on my dick and three on my toungue
My manager, the bitch name is Helen Wate
Need a free show? Nigga go to Hell and wait
And if God only helped those who help themselves
When I see something, I want em, I help myself
So unless me and you come to an understanding
You gonna be under, and I'ma be standing

My killers is rough, shoot up the club like Puff
Niggaz'll duck, chains tucked, Timbs get scuffed
I pull a four-four from out of the seat
Up out it and beat
Picture me not riding with heat
Jump out of the Jeep
Clear a nigga out of the street
Nobody can creep
Thirty deep nigga, I'm out of your reach
Ain't nothing but killers boasting next to me
I'm prejuduce, I hate every color except for green
In the club, that's were my niggaz jwewlry shop
When the hammer cock, we don't care who we box
So why you come to the club, what you livin it up
Why you fuckin with that chicken, was she givin it up
Why you even cop jewels, what you can't get stuck
Why you never say when, you ain't had enough

My heart bleeds for you, so don't waste your tears
I'm about 175 in dog years
My block's so hot step outside and get sunburned
Unless you talkin' business or money I'm unconcerned

I live for now because my days is numbered
I got a six shot revolver, watch the barrel on my gun turn
I'm like an accident just waitin' to happen
A nigga fuck, my killas in the cut waitin' to clap 'em

It's pitiful this game is too political, critical
But let's not talk about the big I's and the little you's
Niggas wouldn't be confused if they mind their P's and Q's
Keep your nose out of mine and I won't have to squeeze the two's

And cock the glock, what's that sound?
Everybody know Sticky be puttin' it down
So watch out watch out, niggas better clear a path
Think I'm scared to blast 'cause I'm doing flicks on Miramax
And New Line

Fuck security, my bodyguard is my two nines
Knew I'd make it big in due time
My only lie when my lips move
Gun in my crotch my forth leg is a pistol, who wanna get shot?

Until I smell 'em for myself I don't believe shit stink
Robbing niggas for everything but the kitchen sink
And all these whack rappers want deals but no can do

Every [Incomprehensible] I kick is a gunshot

Back in the days Sticky was stickin' niggas
And strippin' niggas and still gettin' figures
And pistol whippin' niggas and flippin' niggas
I ran with life bidders and ice pickers

Now wonder if this life fit us in Vegas with strippin' white bitches
But that's just a deep thought in the back of my mind
I'm Black Trash true to the streets gritty and grime
I got a bone to pick a holdster with a shoulder grip
Concealed inside my leather camouflage so I can ride, notice it?

Don't tell nobody, but between me and you I put three in you
Add you and ya crew to the M E N you
I got bloopers of ya death and I draw it myself
You want the job done right you gotta do it yourself

My code defendin' my conscience, my mind afflicted with monsters
Kill a nigga over nonsense for five cents
You a glutton for punishment, I'm the nigga runnin' shit
Yo breath stank that cause you be talkin' a ton of shit

You can't take me out, forget about it
Killers in front of ya house, forget about it
Y'all niggas don't want no war, forget about it
I'll bring it to your front door and you won't do shit about it

You need work, come see me son I'm takin' applications
You can't beat me join me save yourself the aggravation
You dead if you harm a single hair on my head
My payback is goin' to cost you a arm and a leg

And all through the house
We had guns and money around
Layin' on the couch
Was dressed with black jewelry this time
Mmmmmm, c'mon

[Sticky Fingaz]
Everybody want me, I created thieves
Why I'm almost as important as the air you breathe
I been through hard times, when it wasn't enough for me
Stick a weak kid'll have you livin' in luxury
I'm the reason niggas sellin' drugs to fiends
I'm the reason Mr. Simpson got off clean
I'm the reason some parents gotta bury they kids
And I'm the reason why your cousin on the run from feds
I've been through customs, borders
I've been handled by authorities
Drove people crazy when they couldn't see more of me
I've been saved, I've been buried alive
Say my name enough and any nigga testify
Who you think lead that whole seller ass that time
All by myself, I created black on black crime
I'm America's most, I'm tadded up with Ghostt
Even my hand got big, from net to gross
I'm emotionless, yet I breathe jealousy and envy
People kill for me or die to defend me
But in the end am I really worth the sun
Rich people make me work for them
And poor people work for me
Who am I? Nigga I'm money
Who am I? Nigga I'm money

See the gun wound, went down for you
Who ran up in the house, duke
Caught one from he and for who
When niggas was ready to murder me
You stayed up in the crib, like a bitch
Lookin' ill, and it's lurkin' me (for who?)
I got stabbed for you
Yo, shot up the ass for you
Should stop blowin' the cabs for you (for who?)
Chill, some niggas called crabs for you
Holdin' them garbage bags for you
Ill, blowin them hags for you

I resort to evil, I don't grow on trees
I'm called by different names, chips, scrilla, cream
And I'm always green whether dirty or clean (Wooooeeee!)
Gettin' ya hands on me is the American dream
I'm more powerful than God, or Razale
Cause when you pray to God nigga, you pray for me
I'm an exchange hand to hand, with heavy weapontry
This one couple fucked on me, and slept on me
Up in the dice games niggas stepped on me
Bet on me, couldn't pay, bled on me
I enslaved populations, and controlled masses
I come in all forms, coins, paper, plastic
Even credit, I owe you
You work for me nigga, I own you
If you are smart, you make me work for you
All ya life you try and get me and it's hurtin' you

If you had a million of me, what would you do with me yo?
Would you blow me in a month and have nothin' to show
Or would you invest in me and watch me grow
Take me to the streets and flip me from, do' to sto' to do'
I underseen things I wish I hadn't seen
I came between loved ones and families
A nigga kill his old man to get his hands on me
Got secret ensciptions, examine me
want to find me, the bank machine is where I be
And showed 'em to a hundred grand, F.D.I.C.
I'm more notorious than the B.I.G.

If it wasn't for cool Herc, hip hop wouldn't be created
That's bullshit, I would of created it tens years later
Niggas acting up till the guns is heard
I don't hear you poppin shit now, mums the word
And all you rapping niggas, what, that's all you got
Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac
Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it
And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it
But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest
I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest
Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulet
Just to collect, life is short expect my death
Told you once, told you twice
This is the last time you can boooooooop give me a flat line
Even if I bleed to death I can't die
Not even if I fell from ten stories high
Yo, I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying
No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron

I tried everything swallowed pills slit my wrist
Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin missed
Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed
At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran
I want it rawwwwww, and more than ten different women
Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'
As a kid, they had to watch me carefully
Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me
Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me
Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me
Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me
I walked amongst the dead
Talked to punks with lead
An eye for an eye
We can all go blind
All you niggas talking about you ain't scared to die
I feel nigga, cause I ain't scared to kill you nigga WHAT
I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying

Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..
 
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you

Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?
 
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware
 
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me
 
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?
 
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane
 
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same
 
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?
 
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets

The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using
 
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you
 
[Chorus]
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God
 
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?
 
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity
 
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain
 
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth
 
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?
 
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?

How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest
 
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?
 
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self
 
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?
 
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God",Oh My God

[Sticky Fingaz]
To all my sisters all across the world
I applaud you
I know can't nothing can't erase the pain we caused you
I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you
Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you
Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you
Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you
Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed you
I was thinking ""Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?""
You never feel it, till it hits home
We abandoned you, left you all alone
With our babies in your hour of need 
Left you all by yourself to raise our seed
And all the times we made you go wild in court
And had to fight us just to get child support
There is only a handful of us that handle our responsibility
I'm from a broken home; know this shit is killing me
How a man can make a woman a mother and a father
If men got it hard, then women got it harder
And I represent every man on earth when I say this:
Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness

[Chorus- Choclatt]
Sister I'm sorry
For all the wrong I've done
Sister I'm sorry
I'm telling everyone
Sister I'm sorry
Nothing can change the past
Sister I'm sorry
Your forgiveness is all I ask

[Sticky Fingaz]
I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you
I ain't recognize the goddess that is the side of you
I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith 
Made me overstay, hope it's not to late
But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl
And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world
I don't want my child being ashamed of me
Like ""Mommy, where's daddy?"" Wonder what became of me
Swear to life I don't know how ya'll made it all these years
Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears
You my sister, I respect and love you
You woman, men came from you
And he came from she
All men ain't the man that they claim to be
Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me

[Chorus]

[Choclatt]
Sister, I'm so sorry
Please forgive me

I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry for hurting you
For mistreating you
For not loving you
I'm so sorry",Sister I'm Sorry
Sticky Fingaz,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones

Let me go grab sticky right quick

Hey yo stick, stick

Yo slim shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah
Well it wasn't a good (what was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (what?)
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white! (ohhh)

What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought o.j. was innocent (he did it)

If I was white
What if he was white?

Would I be redneck or skinhead, preppy or high class?
You probably live in a trailerpark and be white trash!
In any case that be the ill shit right? (yep)
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the n word without startin a fight (what's up my nigga?)
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit (how you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (nah, it's true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears when ever I heard hip hop (ah)

White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
(what if he was white?)

Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch tennis and golf and bet on hockey games (red wings man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a newport
Id live in long island instead of new york
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump (nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
'cause all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

What are wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I've seen friends shaking hands

Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac
Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it
And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it

But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest
I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest
Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulette
Just to collect, life is short expect my death

Told you once, told you twice
This is the last time you can bop give me a flat line

Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin' missed
Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed
At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran

I want it raw, and more than ten different women
Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'
As a kid, they had to watch me carefully
Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me

Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me
Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me
Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me
I walked amongst the dead, talked to punks with lead
An eye for an eye, we can all go blind

Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high

Leave you tongue-tied, mothers watch their young die

I'll be waitin at your crib for my money til the sun die
Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie
A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by
Squeeze this rap shit til the well run dry
I never spoke to one time not even one time
Look at my brain it's every rapper combined
I'm bout to OD on some shit like Sublime

Who are you to question, how I live
When the whole entire world is negative
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die

You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at

I'm a class act, got assets, where the ass at?
I do you like I did them niggaz on the last track
We like dice, if you gon' roll don't ass bet

that's what i told the judge in court at my arainment

chorus(x2) 

I sold everything from crack,to guns,to weed
keep the heat between my boxers and my dongeries
the whole business ran off supply and demand
wit dis i had a whole hood inside my hand
just taste it,swear your tongue be numb for a week
but try to jerk it,swear yo azz be unda the sheet
keep flipping it raw,keep sellin that weight
till they,kick in the door,its the american way
organized crime,infratated the force
we above the law,that's cause we paying em off
gave my debt to society,but where's my change
for when i went in,i came out worse or even the same
its the game of life
been like dis since the beginning
who could get the most cars,collect the best women
you can't judge nobody cause its all essence 
whoever die wit the most money in the end when

And when we come to a party you know the thing over
Blaow, shorty seem to just come to us
And wit that bangin ass body you know what we be doin
Word up, air it out, just give it to us
We ain't takin advantage, they said they want to do it
I gave drunk dick to her
You could ask her later what the Remi did to her
Like yo, when you hit them back four walls
Them back four walls make you collapse on all fours
Backslidin and grindin, furniture gon' fall
Rough sex in the bed, baby we could brawl

Ma, what you got in that denim?

I'm lookin at this girl, lookin at my women
It's lookin like she givin us signals to come wit her
Not sayin she dyke but look kinda bully
I'm just sayin some women today prefer women
Ain't nothin changed I'm the same crook
Tryna floss while I'm around get ya chain took
I snatch rocks and when I'm horny I snatch women
While them bitches runnin away I'm just playin wit 'em
I'm eatin you, you givin me head
When I blessed your bed when I spread your legs
While you moanin and groanin I'm hittin that ass
Wifeys, mothers and daughters be strippin for cash

[Chorus]
In these streets, where we from
We all caught in the game
Tryna pull our life out of the drain
If you don't make it, you the one to blame
In this life, that we live
We only tryna survive
It's hard with the blind leading the blind
Everybody here stuck in the grind

[Sticky Fingaz]
They said I was crazy, nigga sick in the head
Who raised me?  My mother was sick in the bed
How could you blame me?  On the block gettin that bread
They couldn't change me, too hot, dippin them feds
I made a promise, not to go back to jail
Under my garments, gun tuck, packin that steel
But reguardless, this nigga here is out of the field
Now my partners is only money, that's real
I got my mind made up, my shine ain't up
Until I'm in that casket, my time ain't up
Tell you bout my lifestyle, I'll walk you through
First mix the Louie wit the Johnnie-Walker blue
Now peep the hooptie, I'm followed by my crew
Hundred thou' in jewelry when the God come through
I kept it thorough with my ear to the streets
Now we gettin Cash Money without the gold teeth

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
I done seen pain, felt pain and lived pain nigga
Half my life in these streets down the drain
Analyze the game through the eyes of my father
Had to feel my way through with the revolver
That goes to tell you he ain't show me nothin
Mad at the world when they ain't owe me nothin
So I apply pressure, why not for more measure
And more cake, we turn hoods to whole states
For my real niggaz, dressed in greens is upstate
Trapped in that cold cell with no bail
We ain't mean to hurt nobody to get them dollars up
Half my niggaz goin dead'll push ya flowers up
I'm fresh out the county, with no shoe laces
They thought they could stop us with probation?
We just live on the run and switch up locations
Play the future by the air until it's time to face it

[Chorus]

(???)
Young niggaz stay hungry for war
Bred and raised by hustlers and whores
Born the struggle in this jungle, escape poor
While the White House got ten rooms with ten blind doors
I was born to fight for what's right, by the day and night
Prayin for life cause shit ain't tight in these streets
That's why I stay squeezin my heat
And strippin life from mammals
A hungry young hustler ready to gamble
For a better way of livin so fuck sittin in prison
Cause every niggaz a ? victimized by the system
Cops and cellblocks, why hell rots
Young thugs from Queens to ?
Slugs give shellshocks in these streets where funeral bells knock

Let's get it hot now baby
I keep it gully til I drop dead baby
I told you I ain't got an option baby
I came too far just to stop now baby
But yo yo

[Sticky Fingaz]
Yo we blowin 'em up, holdin 'em up
Swolen 'em up, gang signs throwin 'em up
All these guns don't make me have to open 'em up
I'll open you up, doctors be sewen you up
If you a soldier flags they gon' be foldin 'em up
Every month like PMS, I get the quote of the month
Like I give a fuck, I walk away holdin my nuts
Rollin a dutch, everything that's stolen I touch
Better lace your boots and cock ya fours
And give these niggaz what they askin for
Cause they ain't seen ya face in the streets for a while
Let 'em know you got heat and you puttin it down

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
A'yo no fuckin around, buckin around
Duckin 'em down, believe me son, shuttin 'em down
If you commercial put yo' ass under the ground
That's why your wife could never be found when I be in town
You probly taste me when you be tonguin her down
Cause I don't listen - she told me not to cum in her mouth
Thuggin her out, love don't live in this house
I'm talkin sex, money, murder ma that's all I'm about
You better grab her by the hair, slap her ass some more
And give these bitches what they askin for
Cause they ain't seen a nigga this live in a while
Let 'em know you go deep when you dickin 'em down

But yo, I don't know, where should I take her
To the edge water cliffs or back to Southside Jamaica
Bitches be like, I don't know, where they get they clothes from
Industry like, I don't know, where they get they flows from
Niggaz be like, I don't know, where they get they dough from
Posin up in the clubs with guns or wrist frozen
I don't know, nothin when the cops come, I act dumb

I don't know, how the hell I got home last night
I don't know, how I blew twenty g's in one night
I don't know, but all I remember's two hos from Virginia out cold like December
Neighbors be like, I don't know, how could they afford that crib they in
I don't know, what these boys do for a livin, shoot
I don't know, but it must be drugs cause they have wild parties and they dress like thugs
Ask myself but, I don't know, why I flooded the watch, flooded the chain
I don't know, why I copped the Benz at a hundred and change
I don't know, why I'm stuck in my ways
And took back the new Hummer when I seen the new Range
They all say

[Chorus]
[Sticky Fingaz]
Yo, where the money at? I don't know
What? You better tell me where the safe at, I don't know
Don't say that one more time, I ain't playin that, I don't know
Ugh, that's the last straw, cocked back the four, put his brains on the wall
I'm in the club and, I don't know, if these little groupies is givin it up
I don't know, should I try to spit game to her friend or just her?
I don't know, what the hell I told her
Though I took her home by the morn', ended up with both of them

[Fredro Starr]
A'yo it musta been God yo cause, I don't know
How we made it out of them projects
I don't know, should I cop the Benz Coupe or the drop Lex
I don't know, should I do it out of spite, twenty niggaz on the bikes, doin
wheelies to the lights
Hos was like, I don't know, I guess they from New York the way that they talk
I don't know, I guess she from L.A. the way that she walk
I don't know, on where you want to chill
Put your ass on the back and we could slide through the hill
Baby it's real, I don't know, on what you fools thinkin you musta forgot
I don't know, why your bitches call me fire, cause a nigga hot

You be just another nigga that they stick in the box
But we are the streets, what other choice we got?
Then to go hard, give them niggaz all we got
Fuck that, as long as I got breath in my lungs
I'm livin my life, waitin for my death to come
If you made it out the hood then God blessed you son
But if your fam there you ain't out lesson one
Gotta spread around nigga that's what's real to me

Take small step, big moves I make

Everyday Thanksgivin, for me two plates
Yeah we do grace, God bless it all
From the mess hall to the boulervard with the dead dogs
When we cough and spit, guns they speak
The same language is the bullets, who talkin shit?
Yo Pac if ya listenin they got the game twisted
Talkin bout the hate you gave little infants
Fuck everybody here today, place ya ways
And ya fade away like the memory of Gotti
Take it back to '90, last year highschool
Didn't graduate though, still had to make dough
That's my word, word for word I understood it all
Had big dreams though the hood is small

[Chorus]",I Love da Streets
Sticky Fingaz,"(featuring Geneveese & X-1)



This is as close you gon' get to the streets without gettin shot




[Chorus]
In the streets

Cock guns and bust yo' heat

In the streets

Where we live and die for beef

In the streets

Hos'll set you up, get blood on your sheets

In the streets

By any means we gon' eat

In the streets

Sellin drugs you might blow up

In the streets

They got hos to set you up

In the streets
Even police is corrupt


In the streets

There's a million niggaz just like us


[Sticky Fingaz]


I swear I ain't been the same since they had to bury my pops


I'm uncivilized like I was raised in a box
I'm told get your sister raped nigga makin you watch

Fuck the cops, fuck the world, I'm above the law
They can't catch me, what you think the gloves is for?


Got your ear to the street, you ain't hearin me

Motherfucker, the streets got they ear to me

Speak my name, better think careful duke

Like when clingin on to life who gon' be there for you?

Get blood on they seats, drive you to the hospital


I got an image to protect and records to sell
Nobody!!! Cause you goin to hell

Besides a one sided story is easy to tell

My poster on the wall only way you see me in jail

Sticky Fingaz nigga, the legend, the myth

Niggaz get shot everytime I shoot the gift



[Chorus]


[X-1]


I banged out in dorms and tore mouths off


While y'all run to cops as soon as it pops off
I can't respect lames when I'm knowin you soft

That's why I feel the pain for my thugs up north

No regrets in this world, not one care

No respect for this world without no peers

They did me wrong for years, I'm finally gettin back

Never sheaded a tear seein niggaz on they back

Lord knows it hurts to put his people in the dirt

Bullet holes in shirts and chumps buried in skirts

Prayin to God is hard, these streets don't play


But you gotta keep up your guard and hope the pain go away

I'm from where they shoot street lights out
And you gotta yell to talk over passin trains

And watch who you fuck with when passin 'cain

Cause them same fists'll get your wrists trapped in chains, nigga



[Chorus]



[Geneveese]

My killers move triggers and set firearms off

Smoke the type of blunts that set fire alarms off

One shot'll blow your face, chest and your arms off

Murderin Guiliani for all the pain that he's causin

Launderin dirty laundry through banks of corporate ?

Shit doctors can only calm me til the drugs wear off

One pump of the sawed-off and your squad'll be hauled off

Dropped her off in the car lock, locked in the trunk of the car

Shit's official, we spittin through government issue

40 automatic pistols rippin through brain tissue

Stuffin coke up wit your bitch I'll piss through

And a black on black lambo, puffin on A Line Of Crystal!
Under our politics, codes of the street


Never negotiate with killers with intentions of breach

Only associate with villains if you willin to bleed
Cause leakin'll get your mother hogtied and brutally beat

I'm gettin tired of the war stories, kid I heard 'em all
And before they could fake and make up another one that's false
I'ma take it and break it down, so y'all could knock it off
It's my call, in my corner they too soft
Mr. I-Don't-Give-A-Fuck, don't need much
But heat in the truck, weed in the dutch, beats I'm beatin 'em up
Streetsweepin 'em up, niggaz deals is suckers
More than the game, don't let the fame go to your brain
I'm still in the rain, where lives get caught in the drain
It's nothin to me, niggaz ain't fuckin wit me
I dump at your v and leave you niggaz slumped in your seat
Jump if it's beef, but wolves need somethin to eat
Nigga dollar signs cover my eyes, gucci material
Bottom line, hand on my nine wit no serial
First class flights and TV's is digital

You could bust guns and get it right homey
Up in the club, we came to get it gully
Smoke weed, drink henny, man get it ugly
Hard liquor for sure, cause we don't pop bubbly
Load up your steel, nigga dump it only
We don't talk, true story, all about our money
From the streets we ride, you know our style homey
If shorty want to bounce wit us then she out homey

Shit, cause it's all official
Load your pistol, I ain't right and I'm sure to hit you
Shoot through walls, you could die with your bitch too
So ladies, get out the way first
You gotta be kiddin dog, I got to spray first, nigga
Turn your promotional van into a hearse
Oh, bitches love the way I sit in the drop, pull up in the spot
They suck cock off the strength of the watch
Lil' homey, and that's alone
Fuck you got guns for if your gats at home?
You need to have 'em on your waste like me

Roofies and usually on two-three

No more all night parties all leave it behind
No more freaks living right
No more drama in the life
From now on its me and my lady just me and my baby

It starts going on tour the first time
Imagine the thoughts going threw a young rappers mind
Knowing your mine and couldn't give a fuck if you leaved
Things I did its hard for my self to believe
That that I'm sitting back thinking about smoking these trees
Girl you right I'm damn near ruined your life
The only one that was there at the end of the night
My vision was wrong guess what my bitch is gone
And you don't want me now that's why I'm flipping this song
Ignoring my calls daily fuckers you trying to scare me
Talking on the machine acting like you you can't hear me
Thuggin' it out to much I think its rap
Sending you gifts but god damn you sending them back
Killing myself like I ain't got know prize
Seeing your your face every time I close my eyes
Damn girl don't let this be the end of the ride

I've been around the world seen the best of woman
Bitches liking my style I guess it's the thug in them
I'm just living my life with no time to talk to them
Tired of dissing my wife 'cause niggaz we all do it
Hoes calling my cell you cursing about crazy
Got to know that you hate me probably ready to snake me
Like pulling up to the club one night
In my Benz with your friends and about to get right
Them birds they got nerve filling my mouth with words
Telling you that I don't car all night they in ya ear
Fuck what am I suppose to do I'm miles away from home
Heard in your voice your feelings over the phone
Those nights we had fights I tried to keep it calm
Throwing my shit outside on the front lawn

Left you for dead, you still alive, count your blessings
In the middle of the street holdin in your intestines
All they wanted was the money, you had to be dumb
Jumped for the gun, he blew off and punctured your lung
Your man came back and found you scrollin on the pavement
Grabbed you in his arms and said ""hold on son you gon' make it!""
Your vital signs droppin, your haloucinatin
""Somebody call the ambulance!""  If you live it's amazing
One still in your stomach, two went through your chest
Your boy tellin you ""don't talk son, save your breath""
The more you walk to the light the more it's hurtin less
You gettin nautious from the smell of burnin flesh
Cryin to God, think he can hear you beg?
Tears in your eyes, screamin ""I can't feel my legs!""

If you readin this, I'm probly dead by now
Probly ODed and put three in my head by now
I'm on the balcony alone, nobody here to stop me
I should film this and leave Banned From TV a copy
I'm sick of this world and everything that come wit it
Death, life, politics, religion, fuck all of it
Always feel the pain or I'm ignorin it
Could barely see the love but all we need more of it
Yeah right, like that's gonna happen
They workin on the next nuclear weapon
Niggaz still starvin, niggaz still robbin

And I'm not a quitter nigga, I ain't givin up

Far back as I could remember, had the lazy eye
All the shit I been through and I stayed alive
But today feel like a good day to die
Felt it before but it's hard to say goodbye
Felt like I'm talkin to myself when I pray to the sky
Like they took my faith and created a lie
Don't try to talk me out of it, I made up my mind
I'm a man, I meant no cry for help
So I'ma have to start the revolution by myself
I'm losin it, too much goin on in my head
Statistically speakin, I'm supposed to be dead

Old deal, slash by and competitive type
I'm better than Mike, the Jordans is up in the shelf
Next to a few rings and a couple of belts
Got a black widow chick, she be lovin me well
You could hate me, shit, cause I'm lovin myself
A glutton for wealth, these young niggaz fuckin they health
All excited over pussy, like it's somethin to sell
y'all dudes is geeks, y'all really don't influence the streets
The streets influence the slang that you fluently speak
Confusin to me, tryna be somethin your not
When them slugs pop you the one duckin them shots
I go hard like them youngins that be huggin the block
I go hard like Humphrey wit a glove and a glock
I'm somethin ya not, quite frankly you could love it or not
Certified number one nigga up in your spot

[Chorus]

[Rio]
A'yo remember Candy? White too dope camry
Big booty wit the small panties
Used to smuggle yay' for the homie Randy
Got the plushed out crib off the water in Miami
She almost had me, I was gone off the fatty
In love wit the way she called me daddy
Had she, known about the city where I'm from
And I ain't goin home til my bankrole's done
Motherfucker's think pimpins for fun
I ain't done til my greenery's weighin a ton
And we could smoke big weed, just lay in the sun
Hellafied when we ride, weed makin me buzz
Let's hit the room right after the club
That's what I'm here for

Sticky Fingers,"Caught between the bed sheets
I'm clinging on for my life
And now I know I can't sleep
I'mma laugh so much I cry
I stepped into the night
I'm not coming back no time soon
Gimme something to feel, gimme something to hold

Don't be standing on the sidelines
When we show up
Come along lets live together this is our town

We are just souls roaming
But you're not alone
Sinking my staggered heart
I was only trying to get home 
I was only trying to get home

I lost a friend but more than that
She lost her head and it brought me back
Ratta tat tat like that in the middle of the night
The ways [rays?] of the mirror and the shining gold
The words take the mirror and they go back home
Ratta tat tat like that in the early morning light

But how are you supposed feel when you got none, no
How could you be so cold?
Gimme something to feel, gimme something to hold

Don't be standing on the sidelines
When we show up
Come along lets live together this is our town

We are just souls roaming
But you're not alone
Sinking my staggered heart
I was only trying to get home 
I was only trying to get home

Please, please, please
Just live for the day
And take my praise
They can never say you don't try",Our Town
Sticky Fingers,"Fist tight wishing you're wonderful
Over the hill for now, forgotten
Departed sea and setting sun
And I have a dapper friend with a sinful love
Sucked in shark fin swim the boulevard
Chilli sauce sting chicken wing and a ghetto blast
Off and away with our seat belts fastened
Looking for a girl from a Chinese garden
I’m starved of thoughts of swords and lords
And women torn apart and all these snapper headed freaks
In all their dynasty red carpet stores (fist tight wishing you're wonderful)

Yes, it’s strange and I’m coming ‘cause I love your way
Broke up the party so you’d drive me something strange
Load me up and choke
'Cause I’m low, low, low, yeah

Caught up in a bad sitch'
You’re just acting with a massive smile
Got all of these actors who love action
Like they're Brad Pitt, Fight Club
Gonna come snatch her, to go rack some
Off that casper white stuff
(That’s not the vibe love not how you find love)
Coked up on that bad trip, to mount rat-shit
And its taxing right?
Normally you're active, you got passion
But you're passive, right now
'Cause of the antics, you're wrapped in
With these practiced guys, but
(That’s not the vibe love not how you find love)

Let's go let's dash quick, and then pack piff
Before we catch a flight
To tour the axis of the atlas, in the blackness of night
Wake up on a mattress, with mad spliff and acid
Kilpatrick oysters and snappers
Now dancing up on your catfish
Drink the wine and go intergalactic
Call NASA, in the atmosphere
Get lost in the magic, like Shaq did
In that classic era
Never come back to, this dull chapter
Don't have no fear
That’s a vibe, that’s a vibe, that's vibe

Yes, it’s strange and I’m coming ‘cause I love your way
Broke up the party so you’d drive me something strange
Load me up and choke
'Cause I’m low, low, low, yeah

Strange as I’m coming but I lost my way
Broke up beside you and I turn the other way 
Load me up and choke

Swapped boy scout hat for army cap

At the age of twenty-one, he's in Catch-22, all right!

He joined up for just three years, it seemed a small amount

That at the age of twenty-one he'd still have one to go?

When we started we thought we were great
Though nobody else agreed
Just you and I wasting our time
Playing and singing out of key

And they said we played too loud
'Cause we didn't play for their crowd
We just told them ""wait and see""

We had no money but still we went on
Trying to get some gear
A smashed-up cymbal and an old snare drum
Our financial state was clear

And they said we should give up
They said we didn't have a hope
And we still told them ""wait and see""

We worked harder, got better in every way
Got some other friends involved
Pretty soon we found we knew how to play
We'd got all our problems solved

But I swear to this day
I could see you drifting away
But I told myself ""wait and see""

Then came the day you said goodbye
We tried to smile but had to cry
You knew that you'd be missed
But we wished you all the best
But still we wished you would stay

Till then you were a part of everything
And everything that might have been
But now that everything has turned into what is
If you'd have waited you'd have seen

But you gave yourself the sack
Now there's no turning back
Now all your future's ""wait and see""

It's always bits of kids today
Broken cities, 'n' broken homes. 
Bits of kids who don't grow whole
Broken cities, 'n' broken hearts. 
Bits of people who fall apart

And it seems there's nothing anyway 
Not here in this town
Everything is only yesterday. 
And on the way down
And we're gonna be wrong.

That I don't want no more of that

And keeps you on the ground

The human shield protects your heart from being ground down

Dreams will all be shattered and your hopes dashed on the ground

And our friends will form a shield that works in every way

Stiff Little Fingers,"""We'd like to help you."" the consul said

""But there's nothing we can do

Well, you knew the risks when you took the job

After all you're not a fool
So, don't call me, don't call me


I just can't bend the rules


Keep your chin up, I know it's tough
Somehow you'll get through.""
It seems the Americans bargain and rescue


But if you get caught you're left to rot

Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon


(Chorus:)

Under a Beirut Moon


Sorry son, there's nothing we can do
Under a Beirut Moon



Different rules, we haven't got a clue


""We can't be seen to be giving in

To these terrorists you see

If we talk with them it would mean the end

Of all that we hold dear
So don't call me, don't call me


I'm doing all I can

Although it seems from where you sit

I don't give a damn.""

Back home they'll remember you in papers, on TV

Because when you're caught you're left to rot

Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon



(Chorus)



And though you dream of being free

There's not much hope that I can see


Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon


Now just today on the news I saw

A hostage walking free

He talked of how it came about


He gained his liberty
He said, don't give up, don't give up


Argue, beg and plead

Keep the pressure up, don't let it drop
Somehow you'll get free

He said the Americans would bargain and rescue

But when Brits get caught they're left to rot

Under a Beirut, under the Beirut Moon



",Beirut Moon
Stiff Little Fingers,"Oh it must be so romantic
When the fighting's over there
And they're passing round the shamrock
And you're all filled up with tears
""For the love of dear old Ireland""
That you've never even seen
You throw in twenty dollars
And sing ""Wearing of the Green

[Chorus:]
Each dollar a bullet
Each victim someone's son
And Americans kill Irishmen
As surely
As if they fired the gun

Now you've never stood on Belfast's streets
And heard the bombs explode
Or hid beneath the blankets
When there's riots down the road
No you've never had your best friend die
Or lost a favorite son
But you'll stand there and tell us
Just what we're doing wrong

Each false word a bullet
Each victim someone's son
And Englishmen kill Irishmen
As surely
As if they fired the gun

From the minute that you're born you're told
To hate the other side
""They're not like us, they're not the same
We know because we're right""
But can't you see we're all the same
There is no right and wrong
Why can't we stop and realize
Just what we're doing wrong
We've hated too much too long

Each old lie a bullet
Each victim someone's son
And Irishmen kill Irishmen
As surely
As if they fired the gun

How can you convince yourself
That what you do is right?
When people are dying there
Night after night
Don't you ever wonder
Why it still goes on?
The hopes and fears and all the tears
Are buried in your ground
Buried in your ground

Each rumour a bullet
Each victim someone's son
And careless talk kills Irishmen
As surely
As if words fired the gun

Well it's lasted for so long now
And so many have died
It's such a part of my own life
Yet it leaves me mystified
How a people so intelligent
Friendly, kind and brave
Can throw themselves so willingly
Into an open grave

Each new day a bullet
Each victim someone's son
And ignorance kills Irishmen
As surely
As if we fired the gun",Each Dollar a Bullet
Stiff Little Fingers,"I remember back so long ago
Where I went you'd always go
Never left my side, I never felt alone
Just you and me always on our own
Those were the days I loved but now it seems so strange
It's all so different I guess everything has to change

[Chorus:]
Johnny 7 now where are you
Johnny 7 help me see it through
Johnny 7 I need you right by my side
Was all so easy way back then
I pull the trigger just fire and end
No need to run Johnny 7 no need to hide

The years go by and you are gone
Never thought I'd miss you for so long
A world like this needs a seven too
I guess I'd still run back to you
They told me I'd forget as time goes by
But they can say what they want I know I'll never try

Could this all be a dream
So what I'll live my dream

I guess it's wrong to look back to you
What can you change what can you do
Is it so wrong is it all pride
Why pretend what I feel inside
But then I look around and I still want you back
I pull the trigger now - come on let's attack


",Johnny 7
Stiff Little Fingers,"When you're young you stand your ground
And nothing seem to get you down at all
Then you grow to realise
That everything ain't black and white, it's brown
On and on your life drags on and every day's the same

(Chorus:)
It's a long way to paradise from here
It's a long way to paradise from here

Every week you stand in line
You queue to put your name upon a form
And every week they have devised
Another way of making you feel small
On and on your life grinds on and you're not living at all

(Chorus)

You think you're tough, You think you're smart
But they know how to break your heart
They'll chew you up and spit you out and make you start again

(Chorus)



",Long Way to Paradise
Stiff Little Fingers,"Here's your mask 'nd here's your glove, it's all an arcade game
We call it 'Virtual Reality' so nothing's what it seems
Although we may want you to kill just do it now for fun
You play on the computer screen while these men load your gun
Men who only think of fortune no matter the price
Men who kill for sand and petrol never thinking twice

(Chorus:)
So let the young men fight, die in battle for the glory
And we know it's right so shoot son never worry
That your mother cries, she can't see the reason
Your battle cry is 'No surrender here at all'

Here's your mask and here's your gun it's no longer a game
This is absolute reality though it's not what it seems
We told you we need you to fight for freedom and for right
But what we want is our man restored, to hell with what he's like
Our man sells us oil and petrol at a price that's fair
Our man kills collaborators in the Public Square

(Chorus)

I believe in hopes and dreams, I believe in life
I don't believe in hate and greed, tyranny or spite

Might is right my will be done
I pull the trigger you fire the gun
No surrender



",No Surrender
Stiff Little Fingers,"It's time to ask yourself just what you want to be


Just look around tell me exactly what you see
No sitting out no chance to settle in your place
You're with us now don't be a name without a face




(Chorus:)

Stand up and shot for what you want to be



Stand up and shout what you believe
Stand up and shout for those you want to free
Stand up for the one and only



Get on your feet and raise your fist up for the count
No looking back you got to play the cards you're dealt


What's yours is yours if you will just stand up and shout


Break down the barricades and speak up for yourself

(Chorus)




Don't you know who speaks up for you


You can't rely on no-one else to pull you through


So what you're think might be what we want to hear

Don't keep it hidden got to shout your message clear
No easy answers when the question is self doubt


Better wrong than silent gotta let your feelings out



",Stand up and Shout
Stiff Little Fingers,"Always seems to be same round here
Town full of losers all crying in their beer
Nobody's willing to take any chance
Drown your brain in the rave machine dance, boy dance
You got one last shot here to change your world
Yeah, one last push just might make it work
But you sit on your arse watch your life drift by
Lookin' at you, tell me, should I laugh or cry
Why can't you realize it's all gone wrong
Why can't you see who's laughing now

[Chorus]
Baby blue baby blue
What have they been telling you?
Baby blue baby blue
What have they been telling you?

Ever day you toe the same tired line
Slave to your past you just serve your time
Stand and watch as it falls apart
They've taken your mind, your will and your heart
You got one last shot here to change your world
Yeah, just get out and make it work
But you're much too scared to take the risk
In case they put your name on their endangered list
Why can't you see that it has all been lies?
Why can't you hear them laughing now?

[Chorus x2]
I'm not the sort of man
To just leave well alone
I feel we're all owed
So much more

Now they're telling us the world's gone wrong
In fact it's been like that all along
Not just the ozone but the black coal seam
We're left with the sour milk 'cause there's no more cream
This is our last shot to change the world
Yeah, our last effort to make it work
But they are much too scared to commit their wealth
It's time to force some international health
When will they realize that now's too late?
I guess they never will somehow

Sometimes I know just what it's all worth
Sometimes it's fine
Sometimes it feels like Heaven on Earth
Then other times you scream at me
The hate freezes your soul
And it's cold
It feels so cold
It's so cold
It's cold

Sometimes we smile
Sometimes we sit there and laugh out loud
Sometimes we smile
Sometimes I'd try to seek you out in a crowd
Then other times I'd run a mile
Than see your face again
And it's cold
It feels so cold
It's so cold

Sometimes we talk
Sometimes we reason everything out

Stiff Little Fingers,"Well you snap to attention
And pay heed to what they say
'cause you know
That you please them all that way
And you don't need to think now
'cause your mind has gone astray
And they'll do your thinking anyway
And your head is full of ideas
That don't mean a thing

With your new sense of duty
And your brain washed shiny clean
It's time
To take your part in the parade
Yet you sound like your father
And I don't want to be mean
But did
You never want to break away?
And your head is full of answers
With no questioning
And your life is very simple
You won't let the outside in

(Chorus):
Won't you tell me
Why won't you get a life?
Are you scared of what feels right?
Won't you help me
Reach the meaning of you

Well it's hard for me
To understand how this can be
You're the same age as me
Yet you're older by years

Repeat vs 1

So I won't try to change you
You can carry on that way
But I hope
You come back to life one day



",Get a Life
Stiff Little Fingers,"I don't know how to say
I think that we should call it a day
It's easy to be your slave
But that's not the way that I want to behave

Believed you when you lied
Could stop you if I tried
Now I reach out for you just to stay alive

[Chorus:]
I want you

Won't miss you if you go
I'd kiss you adios amigo
Because now I understand
You make me an embarrassing man

Who people see as weak
Yet you play upon my greed
I wish you didn't satisfy my needs

Lost count of the times
I've forgotten my lines
And everyone laughed at the fool
So I put you on hold
Although it turns me cold
I'm sick of you calling the tune

I can't say this is the end
Because if we're no longer together
So I'm telling you ""never again""
Though I know that forever

",I Want You
Stiff Little Fingers,"You feel the damp in the evening air
You see them standing you feel them stare
You hear their insults you can hear them shout
You try to answer but no words come out
Your face gets hotter as the anger rise
You can see excitement in their eyes
As they free their aggression in the usual way
It's easier to fight
Harder just to walk away

The streets are empty as you're going home
You got your collar turned up against the cold
You're tired and hungry and and you're fit to drop
The rain is pouring won't it ever stop
You hear the voice from the alleyway
Saying:



",Walk Away
Stiff Little Fingers,"I'm sick of being pushed around
I'm tired of being forced back down
So all your dreams and your ambitions
Lie there on the floor
What if I want more
What if I want more
What if I want more
What if I want more

I'm fed up hearing



",What If I Want More?
Stiff Little Fingers,"Don't pity this poor immigrant
My eyes were open when I caught the boat
All I wanted was your shelter
And maybe just a little hope
But you turned your anger on me
For the courage that you lack
I don't want your half assed freedom
You can have the whole deal back
So now I'll tell you something
Let's get this straight from the start
Don't call me Harp
Don't call me Harp

You said:



",Harp
Stiff Little Fingers,"Just like the autumn
When leaves turn brown and fall upon the ground
That's how you left me
You just went cold and everything changed round
If I could have that time again
Would we still be friends
Or am I lying?

Chorus:
With everything I've said and done
And every race that I have run
When there is nothing more to say
I could be happy yesterday
With every lie that I've been told
And every dud that I've been sold
I would forget them anyway
I could be happy yesterday

Goodbye forever
You packed your bags and headed out the door
I'm being clever
Seeing if there's more points I can score
And though I'm sneering all the time
I'm dying inside
Do you remember?

I could be happy
Oh, so happy
I could be happy

I have no choice
I can hear you in the wild wind
I hear your voice

Can't believe it's over
I can't believe that I walked out the door

Led me to believe I knew the score

You always crucify me and look like you're having fun

You hate my friends you hate the hours I keep the job I do

Why should I explain myself when everything's alright

You take my dreams and smash them leave them broken on the floor

Arise!

You've listened to too many liars too long
And too many were your masters
You've got the chance here to right all the wrong
Don't squander it on disaster
You're standing in a bright new dawn
Got hope and belief enough for everyone
Got the opportunity in your hand
Now use it while you can

Arise!

People have written you off many times
But you are a great survivor
And though you have suffered some terrible crimes
I know it's just made you stronger
You're standing on your own two feet
Got a morbid past but you've got it beat
Got the key for living sitting in your hand
Now use it while you can

Chorus:
You've got to hold on
To how you feel today
This is the last train from the wasteland

Arise!

And cynics will tell you there's problems ahead
But you go ahead and solve them
They'll fill you with doubt and suspicion and dread
But your strength can overcome them
You got to face the critics down
Any fool can give in but you can't bow down
You got too many lives and futures in your hand
So save them while you can

(Chorus)

And every road that I've walked down
I know your streets I know your towns
I think I know the way you feel
So stand up strong and proud
Fear is not the answer
Arise!

And though this is only the start I know
How long they have kept you waiting
No matter how far down the road you go
The first few steps, a new beginning
So grab the future with both hands
Nobody said it'd be the promised land
But you can make it better than it's ever been
So change it while you can

(Chorus x2)

Arise!

Last train
Last train
Last train

Want to run away and hide

He's drinkin' supermarket cider
In a doorway in the town
And he's shouting 'bout the government
And how they let him down
He's got a sister lives in Brixton
Always tried to do her best
Yet she winds up broke and shafted
Just the same as all the rest

He's got a torn and greasy greatcoat
And a New York Yankees vest
And some strongly held opinions
That he must get off his chest
Yet his friends don't think about him
They all gave him up for dead
And they all got real embarrassed
About the problems with his head

Chorus:

Shout it out! (Shout it out with me)
Shout it out! (It's a mystery)
Shout it out! ('cause what I can't see)
Why he's invisible to them
Yet so obvious to me

He make his home in cardboard boxes
And the pigeons are his friends
And you cross over to avoid him
Never try to make amends
For the way that he's been treated
And we all must share the blame
And we never look him in the eye
And never ask his name

I thought we were past this stage
Never in this day and age
These things are still going on
Tell me where did we go wrong
I thought we had changed for good
Maybe I misunderstood
Does our new and caring nation
Only care for politicians
Those that have will all do well
All the rest can go to hell

Stiff Little Fingers,"Gill and Galloway were working late
On a summers night in '58
In a small town Alabama hideaway
In the U.S.A.
The two cops were knocking on the door
Of a young black boy
It was a quarter to four
They said:
""Hey nigger! Hit the floor.
You're about to be history.""

Pop Bickham was the young black man
He couldn't work it out, he didn't understand
But when they come with their guns you do what you can
So he picked up his rifle and he shot them down
They said he killed them in cold blood
And the jury they agreed
They said: ""you'll be sorry for what you've done""
And the whole town they agreed

Chorus:
They picked you up and they sent you down
A poor black boy in a rich white town
And for 38 years you never made a sound
That was half a life away

You see one of the cops had something to hide
He'd raped Pop's sister more than once or twice
And Pop wasn't going to let it go this time
So the cops had to take him out
But the courtroom didn't hear all of the story
They held back facts from the all white jury
No doubt what the verdict would be
Take him down, he's guilty

All because of hatred and bigotry

That you won't be beaten
And if you start to waver
Or you start to shake
Just stand up and be counted

When you're really just the same as all of us

The strain of the buying age
Believe me I know it for certain
That you can break from the cage
By holding your head high
Get a little self pride
Self respect on your side
And you'll find that all the doors fly open wide

(Chorus)

And all the problems at your door
Don't let them bother you no more
Just take them all down one by one

If you face them with head and heart
And what was hard doesn't seem so hard no more

I worry that it isn't real

Who tell me it's wrong to feel this way

Will get round to you later

Put the bastards underground
Buried every black in town
Who dared to raise his voice

They have to live their life in fear
Yet something makes them stand and shout
One day they will find you out
Dig up every fact in town
And shove them in your face

Stiff Little Fingers,"Don't think of tomorrow, do it today
Let's live our lives in yesterday
The lies you're spreading were dangerous then
I can't watch you spread them all again
You tell me we're more equal then other men I know
But your advice just can't be right and can't be left to grow

It's hard to reason, it's hard to see
Why you never learn from history
You came downtrodden and you learned to walk
And now you want to march before you talk
You're looking for a scapegoat a victim or a fool
And though you're free now that don't mean
You've freedom to be cruel

(Chorus:)
Don't give me opinions when you can't understand truth
I can't listen to a word you say, you haven't any proof
I believe in standing up for what I think is true
But you hand me all this hatred and I just can't believe in you

You're being twisted, you're being used
And you'll never see my point of view
You're kicking back now but can't you see
That what you're kicking ain't your enemy
You're taking easy answers, believing age old lies
Though once oppressed you're like the rest
And just as much despised

(Chorus)

Tell me all your problems, how you never got a break
And now you're free, you're telling me
That what you see you'll take

It's all so stupid, it's all so sad
That you've had to have the life you've had
That system's gone now, everything has changed
And there's no-one left to take the blame
You've got to start rebuilding, rewriting your own rules
Get it right don't end up like those bullet headed fools

Just passing time beneath the lights
Up in town and all alone
Got no business so minds his own

The hotel room is lonely and cold
He might as well go for a stroll
Idly looking in a hi-fi shop
Footsteps, a chuckle, and one hard slap

And they didn't even see his face
See him flinch or hear him groan
They didn't even see his eyes
One mean blow and on they ran

He put his fingers to his side
And felt his flesh was open wide
He felt the rent the blow had made
For the hand that fell had held a blade

And they didn't even see his face
See him stumble, hear his cry
They didn't even see his eyes
Just lashed out in passing by

What can it mean?
Who can make some sense of that?
Did it mean a thing to them?
What can make a mind like that?

Who can live life over his shoulder?

And flew safe home back to Belfast

You give me all your theories on life
How nothing that I say ever matters
And nothing that I do's ever right

You care for nothing at all

This is no laughing matter

You seem to have no spark only boredom
You seem to have no interest at all
You seem to think you're better than others
You seem to be just ripe for a fall

Nothing gets through at all

",No Laughing Matter
Stiff Little Fingers,"
It was a different world back then
Though not so long ago
I thought I understood most men
And now I just don't know
For all that I thought myself smart
I can't fix the rupture and break
In my achilles' heart

And all the certainties I had
Here all been washed away
It seems my world was built on sand
It vanished in a day
With all my beliefs torn apart
And I'm left with now are the shards
(of) my achilles' heart

What seemed like dreams are really nightmares
What seemed like fiction's really real
When my brain won't take in what my eyes say they've seen
Then we've surely reached the end

So although life must soldier on
A way of living now has gone
A right to freedom and to be
Has been denied to you and me
It's difficult but we must start
To undo the damage that's done
To our Achilles' heart

I saw a dead man walking
And he smiled at me
As he went on his way

And then he sang a song
Full of loss and longing
That's could break your day or make your day

In a crowd of laughing people laughing?

I'm hurt and I'm bleeding and I'm really scared
I don't wanna go back outside
Cause the bigboys are waiting and they'll get me one more time

And if we can't protect the weak
How can we call ourselves strong
Is the assurance that they seek
So beyond us all

Help me, someone, is anyone there?
This man asked directions and I said I'd help
Now I'm tied up and all alone
And I don't think he ever plans to let me
Go back home

And if we can't protect the young
How can we call ourselves grown
They place their trust in anyone
Only to lose it all

And when it happens we seem so surprised
Like we've not seen it all before
We wring our hands & cry
What do they do it for
What do they do it for
What do they do it for

Broken fingers & the phones too far
Can't even think now why I opened the door
Robbed and battered I've lost all pride
There was only enough cash to see that I got by

And if we can't protect the old
How can we call ourselves civilized?
And is the comfort they deserve
So difficult to provide?



",Protect and Serve

'cause there's a fire inside won't be denied
And I'm still burning see you'll never put the spark out in my soul
Still burning and injustice builds a bonfire in my core
Still burning.

If I turn my back on all the honesty you lack
Would that make me more mature?
By pretending to be blind, and accepting all your lies
I'd be giving in for sure
I won't acquiesce or take second best
I'm never satisfied 'cause there's a fire inside won't be denied
And I'm still burning you'll never put the spark out in my soul
Still burning and injustice build a bonfire at my core

Yet we can still lock a man away for 19 years
Having denied him the use of witness statements
That might have cleared his name
And we call that justice?

You gave me hope,made me believe
That what I did was right
You brought out a passion

Yeah you brought out a passion
That you never stopped giving

It's 'cause the companies get their own way
And all the young bands seem to say
Please turn our rebellion into money

So thanks for giving me my creed
I'll try to stay onside
Why'or helping me to dare to dream
After all this time
'cause I still see you up there
On a stage and playing
Yeah I still see you up there
I still agree with what your saying

Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you King?

So you believe your press
You think you're the greatest thing convinced you're the big Tam'

And it's time you got it straight, I hope I'm not too late so

Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you King?

Who died?
Who cashed their chips in and left you in charge?
Who died and made you king?

Now in the scheme of things
You're no more important than that guy standing next to you.
So stand up straight
And be what you ought to be and not what you think you are

Just be yourself
There's a lot more you'd get if you'd

You got someone who says
I'm guilty by my eyes
You got lie detectors
That you never use
But I'm the only person here
Who knows the truth

But you never hear my voice
Never listen when I talk
Made your mind up in advance
And I'm going to take that walk

Chorus:
You based your case on circumstance
That's all it was and ever will be
And I never stood a chance
The old boy network's stronger than me

My friends and relations
Never gave up hope
That one day you'd listen
And admit you're wrong
But the old school system
Turns another blind eye
And I'm so unimportant
That I might as well die

And you never hear my voice
Never listen when I shout
You put me in here long ago
And I'm never getting out

(Chorus x 2)

Now the truth has been unearthed
And opinion moves my way
You can't hold me in this prison cell
Not even for another day

And you have to hear my voice
Have to listen when I scream
And yet I wonder how you sleep
But if you do I hope you dream

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere 
Two of us together building castles in the air 
We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time the lovely long ago 
we didn't have a dime

Stig Rossen,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Stig Rossen,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Stig Rossen,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

About you playing doctor with that girl

Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

But his eyes caress her shoulders
While the coffee he bought gets cold
He watches her from behind
So she knows and she won't turn
But her hands shake
It's a shame she won't see the smile he wears
Cause it's only for her he smiles
I guess I knew from the start
He wouldn't play the main part
I guess I knew all along
He would appear in this song
Pretending this is a film
Now a close-up on her neck
And some soft lights
But the film will no reveal her voice
Cause this script doesn't have any lines
I guess I knew from the start
He wouldn't play the main part
I guess I knew all along
He would appear in this song
He watches her from behind
While her girlfriend gives advice
Doesn't listen
But her mind's obsessed with one desire
How she wants him to see her face
He watches her from behind
And that's all there'll ever be
And don't blame her
Another life or some other cafe
And they just might have found a way
I guess I knew from the start
He wouldn't play the main part
I guess I knew all along

From having nothing to having it all
From being in love to being poor
I skip that lipstick
I don't care what I wear today
My thoughts are with him
When I walk out in the street
People were staring
Then I felt my face was wet
I didn't notice I'd started to cry
I'm through with travelling
I know now what I was after
I stay right here now I've found
what I searched for
I know he doesn't love me
No he doesn't care much

Please let me take your car
Won't you please let me take your car""

Not on duty but they stopped

Bravely they pulled her off

He was my love, my love is no more.

Out in the garden,
I'm picking roses, how could he not
The more he picked and the more he pulled,
Until I gathered an apron full.

She climbed on yonder hill above
To give a rose unto her love.
She gave him one, she gave him three
She gave her heart for company.

And as they sat on yonder hill
His heart grew hard, so harder still.
He has two hearts instead of one.
She says, 'young man, what have you done? '

'how foolish, foolish you must be
To think I love no one but thee.
The world's not made for one alone,
I take delight in everyone.'

A stony pillow for his head.
He lay his head down, no word he spoke

Loves you, so I will love you too""
Lori Glory
In the back seat of a cab
Did I dream that you kissed me?
Lori, I'm so sad
Men claim the right of living
Of climbing, fighting and flying
They claim the right of living
So you became an expert on dying
Men took all the decisions
About what and why and how and when
You learned the part of refusals
And you played it very well
Lori Glory
Like a fly drawn to light
At all the bars where you took me
You were the queen of the night
Lori Glory
Why is there love
Why do we stand all this pain
When there's no help from above?
Lori Glory
My bags are packed
Our last walk across Manhattan
Such a balancing act
You gave me access to the world of hangovers
You were its irresistible Miss
You were the princess of leftovers
Of course you could spare a kiss
Lori Glory
My beautiful friend
Don't give up on me yet and
I'll stay with you 'till the end
Lori Glory
The girl that I like
Promise to fight harder
Next time they strike

Stina Nordenstam,"Sometimes it's all around you
Sometimes that love surrounds you
And even gone it's with you
Tasting of salt
He learned about love the hard way
She learned that nothing would stay
They knew all about love and nothing
Sharon and Hope
She says I like to kiss you
He says you'd better not
He's on the brink of loving
She's on the brink of falling
Maybe a month in Spain could do it for you
Or a fridge of cocaine could do it
Those are not ways to do it
For Sharon and Hope
Now that I met you nothing's the same
It's not going to be it ever again
If you stay or walk away
If I'm off or if I'm brave
Sometimes it's all around you
Sometimes that love surrounds you
We have it if we want to

Grown up just like you Lee

I was always prepared
That's what airports and stations are there for
I'd wave goodbye try not to stare
It's never too early
It's never too late
He spoke my name and his eyes glowed
His skin was like velvet from pain
I would have known him with eyes closed
See what I saw all the same
It's never too early
It's never too late
We see them all off at some point
We wave goodbye and we stare

Stina Nordenstam,"Me and Ron had the uniform on but we're not going to school
But the other way through the concrete grey
It was all OK it was cool
We took turns at laying an ear at the rail
We heard before we saw the faintest sound stead growing loud
We wanted nothing more
The laws of Silence Universe
We fight with high and fast
We fight with close and dangerous
With things that doesn't last
Ron and I got on alright
On the roof the speed was great
We made a turn and then came the tunnel
And all went dark as a grave
And the light came back and I saw the bridge
For a moment time stood still
It had started to rain, I noticed that
And then I turned and ran

No smoking allowed
Here it's so easy to burn yourself
And equally hard to survive

Here is wanting too much

You'll never know why

It happened again alright
Honey it makes me want to cry
Too late I fell out of bed
Hit the ceiling instead
I'd turned into a butterfly

God didn't spend much time
This was a hit and run
Clearly the wings were oversized
In all, nothing was right
Still it was quite a sight
I'd turned into a butterfly

But the last time I looked in a mirror
It looked like it was going to be fine
And the last time I looked in the mirror
It looked like it was going to be fine

Baby I don't know why
Wasn't I the average guy
And I was almost satisfied
To be just one in the crowd
Not too tall or too loud
I turned into a butterfly

Tired but always clean
Staying away from dreams
So I lie sleepless by your side most Nights
A twitch in my back
Gently life would attack
I'd turned into a butterfly

But the last time ...

Once past the drowning panic
And the longing to fly
Whatever I see in the mirror
I'm sure that it's going to be fine",Butterfly
Stina Nordenstam,"The end of a love affair
A scene from a film
Just as familiar
As the love had been

Before a word was said

Between us in the bed

The end of a love affair
The end of a life
The end of a love affair
Still we both survive

It didn't take so long
Really just a day
And all the hope was gone
It was clear I couldn't say

Getting up is easy
Beaten up, still easy
Cutting off is easy
Tearing down is easy

The morning belongs to the day
Already here with the grey
Already spilling with need
Already flooding with speed

With its hard spoken phrases, Neverending

Don't matter what side it lands on
So long as it's somebody else's dime""

It all feels the same

Guess all I can do is muster up some change

And take some dignity when I walk through this door

Catch a train
Got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

But really they are no different from me

They all have fear
They all have intense confusion
And no sweet moments that are clear
They all have aspirations
High hopes and dreams

I still see her dark eyes glowing

While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I watch your sea birds flying

We want our tea in the Sahara with you

I said to my baby this sounds like the ticket for you and I 
It said volunteers wanted for a very special trip 
To commune with Mother Nature on a big wooden ship 
We took a taxi to the river in case any places were free 
There was an old guy with a beard 
And every kind of creature as far as the eye could see 

This old guy was the boss  he said  ""I won't tell you no lie 
But there's more to this journey than is apparent to the eye"" 
He said he'd heard God's message on the radio 
It was going to rain forever and he'd told him to go 
""I'll protect you all don't worry I'll be father to you all 
I'll save two of every animal,  no matter how small 
But I'll need some assistants to look after the zoo 
I can't see nobody better so you'll just have to do"" 
I said, ""Just tell me something before it's too late and we're gone 
I mean just how safe is this boat we'll be on?"" 

""It's Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady"" 

It rained for forty days and forty long nights 
I'd never seen rain like it and it looked like our old friend 
Was being proved right 
We had no time to worry though there was just too much to do 
Between the signified monkey and the kangaroo 
We had to wash all the animals we had to feed them too 
We were merely human slaves in a big floating zoo 
She said, ""Hey baby I don't mean to be flip 
But it seems this old man is on some power trip"" 
I said, ""No,  no sugar you must be wrong 
I mean look at the size of this boat we're on. 
We're as safe as houses, as safe as mother's milk 
He's as cool as November and as smooth as China silk 
He's God's best friend, he's got a seat on the board 
And life may be tough but we're sailing with the lord."" 

Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady

Woke up this morning and something had changed 
Like a room in my house had just been rearranged 
She said, ""It's stopped raining and I know the guy's kind 
But if we stay here much longer I'm gonna lose my mind."" 
So we said we had a mission for his favorite dove 
To see if there was any mercy from this great God above 
So to find dry land,  away the white bird flew 
We didn't need no country just a rock would do 
When the dove came back to us he threw down a twig 
It was manna from heaven and meant we could blow this gig 
""But the rock's too small, "" he said, ""can't you see?"" 
I said, ""It's just perfect for her, it's perfect for me.""

Sting,"Well in a hundred years from now
They will attempt to tell us how
A scientific means to bliss
Will supersede the human kiss
A sub atomic chain
Will maybe galvanize the brain
A biochemic trance
Will eliminate romance
But why ever should we care
When there are arrows in the air
Formed by lovers' ancient art
That go straight to my heart
A future sugar coated pill
Would give our lovers time to kill
I think they're working far too much
For the redundancy of touch
But what will make me yours
Are a million deadly spores
Formed by lovers' ancient art
That go straight to my heart
Come into my door
Be the light of my life
Come into my door
You'll never have to sweep the floor
Come into my door
Be the light of my life
Come into my door
Come and be my wife
I'll be true. To no one but you
If it's a future world we fear
We have tomorrow's seeds right here
For you can hold them in your hand
Or let them fall into the sand
But if our love is pure
The only thing of which we're sure
Then you can play your part
And go straight to my heart
If I should seek immunity
And love you with impunity
Then the only thing to do
Is for me to pledge myself to you
But they only dealt one card
So for me it is not hard
You're the bright star in my chart
You go straight to my heart
Come into my door
Be the light of my life
Come into my door
You'll never have to sweep the floor
Come into my door
Be the light of my life
Come into my door
Come and be my wife

Crumbling towers in beams of yellow light.
No flags of truce, no cries of pity;
The siege guns had been pounding through the night.
It took a day to build the city.
We walked through its streets in the afternoon.
As I returned across the fields I'd known,
I recognized the walls that I once made.
Had to stop in my tracks for fear of walking on the mines I'd laid.

And if I've built this fortress around your heart,
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire,
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm,
And let me set the battlements on fire.

Then I went off the fight some battle that I'd invented inside my head.
Away so long for years and years,
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead.
While the armies are all sleeping beneath the tattered flag we'd made.
I had to stop in my tracks for fear of walking on the mines I'd laid.

And if I've built this fortress around your heart,
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire,
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm,
And let me set the battlements on fire.

This prison has now become your home,
A sentence you seem prepared to pay.

Sting,"I looked out across the river today.
Saw a city  in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play.
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light,
Two priests on the ferry.
October geese on a cold winter's night.
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.
 
Two priests came 'round  our house tonight,
One young, one old,  to offer  prayers for the dying to serve the final rite.
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows.
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows.
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.
 
If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man.
I'd bury him at sea.
 
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth.
Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of the needle.
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing.
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
All this time the river flowed endlessly like a silent tear.
 
All this time the river flowed.
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?
Yeah  yeah.  Yeah yeah.  Yeah yeah.
 
Teachers told the Romans  built this    place.
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town.
They lived and they died. 
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound.
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left 
Were the stones the workmen found.
All this time the river flowed in the falling light of a Northern sun.
If I had my way, take a boat from the river.
Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one.
One by one. One by one by one.  One by one.

He'd drink every night and he'd dream of a future

Soon came a day when the bottle was broken

Caught in the flare of acetylene light

A Pope claimed that he'd been wrong in the past

When popular icons failed

I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon

I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?
They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet

A vintage that blessed every ship in the line 
It's wrung from the blood of the sailors who died 
Young white body adrift in the tide'

Black sail in a pale yellow sky 
And just as before in a moment  
It was gone where the grey gulls fly. 

If it happens again I shall worry 
That only a strange ship could fly 
And my sanity scans the horizon 
In the light of the darkening sky. 

That night as I walked in my slumber 
I waded into the sea strand 
And I swam with the moon and her lover 
Until I lost sight of the land 

I swam till the night became morning 
Black sail in a reddening sky 
Found myself on the deck of a rolling ship 
So far where no grey gulls fly 

All around me was silence 
As if mocking my frail human hopes 
And a question mark hung in the canvas 
For the wind that had died in the ropes 

I may have slept for an hour 
I may have slept for a day 
For I woke in a bed of white linen 
And the sky was the colour of clay. 

At first just a rustle of canvas 
And the gentlest breath on my face 
But a galloping line of white horses 
Said that soon we were in for a race 

The gentle sigh turned to a howling 
And the grey sky she angered to black 
And my anxious eyes searched the horizon 
With the gathering sea at my back 

Did I see the shade of a sailor 
On the bridge through the wheelhouse pane 
Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship 
As I squinted my eyes in the rain 

For the ship had turned into the wind 
Against the storm to brace 
And underneath the sailor's hat 
I saw my father's face 

If a prayer today is spoken 
Please offer it for me 
When the bridge to heaven is broken 
And you're lost on the wild wild sea 
Lost on the wild wild sea...",The Wild Wild Sea
Sting,"I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look, having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh, ahh, ahh

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die

Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

Sting,"You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy Church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse, but
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse, but

There'd be nothing left for me to do",Prologue (If I Ever Lose My Faith in You)

Sting,"We rode all night across an endless desert
We had no moon to light our way
And though a million stars were slowly turning
We lacked the consciences to pray

Our horses running like a devil chase us
Their feet, they hardly touched the ground
Yes, I'm familiar with a grey wolf howling
But I'm certain I never heard that sound
Devil to pay on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?
This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

I've been the lowest of the low on the planet
I've been a sinner all my days
When I was living with my hand on the trigger
I had no sense to change my ways
The preacher asked if I'd embrace the resurrection
To suck the poison from my life
Just like an existential cowboy villain
His words were balanced on my knife
Devil to pay, on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?

This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

Every night
Every night
All my distances afar

This cowboy song, is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
This cowboy song, this cowboy life
I'll be your dog-star shining tonight

Sting,"I've been working too hard at the office all year
I've been saving all my days for a break
And I've got to get away with my baby for a time
If it's just for my sanity's sake

Nothing but work and never to play
Make Jack a dull boy or so they say
And nothing in the world gonna make me stay
I've just got to get away for a day

Oh the smog in the city is clogging up my head
And the noise of the traffic and the poison lead
Too many people I must confess
I'm looking for the cure of terminal stress

Take me to the sunshine
Take me to the sun

It's a perfect paradise and it ain't no trick
You can walk, you can run, play golf 'til you're sick
Swim all day, you can dance all night
You can ever fall in love if you're feeling right

The surf will roar and the birds will sing
And the warm wind sighs as you practice your swing
And the cares of the world will fade away as you
Watch the sun setting on a golden bay

They say that modern man needs to find himself
And what's bad for his spirit is bad for his health
And when the world's used up and there's nowhere else
You'll realize Mother Nature is the Commonwealth

Sting,"Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
And she shows her face to ask me how I am.
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me,
Maybe I could come and babysit sometime.

She says ""Are you ok? I was worried about you,
Can you forgive me?  I hope that you'll be happy.""
I said ""I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm so happy, I'm laughing through my tears.""

I saw a friend of mine.  He said ""I was worried about you,
I heard she had another man.  I wondered how you felt about it""
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears.

Saw my lawyer, Mr. Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation.
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.

I can't stop crying, I'm laughing through my tears,
I'm laughing through my tears.

I took a walk along last night, I looked up at the stars,
To try and find an answer in my life.
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him,
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.
Something made me smile, something seemed to ease the pain,
Something 'bout the universe and how it's all connected.

The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream.
We try to do the best within the given time.
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that,
What can a father do but babysit sometimes.

I saw that friend of mine, he said ""you look different somehow.""
I said ""everybody's got to leave the darkness sometimes.""
I said, ""I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.""

I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

I walked on the banks of Tyne
I wondered how I could win you
Or if I could make you mine
Or if I could make you mine
The wind it was so insistent
With tales of a stormy south
But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree
There came a dryness in my mouth
Came a dryness in my mouth
For then without rhyme or reason
The two birds did rise up to fly
And where the two birds were flying
I swear I saw you and I
I swear I saw you and I
I walked out this morning
It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes
For the first time I saw the work of heaven
In the line where the hills had been married to the sky
And all around me every blade of singing grass
Was calling out your name and that our love would always last
And inside every turning leaf
Is the pattern of an older tree
The shape of our future
The shape of all our history
And out of the confusion
Where the river meets the sea
Came things I'd never seen
Things I'd never seen
I was brought to my senses
I was blind but now that I can see
Every signpost in nature
Said you belong to me
I know it's true
It's written in a sky as blue
As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes
If nature's red in tooth and claw
Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw
The wounds she gave me
Were the wounds that would heal me
And we'd be like the moon and sun
And when our courtly dance had run
Its course across the sky
Then together we would lie
And out of the confusion
Where the river meets the sea
Something new would arrive
Something better would arrive

Cross in the sky  star of the sea

Under the moonlight  there she can safely go
Round the Cape Horn to Valparaiso

And every road I walked would take me down to the sea
With every broken promise in my sack
And every love would always send the ship of my heart
Over the rolling sea

If I should die
And water's my grave
She'll never know if I'm damned or I'm saved
See the ghost fly over the sea

Under the moonlight, there she can safely go
Round the Cape Horn to Valparaiso",Valparaiso

Were to put me on time 

Just a year to the day 
Since I went upon my way 
To seek my fortune and fame 
Be a star  change my name 
And that's it more or less

She'll just go marry Jack

We were lucky we got paid

Will be yours this I vow

When drugs and booze ate all my dough 
This isn't how it was meant to be

Sting,"Another night finds me alone
In my dreams
You still touch me
Your picture by my telephone
In that smile
You still thrill me
Now if I sleep, I sleep here alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
And if I'm falling
I'm falling like a stone
In my nightmares
You still hold me
And after all that we've been through
Now I'm wondering
If you still blame me
If only half of this was true
That you believe of me
You still shame me

I close my eyes
I seem to hear the raindrops saying
You won't come back

Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise

Hush child,
I can help the look of accusation in your eyes
In your eyes

All in sorrow
Wise men hang their heads

Sting,"Sometimes in the light at the edge of the world
Is the ghost of a ship with it's dark sail furled
And night after night she would stand on the shore
And dream of the love that she knew before

The tide rolls out, the tide rolls in
Without a thought for the ways of men

He set sail for the Spanish Main
To rob the ships of the Queen of Spain
And she would be his pirate's bride
She gave him the pistol and the sword at his side

The tide rolls out, the tide rolls in
Without a care for the ways of men
I'd give three ships of Spanish gold
To see my love again

Full fathom five my true love lies
In a fine wooden casket no gold on his eyes
Where is the glory, where is the pride?
Where is the joy for this pirate's bride?

The tide rolls out, the tide rolls in
Without a care for the ways of men

Here in the light at the edge of the world
He'd wait for a ship with it's dark sail furled
And day after day he would stand on the shore
And dream of the life that he knew before

Sting,"The palace guards are all sleeping
Their fires burn into the night
There's a threat of rain on the dark horizon
And all that's left is a quarter moon of light
He climbs up through the darkness
No weapon but his surprise
The greatest thief in the high Sahara
Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies
All your money, your pretty necklace
This is my work on such a night
There's a storm coming over the mountain
I'll be gone long before the morning
After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You find that I've taken nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
He was as gentle as the night wind
As no lover had been before
And the rings she wore for her bride groom
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor
Take me with you, take me with you
Before my lonely life is set
I've been promised to another
To a man I've never even met
After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
After the thunder's spoken, and
After the lightning bolt's been hurled
After the dream is broken, there'll
Still be love in the world
She said take me to another life
Take me for a pirate's wife
Take me where the wind blows
Take me where the red wine flows
Take me to the danger
Take me to the life of crime
Take me to the stars
Take me to the moon while we still have time
After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
After the thunder's spoken, and
After the lightning bolt's been hurled
After the dream is broken, there'll
Still be love in the world
",After The Rain Has Fallen
Sting,"I sat down and wrote this letter
Telling you that I felt better
Since you'd gone and I was free
I'm so happy
I have so little time to spare now
I'm wanted almost everywhere now
I make out like Casanova
Friends are always coming over
Signed my name as if I meant it
Sealed it with a kiss and sent it
The letter had improved my mood
Happy in my solitude
But halfway home I changed my tune
And when I saw my lonely room
The mirror caught my eye
When I sit down I cry
Big lie small world
Big lie small world
I had to intercept that letter
Telling you that I was better
I raced to catch the postman's van
He was leaving as I ran
I miss the bus I miss the train
I end up walking in the rain
Big dog chased me down the street
I hadn't had a bite to eat
Feeling sorry for myself
Wishing I was someone else
I walked across the city
'Cause I couldn't stand your pity
Big lie small world
Big lie small world
The place you live looks opulent
And obviously a higher rent
Than our cozy little room
I had this sense of doom
The landlord says you're out of town
That your new boyfriend's always around
The hour was getting late
So I sit down and wait
Here's the postman with my letter
Coming down the path, he'd better
Give that thing to me
I have to make him see
Begging doesn't do the trick
He thinks that I'm a lunatic
And then who comes upon the scene
But your new boyfriend Mr. Clean
I hit the postman, hit your lover
Grabbed the letter ran for cover
The police arrived in time for tea
Said they'd like to question me
I can only curse my fate
I have to face the magistrate
It hasn't been the best of days
I'd like to fly away
Big lie small world
Big lie small world",Big Lie Small World
Sting,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?
Love is pain I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day
It could happen to you,
Just like it happened to me,
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee.
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mac
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
We're starting up a brand new day
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
And go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day",Brand New Day
Sting,"I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall",Desert Rose
Sting,"The fox is done running
And the beast is at bay
We've run them in circles
By the end of the day
We chased them through bramble
We chased them through the fields
We could chase them forever
But the fox would not heel
And some saw her shadow
On the crest of a hill
All the hounds are distracted
Away from the kill
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
And we'd lay down our heads just like we were sleeping
Controlled by the drag of the moon
We ran through the forest
And we ran through the streams
And we ran through the heather
Though we ran in our dreams
And you were my lover
And I was your boy
We ran like the river
For what else did we know
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
The dogs are all howling
And the horses are late
All the hunters have hunted
Through the end of the game
Our love was a river
A wild mountain stream
In a tumbling fury
On the edge of a dream
And they chased us through bramble
And they chased us through the fields
They could chase us forever
But our heart would not yield
And the fox is done running
At the end of the day
I'm ready to answer
I'm ready to pay
And this river's done running
And time will come soon
Carried to the great ocean
By the drag of the moon

Sting,"Mobil station where I stand
This old gas pump in my hand
My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel
Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel
Here comes a big shot from the city
V8 engine, she runs so pretty
'Fill her up son, unleaded
I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'
Up in the front seat a pretty red head
'We're going to Vegas we're gonna get wed'
'So fill her up son, don't be staring
That's a real diamond she be wearing'
I'm gonna take my baby one day
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm going find some money all right
See those tail lights heading west
I got no money to invest
Got no prospects, no education
I was lucky getting a job at this gas station
That old cash box on the top shelf
The boss is sleeping, I'll just help myself
Let's consider this as just a loan
I can sort it out later on the phone
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home
And as I head through the woods on the way back
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven
And there's music playing
This money is cold in my hand
And a voice somewhere is saying
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing
And what real happiness can it bring?'
You're gonna fill her up with sadness
You're gonna fill her up with shame
You're gonna fill her up with sorrow
Before she even takes your name
You're gonna fill her up with madness
You're gonna fill her up with blame
You're gonna live with no tomorrow
You're gonna fill her up with pain
You're gonna fill her up with darkness
You're gonna fill her up with night
You gotta fill her up with Jesus
You gotta fill her up with light
You gotta fill her up with spirit
You gotta fill her up with grace
You gotta fill her up with heaven
You got the rest of life to face
You gotta fill her up the right way
You gotta fill her up with care
You gotta fill her up with babies
You gotta fill her up and swear
You're gonna love that girl forever
You're gonna fill her up for life
You're gonna be a loving husband
She's gonna be your loving wife
You gotta fill her up with gladness
You gotta fill her up with joy
You gotta fill her up with love
You gotta fill her up with love

Sting,"I watch the western sky
The sun is sinking
The geese are flying south
It sets me thinking
I did not miss you much
I did not suffer
What did not kill me
Just made me tougher
I feel the winter come
His icy sinews,
Now in the firelight
The case continues
Another night in court
The same old trial
The same old questions asked
The same denial
The shadows closing round
Like jury members
I look for answers in
The fire's embers
Why was I missing then
That whole December?
I give my usual line,
I don't remember
Another winter comes
His icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine
These memories never sleep
And all these differences
A cloak I borrowed
We kept our distances
Why should it follow that
I must have loved you?
What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
Never could find a place to hide
What moves the earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail
A mast without a sail
The moon's a fingernail
And slowly sinking
Another day begins
And now I'm thinking
That this is indifference
Was my invention
When everything I did
Sought your attention
You were my compass star
You were my measure
You were a pirate's map
Of buried treasure
If this was all correct
The last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests
It's time that I confessed
I must have loved you
I must have loved you
",Ghost Story
Sting,"I've had a question that's been preying on my mind for some time
I won't be wagging my tail for one good reason
It has to be a crime

This dog house never was the place for me,
Runner up and second best just ain't my pedigree
I was so happy, just the two of us
Until this alpha male
Turned up in the January sale

He won't love you
Like I love you
It won't be long now before that puppy goes astray
And what I like about this guy the most
He'd be my favourite lamp post
Devil take the hindmost

Je sais que c'est dur, mais il faut se faire au changement, tu vois
J'ai négligé le primordial pendant trop longtemps crois moi
Je suis consciente, je vois bien que tu souffres, mais ça s'attenuera
Car c'est d'un homme plus d'un chien dont j'ai besoin près de moi
Cesse donc de grogner, mon choix est fait c'est comme ça
N'en fait pas trop, ton attitude risque de t'éloigner de moi
Faut que tu comprennes, puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que ça
Désormais nous sommes trois, lui toi et moi

It's a shaggy kind of story
Would I tell you if I thought it was a lie?
But when the cat's away the mouse will play,
I wouldn't dish around here
There's something fishy 'round here

I howl all night and I sleep all day
It takes more than biscuit, baby, to chase these blues away
I've got a long enough leash
I could almost hang myself
It's a dogs life loving you baby
But you love someone else
Now he's moved by basket
I'd like to put him in a casket
I'll wear my best collar to his funeral

Ta mauvaise foi, j'aimerais bien que ça s'arrête
Me séparer de toi, aujourd'hui ça trotte dans ma tête
Moi non, j'en peux plus, tu n'est qu'un chien, c'est trop bête
La situation m'avait pourtant l'air d'être des plus nettes
C'est clair, que je l'aime c'est un fait, ton egoïsme m'inquiète
Après toutes ces soirées passées seuls en tête à tête
Chaque chose a une fin, et c'est la fin de la fête
Pour toi, car bientôt il n'y aura plus que lui et moi, lui et moi.

To have found this perfect life
And a perfect love so strong
Well there can't be nothing worse
Than a perfect love gone wrong

I'd always be your boy
I'd be your faithful companion
And I would follow you through every thick and thin

And we don't need him",Perfect Love...Gone Wrong
Sting,"A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame,
This single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid
'Til you love me",A Thousand Years

The lights have yet
To shed their tawdry lustre on the scene

My tights have run
These new heels are killing me

It's a slow night but there's time yet
Here comes John from his other life
He may be driving to his wife
But he'll slow down take a look
I've learned to read them just like books
And it's already half past ten
But they'll be back again

I check, make sure it's not the heat
I wink, I smile, I wave my hand

The small transaction we must make
I tell him that my heart will break
If he's not a generous man
I step into his van
They say the first is the hardest trick
And after that it's just a matter of logic
They have the money I have the time
Being pretty's my only crime
You ask what future do I see
I say it's really up to me
I don't need forgiving
I'm just making a living
Don't judge me
You could be me in another life
In another set of circumstances
Don't judge me
One more night I'll just have to take my chances
And tomorrow we'll see
A friend of mine he wound up dead
His dress was stained the colour red
No next of kin no fixed abode
Another victim on this road
The police just carted him away
But someone took his place next day
He was home by thanksgiving
But not with the living

You could be me in another life
In another set of circumstances

One more night I'll just have to take my chances
And no it's just not in my plan
For someone to care who I am
I'm walking the streets for money
It's the business of love, 'hey honey'
C'mon, don't leave me lonely, don't leave me sad
It'll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had

So I sit down and wait

Here's the postman with my letter
Coming down the path he better
Give that thing to me
I have to make him see

Begging doesn't do the trick
He thinks that I'm a lunatic
But then who comes upon the scene
But your new boyfriend, Mr. Clean

I hit the postman, hit your lover
Grabbed the letter, ran for cover
The police arrived in time for tea
They said they'd like to question me

But I can only curse my fate
I had to face the magistrate
It hasn't been the best of days
I'd like to fly away

Sting,"The palace guards are all sleeping 
Their fires burn into the night 
There's a threat of rain on the dark horizon 
And all that's left is a quarter moon of light

He climbs up through the darkness 
No weapon but his surprise 
The greatest thief in the high Sahara 
Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies

All your money, your pretty necklace 
This is my work on such a night 
There's a storm coming over the mountain
I'll be gone long before the morning

After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes 
You find that I've take nothing, that 
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye

He was as gentle as the night wind 
As no lover had been before 
And the rings she wore for her bride groom 
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor 

Take me with you, take me with you 
Before my lonely life is set 
I've been promised to another 
To a man I've never even met

After the rain has fallen 
After the tears have washed your eyes 
You'll find that I've take nothing, that 
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
After the thunder's spoken, and
After the lightning bolt's been hurled 
After the dream is broken, there'll 
Still be love in the world

She said take me to another life 
Take me for a pirate's wife 
Take me where the wind blows 
Take me where the red wine flows 
Take me to the danger 
Take me to the life of crime 
Take me to the stars 
Take me to the moon while we still have time

After the rain has fallen 
After the tears have washed your eyes 
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that 
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye

After the thunder's spoken, and 
After the lightning bolt's been hurled
After the dream is broken, there'll 
Still be love in the world 
Still be love in the world",After the Rain Has Fallen [Tin Tin Out Mix]
Sting,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?

How many lonely, sleepless nights 
How many lies, how many fights 
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?

""Love is pain,"" I hear you say 
Love has a cruel and bitter way 
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain

How could it be that what you need the most 
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking 
Through an old book in rainy weather 
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together 
You could be walking down the street 
And who should you chance to meet 
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money 
We're starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back 
I'm thinking in a brand new way 

Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her 
Starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across 
Started up a brand new day

It could happen to you - just like it happened to me 
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it 
And sometimes no reflection is there

Baby wait a minute, wait a minute 
Wait a minute, wait a minute 
Wait a minute, wait a minute 

Turn the clock to zero, honey 
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money 
We're starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero, Mac 
I'm begging her to take me back 
I'm thinking in a brand new way 

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across 
Started up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero buddy 
Don't want to be no fuddy duddy 
Started up a brand new day

I'm the rhythm in your tune 
I'm the sun and you're the moon 
I'm a bat and you're the cave 
You're the beach and I'm the wave 
I'm the plow and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station 
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl 
Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Starting up a brand new day

I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train

Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl 
Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Starting up a brand new day

You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We'll go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day",Brand New Day [Cornelius Mix]
Sting,"How like the fall
To be gone in a day
Just as the leaves had turned gold
I was drawn to the sound
That the wind carried down
From an open window pane
And oh, how like a song
Or a sad melody
To linger long after the end
And the harmony rings
With the promise of spring
On a Brooklyn street

How like the fall to be gone in a day
Just as the trees had turned gold
I was drawn to this sound
That some fingers had found
But now the winter seems to stay too long
How like a song
Or a sad melody
To linger long after it's gone
Though the window is closed
And the questions it posed
On a Brooklyn street

How like the spring
To return in a day
When everything seems to be new
But here's someone who's hoping
The window is open
On that Brooklyn street again
And oh, how like a song
Or a sweet melody
To linger long after it's gone
Let the harmony ring
With the promise of spring
On a Brooklyn street",Dienda
Sting,"If you need somebody, call my name
If you want someone, you can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
You got to lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me

If you love somebody, set them free

If it's a mirror you want, just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy, someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever want to be

If you love somebody, set them free

You can't control an independent heart
Can't tear the one you love apart
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches, so many souls
Everything we see we want to possess

If you need somebody, call my name
If you want someone, you can do the same

Sting,"I've had a question that's been preying on my mind for some time
I won't be wagging my tail for one good reason
It has to be a crime

This dog house never was the place for me
Runner up and second best just ain't my pedigree
I was so happy, just the two of us
Until this alpha male 
Turned up in the January sale

He won't love you 
Like I love you
It won't be long now before that puppy goes astray
And what I like about this guy the most
He'd be my favourite lamp post
Devil take the hindmost

Je sais que see'est dûr, mais il faut se faire au changement, tu vois
J'ai négligé le primordial pendant trop longtemps crois moi?
Je suis consciente, je vois bien que tu souffres, mais ça s'atténuera
Car see'est d'un homme plus d'un chien don't j'ai besoin pres de moi
Cesse donc de grogner, mon choix est fait see'est comme ça
N'en fais pas trop, ton attitude risque de t'éloigner de moi
Faut que tu comprennes, puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que ça
Désormais nous sommes trois, lui toi et moi

It's a shaggy kind of story
Would I tell you if I thought it was a lie?
But when the cat's away the mouse will play 
I wouldn't dish around here
There's something fishy 'round here

I howl all night and I sleep all day
It takes more than biscuit, baby, to chase these blues away
I've got a long enough leash
I could almost hang myself
It's a dogs life loving you baby 
But you love someone else
Now he's moved by basket
I'd like to put him in a casket
I'll wear my best collar to his funeral

Ta mauvaise foi, j'aimerais bien que ça s'arrête
Me séparer de toi, aujourd'hui ça trotte dans ma tête
Moi non, j'en peux plus, tu n'es qu'un chien, see'est trop bête
La situation m'avait pourtant l'air d'être des plus nettes
See'est clair, que je l'aime see'est un fait, ton égoïsme m'inquiète
Après toutes ces soirées passées seuls en tête à tête
Chaque chose a une fin, et see'est la fin de la fête
Pour toi, car bientôt il n'why aura plus que lui et moi, lui et moi.

To have found this perfect life
And a perfect love so strong
Well there can't be nothing worse
Than a perfect love gone wrong

You said I wasn't just your Christmas toy
I'd always be your boy
I'd be your faithful companion
And I would follow you through every thick and thin
Don't need nobody else
And we don't need him

Once that you've decided on a killing 
First you make a stone of your heart 
And if you find that your hands are still willing 
Then you can turn a murder into art 

There really isn't any need for bloodshed 
You just do it with a little more finesse 
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious 
In history's great dark hall of fame 
All our greatest killers were industrious 
At least the ones that we all know by name 

But you can reach the top of your profession 
If you become the leader of the land 
For murder is the sport of the elected 
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your A, be	, see, D, E

Sting,"In the quiet time of evening
When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
And we wondered just what happened

To the life we knew before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me and you reminded me

That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter

But you stayed in my corner
The only world I knew was upside down
And now the world and me, I know you carry me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost, we could refuse to try

But we made it through in the dark night
Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me

I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different
You showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure

But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game
And you could've made it through
But your funny friend and you.

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet in a bigger guy
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry

Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together ?til the end this time
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together till the day we die

I won't complain or make a fuss

Are those two funny friends, that's us

Angry words that were spoken, when I should have wept
There's a chapter of secrets, and words to confess
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies.

Though the pages are numbered 
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read
In the book of my life

There's a chapter on fathers a chapter on sons
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat,
There's a page where we fail to meet

There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
There's a chapter on god that I don't understand
There's a promise of Heaven and Hell but I'm damned if I see

I can't see where they lead

Walk away in emptiness, walk away in sorrow,
Walk away from yesterday, walk away tomorrow,

If you're walking to escape, to escape from your affliction
You'd be walking in a great circle, a circle of addiction
Did you ever wonder what you'd been carrying since the world was black?
You see yourself in a looking glass with a tombstone on your back

Walk away in emptiness, walk away in sorrow,
Walk away from yesterday, walk away tomorrow,
Walk away in anger, walk away in pain
Walk away from life itself, walk into the rain

All this wandering has led me to this place
Inside the well of my memory, sweet rain of forgiveness
I'm just hanging here in space

Now I'm suspended between my darkest fears and dearest hope
Yes I've been walking, now I'm hanging from a dead man's rope 
With Hell below me, and Heaven in the sky above
I've been walking, I've been walking away from Jesus' love 

Walk away in emptiness, walk away in sorrow,
Walk away from yesterday, walk away tomorrow,
Walk away in anger, walk away in pain
Walk away from life itself, walk into the rain

All this wandering has led me to this place
Inside the well of my memory, sweet rain of forgiveness
I'm just hanging here in space

The shadows fall 
Around my bed
When the hand of an angel,
The hand of an angel is reaching down above my head

All this wandering has led me to this place
Inside the well of my memory, sweet rain of forgiveness
Now I'm walking in his grace
I'm walking in his footsteps
Walking in his footsteps,
Walking in his footsteps

All the days of my life I will walk with you
All the days of my life I will talk with you
All the days of my life I will share with you
All the days of my life I will bear with you

Walk away from yesterday, walk away tomorrow,

Sting,"Inside the doors are sealed to love
Inside my heart is sleeping 
Inside the fingers of my glove
Inside the bones of my right hand
Inside it's colder than the stars
Inside the dogs are weeping
Inside the circus of the wind
Inside the clocks are filled with sand 
Inside she'll never hurt me
Inside the winter's creeping
Inside the compass of the night
Inside the folding of the land

Outside the stars are turning
Outside the world's still burning 

Inside my head's a box of stars I never dared to open
Inside the wounded hide their scars, inside this lonesome sparrow's fall
Inside the songs of our defeat, they sing of treaties broken
Inside this army's in retreat, we hide beneath the thunder's call

Outside the rain keeps falling
Outside the drums are calling
Outside the flood won't wait
Outside they're hammering down the gate

Love is the child of an endless war
Love is an open wound still raw 
Love is a shameless banner unfurled
Love's an explosion, 
Love is the fire of the world
Love is a violent star
A tide of destruction
Love is an angry scar
A violation, a mutilation, capitulation, love is annihilation.

Inside the failures of the light, the night is wrapped around me
Inside my eyes deny their sight, you'd never find me in this place
Inside we're hidden from the moonlight, we shift between the shadows
Inside the compass of the night, inside the memory of your face

Outside the walls are shaking
Inside the dogs are waking
Outside the hurricane won't wait 
Inside they're howling down the gate

Love is the child of an endless war
Love is an open wound still raw 
Love is a shameless banner unfurled
Love's an explosion,
Love is the fire at the end of the world
Love is a violent star
A tide of destruction
Love is an angry scar
The pain of instruction
Love is a violation, a mutilation, capitulation, 
Love is annihilation.

A spiral stair above my bed 
I dream the stairs don't ask me why, 
I throw myself into the sky

Love me like a father, love me like a prodigal son

Sting,"Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken 
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken 
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers

There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer

There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor 
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number

And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say 
And you tell him that you're never coming home

She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's right
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day 
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better

The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella 
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her

Now in her imagination she's a million miles away
When too many of his promises got broken on the way
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say
And she told him she was never coming home
She told him she was never coming home

I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head 
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better

I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late
I'm almost done and then I see the letter

In his imagination she's a universe away
Too many of his promises got broken on the way
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say
And she told him she was never coming home,
She told him she was never coming home,
She told him she was never coming home

And she told him she was never coming home

Just leave your hair in a mess
I've been searching long enough
I begged the moon and the stars above 
For sacred love

I've been up, I've been down
I've been lonesome, in this godless town
You're my religion, you're my church
You're the holy grail at the end of my search 
Have I been down on my knees for long enough?
I've been searching the planet to find 
Sacred love

The spirit moves on the water
She takes the shape of this heavenly daughter
She's rising up like a river in flood 
The word got made into flesh and blood
The sky grew dark, and the earth she shook
Just like a prophecy in the Holy Book
Thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not doubt that this love is real
So I got down on my knees and I prayed to the skies
When I looked up could I trust my eyes?
All the saints and angels and the stars up above
They all bowed down to the flower of creation
Every man every woman
Every race every nation 
It all comes down to this 
Sacred love

Don't need no doctor, don't need no pills
I got a cure for the country's ills
Here she comes like a river in flood 
The word got made into flesh and blood 
Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill
But if you don't love her your best friend will

All the saints up in heaven and the stars up above
It all comes down, it all comes down 
It all comes down to love,

There's a wire in my jacket, this is my trade

I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star

So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights
And we drive into the night

Oh the smell of the leather always excited my imagination
And I picture myself in this different situation
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near

She picks the kids up from some private school
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone

But there's just a flat line on your cardiogram

Yet you always made a profit baby
If it was a famine or a feast

Yes, I'm the soul of indiscretion,
I was cursed with x-ray vision,
I could see right through all the lies you told,
When you smiled for the television

And you may win this war that's coming
But would you tolerate the peace?

And those little cotton flags
Invest in wooden caskets 
In guns and body bags, guns and body bags

And it always made good sense
You know the war can make you rich my friend

Invest in every tyranny

When all the earthly wars are over
You may find yourself just standing there
On the white cliffs of Dover

You may ask, what does it profit a man
To gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? 
Is that your body you see on the rocks below
As the tide begins to roll?

And you invested in this prison
From which you never got released
You may have won this war we're fighting
But would you tolerate the peace?

A war on our dissent
There's a war inside religion

On the birds and the bees

There's a war on education 
A war on information
A war between the sexes

Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way 
I'm calling out your name

Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's gonna change 
Something's gonna change

Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever this world has got me down, whenever I shed a tear

Whenever the TV makes me mad, whenever I'm paralyzed with fear 
Whenever those dark clouds fill the sky, whenever I lose the reason why
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Whenever the sun refuse to shine, whenever the skies are pouring rain

Whatever I lost I thought was mine whenever I close my eyes in pain
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name
Whenever this dark begins to fall

Whenever I'm vulnerable and small
Whenever I feel like I could die
Whenever I'm holding back the tears that I cry 
Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face

I'm already praying
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I'm forced to lie awake and have to weep 

Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever I say your name, 

No matter how long it takes,
One day we'll be together 
Whenever I say your name, 
let there be no mistake
that day will last forever",Whenever I Say Your Name [Radio Version]
Sting,"Sad to say our mighty ruler
Is not really in the pink
Hopes could not be minuscular
That he'll come back from the brink
Not to beat around the bush
He looks like heading for his box
At the risk of seeming pushy
We must plan for future shocks

According to the Hawk God Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid

Build it, build it
Another pyramid
Build it, build it

Though all doctors and physicians
Have been summoned to his bed
It'll soon be top morticians
We'll be calling for instead
With each wheeze the nation's humming
Egypt shakes with every cough
No two ways about what's coming
No discussion, bets are off

Soon our monarch will have filled the tomb
Just like his fathers did
Summon Egypt's greatest builder
Another pyramid

Build it, build it
Another pyramid
Build it, build it

We hate to depress the nation
But our leader has been told
He should scrub his next vacation
Even put tonight on hold
This is where his loyal priesthood
Has the chance to do him proud
Holy leaders at the least should
See him happy to his shroud

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on standby
Build another pyramid

Sting,"

I'd never imagined before

That the world could be turned on it's head

I'd never have thought

To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love

I'd be lost and so easily led

I guess I was caught

By that hint of a smile on her face


I thought I was happy

When my life was as easy as pie

But that was the past

Of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl

But I'm forced to be living a lie

And she'd never love mew&d

If she knew the truth


Is it asking too much

If I pray for a miracle, miracle

That one day she'll love me

One day she'll say I care


Although he's changing day by day

He finds these tender words of love

Impossible to say

He walks in the room

And I'm never quite sure

If he's trying to be somebody else

I'm liking him better that he's

Not his arrogant self

Perhaps I'm expecting too much

Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love mew&d

One day he'll say I love you

And I will love him until I die


Distant Star

Cast your light

On my life


And one by one

I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love

In this way


And day by dayw&d

We've never been closer than this

And I find myself daring to pray


We'll find these tender ways of love

Impossible to disobeyw&d


One day she'll love me


One day he'll say I love you


And I will love her


Until the moment

Our hearts stop beating

And we are light



",One Day She'll Love Me [From the Emperor's New Groove]
Sting,"If I caught the world in a bottle
And everything was still beneath the moon
Without your love would it shine for me?
If I was smart as Aristotle
And understood the rings around the moon
What would it all matter if you loved me?

Here in your arms 
Where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms 
When everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing would I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancings´ end

If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, Until?

One day you'll meet a stranger 
And all the noise is silenced in the room
you'll feel that you´re close to some mystery
In the moonlight when everything shatters
You´ll feel as if you've known her all your life
The world?s oldest lesson in history

Here in your arms 
Where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms 
When everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing do I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancings end

Saddled up the moon and we would ride

How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me
How unnerved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say?
What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say?
What can you say
When a love affair is over?

So now she's gone away
And I'm alone
With a memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All the heartbreak in her last look
How she must have asked,
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to do?
What can one do
When a love affair is over?
",How Insensitive
Sting,"The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall
The fly her spleen, the little spark his heat
And slender hairs cast shadows though but small
And bees have stings although they be not great
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs
And love is love in beggars and in kings
Where waters smoothest run deep are the fords
The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move
The firmest faith is in the fewest words
The turtles cannot sing and yet they love
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak
They hear and see and sigh, and then they break",The Lowest Trees Have Tops

Sting,"As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow,
Surprised I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow 
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,
A pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear 

Who, scorch'd with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed
As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed.
Alas, quoth he, but newly born in fiery heats I fry,
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I!

My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,
Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns 
The fuel justice layeth on, and mercy blows the coals,
The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defil'd souls,

For which, as now on fire I am to work them to their good,
So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.

And the coastguard in his garden, his glass against his eye

As is the rose that bare Jesu,

By that rose we may well see 
That he is God in persons three,

Sting,"Always this winter child, 
December's sun sits low against the sky 
Cold light on frozen fields, 
The cattle in their stable lowing. 

When two walked this winter road, 
Ten thousand miles seemed nothing to us then, 
Now one walks with heavy tread 
The space between their footsteps slowing 

All day the snow did fall, 
What's left of the day is close drawn in, 
I speak your name as if you'd answer me, 
But the silence of the snow is deafening 

How well do I recall our arguments, 
Our logic owed no debts or recompense, 
Philosophy and faith were ghosts 
That we would chase until 
The gates of heaven were broken 

But something makes me turn, I don't know, 
To see another's footsteps there in the snow, 
I smile to myself and then I wonder why it is 
You only cross my mind in winter",You Only Cross My Mind in Winter
Sting,"Sweet dreams, form a shade
O'er my lovely infant's head.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
By happy, silent, moony beams.

Sweet Sleep, with soft down
Weave thy brows an infant crown.
Sweet Sleep, Angel mild,
Hover o'er my happy child.

Sleep, sleep, happy child,
All creation slept and smiled.
Sleep, sleep, happy sleep
While o'er thee thy mother weep.

Sweet babe, in thy face
Holy image I can trace,
Sweet babe once like thee,
Maker lay and wept for me.

Wept for me, for thee, for all,
When He was an infant small.
Thou His image ever see,
Heavenly face that smiles on thee.

Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
Who became an infant small,
Infant smiles are His own smiles;
Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.",Blake's Cradle Song [*]

Sting,"Turned on the weather man just after the news
I needed sweet rain to wash away my blues
He looked at the chart but he look in vain
Heavy cloud but no rain

Back in time with Louis XVI
At the court of the people he was number one
He'd be the bluest blood they'd ever seen
When the king said hi to the guillotine
The royal astrologer was run out of breath
He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death
He look in sky but he look in vain
Heavy cloud but no rain

Well the land was cracking and the river was dry
All the crops were dying when they ought to be high
So to save his farm from the banker's draft
The farmer took out a book on some old witchcraft
He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain
Heavy cloud but no rain

Heavy cloud but no rain
The sun won't shine till the clouds are gone
The clouds won't go till their work is done
And every morning you'll hear me pray
If only it would rain today

She said she'd save her love for a rainy day

Sting,"Deep in the meadow, under the willow.
A bed of grass, a soft green pillow.
Lay down your head, and close your eyes.
And when they open, the sun will rise.

Here it's safe, and here it's warm.
Here the daisies guard you from every harm.
Here your dreams are sweet, and tomorrow brings them true.
Here is the place where I love you.

Deep in the meadow, hidden far away.
A cloak of green, a moon beam ray.
Forget your woes, and let your troubles lay.
And when again it's morning, they'll wash away.

Here it's safe, and here it's warm.
Here the daisies guard you from every harm.

Sting,"This town, this stain on the sunrise
Disguised in the mist, this morning.
It’s 8 AM, a seagull shouts
A sailor’s warning, this sky.

This bend in the river
Slows down and delivers me
The tide rolls back
And all my memories fade to black.

And yet,
And yet…
I’m back

This town has a strange magnetic pull
Like a homing signal in your skull
And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere
Wondering how in the hell did you end up here?

It’s like an underground river or a hidden stream
That flows through your head and haunts your dream
And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack
And there’s nothing round here that the wide world lacks.

And yet,
And yet…
You’re back

Some night I’d lie on the deck and I’d stare
At the turning of the stars
Those constellations hanging up there
From the cables and the rigging

I wonder if she saw the same or managed to recall my name
Why would she ever think of me, some boy she loved who fled to sea?
And why waste time debating
Whether she’d be waiting for the likes of me?

So you drift into port with the scum of the seas
To the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease!
And the ship’s left the dock, but you’re half past caring
And you haven’t got a clue whose bed you’re sharing.

And your head’s like a hammer on a bulkhead door
And it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw
And there’s bloodstains and glass all over the floor
And you swear to god ye’ll drink no more.

And yet,
And yet…
In truth
It’s too late to find her

Too late to remind her at some garden gate
Where a servant tells me I should wait
And perhaps a door’s slammed in my face
My head must be in outer space.

And yet,
And yet
Before the sun has set
Before the sea there may be something else
That’s waiting for the likes of me.",And Yet
Sting,"Ah, ye've gotta be joking, yr tekkin' the piss,
I'd have to be stupid to go on wi' this,

In a biblical flood, I'd be better off drowned,

I had a friend on the ships his name was Joe Dorsey,
He'd get into port he'd be straight to the horsies,
He begged and he pleaded, he was some operator,
600 to one, and he'd pay me back later,
He claimed it was certain that we'd be in clover,
And the next time we sailed past the White Cliffs of Dover,
We'd be sailing a yacht of our own to the Med,
I lent him the money, I was out of me head,
I didn't see hide of him for nine months, maybe ten,
And didn't the bastard just ask me again?
For the loan of a tenner he'd pay me back soon,
All the money he owed me, I answered the loon,

A passionate courtship albeit brief,
But what happened next, it just beggared belief,
If I tell ye, ye'll be sober.
The second night in she claims she's with child,
Afore yesterday night she'd been pure, undefiled,
I must be the father, court papers she'd filed,
So what did I tell her me rovers?

Sting,"Did you ever hear the theory of the universe?
Where every time you make a choice,
A brand new planet gets created?

Did you ever hear that theory?
Does it carry any sense?
That a choice can split the world in two,
Or is it all just too immense for you?

That they all exist in parallel,
Each one separate from the other,
And every subsequent decision,
Makes a new world then another,
And they all stretch out towards infinity,
Getting further and further away.

Now, were a man to reconsider his position,
And try to spin the world back to its original state?

It's not a scientific proposition,
And relatively speaking… you're late.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And these are different stars,
And these are different constellations,
From the ones that you've described.

Different rules of navigation,
Strange coordinates and lines,
A completely different zodiac,
Of unfamiliar signs.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And those planets are misleading,
I wouldn't even try to take a bearing or a reading,
Just accept that things are different,
You've no choice but to comply,
When smarter men have failed to see,
The logic as to why.

Sting,"Ah, me name is Jackie White and I'm foreman of the yard,
And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Now what about those Trojan wars? And the troubles that they caused?
When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?

There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past,
Just like in ""Spartacus"" that film by Stanley Kubrick.
First it's tragedy then farce then they'll kick you in the arse,
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,
But the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

My name is Arthur Cook, I'm the Union superintendent,
Where I represent the interests of ye's all.
And I listen to you men as you talk about the future,
But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

Steel in the stockyard,

And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told,

Each of us well appointed, we've all but been anointed,
Such was our occupation, this means of our salvation,
We'll make a rope out of our dreams and hopes and tribulations.
We'll weave these strands together, we'll splice a rope and tether,
And though we won't know whether, it's fair or stormy weather,
We'll quit this quay,
And we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.

Pick up your tools, we're not fools to be treated lightly,
We'll weld our souls to the bulkheads, secure them tightly,
We'll use the skills and the crafts that our fathers taught us,
We work with pride, not as slaves, no one ever bought us.

We'll weave a net of our dreams and our hopes between us,
We'll be the envy of that sorry bunch who'll wish they'd been us,
We'll form a web of steel, a structure that will not be broken,

No vessel will outlast her, no other ship gets past her,
We'll quit this quay,

Come strike the floor with your feet all you lads and lasses,
And if you're too old to dance, you can raise your glasses,

Sting,"Me first day in the shipyard, the gaffer says to me,
""I want ye to go to the store lad and get a few things, ye see?
Now here's a list, can ye read lad? Can ye read it back to me?
And me and the boys'll listen while were having wah morning tea.""

Now reading was me pride when I left school at fourteen,
There wouldn't be no problem here, I'd show them I was keen,
But when I starts to reading, they just couldn't hold their mirth,
Hugging themselves and spluttering like they was giving birth.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The gaffer pats me on the head and sends me on me way,
He says, ""Don't come back empty handed lad, or I'll have to dock yer pay.""

So I gets to the store all nervous and the quartermaster's there,
I pulls the list out of me pocket and I starts to read all square,
Well I hadn't barely finished when the store-man's face turns red,
He gives me such an evil look I thought I'd soon be dead.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The store-man swipes me on the head and sends me on me way,
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day.

I gets back home that evening and me mother says to me,
""How was it son? How was your day? Sit down and have some tea.""
I told her of the list I'd read and the trouble I was in,
I couldn't go back tomorrow or the gaffer'd have me skinned.

Sting,"It's all there in the gospels, the Magdalene girl
Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl.
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled,
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold.
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight,
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light.
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill,
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still.

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon,
And I have to be there before daybreak.
Oh I canna be missing, the lads'll expect me,

For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail,
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale,
May the angels protect me if all else should fail,

To a solitary life

How bad could it be
To be my wife'

With one roof above our heads
A warm house to return to

You wouldn't have to learn to

Could last forever

A practical arrangement

Sting,"When August winds are turning
The fishing boats set out upon the sea
I watch 'til they sail out of sight
The winter follows soon
I watch them drawn into the night
Beneath the August moon

No one knows I come here
Some things I don't share
I can't explain the reasons why
It moves me close to tears
Or something in the season's change
Will find me wandering here

And in my public moments
I hear the things I say but they're not me
Perhaps I'll know before I die
Admit that there's a reason why
I count the boats returning to the sea
I count the boats returning to the sea

And in my private moments
I drop the mask that I've been forced to wear
But no one knows this secret me
Where albeit unconsciously
I count the boats returning from the sea
I count the boats returning from the sea",August Winds
Sting,"In 18 hundred and 59, the engineer Brunel,
Would build the greatest ship afloat, and rule the ocean's swell.
Nineteen thousand tons of steel they used to shape the mighty keel,
Forged inside the smelter where they made the gates of Hell…
And the name upon the contract, Isambard Brunel.

As day-by-day the monster grew, the engineer Brunel,
Would watch the devil's handiwork, and woe betide a man who shirks,
Or slows the pace to build the keel, nineteen thousand tons of steel,
Anyone with eyes to see is but a bride of Hell,
And the name upon the draftsman's chart, Isambard Brunel.

A riveter was on the hull with his apprentice lad,
He'd served his time with the older man, some say it was his dad.
200 men upon the shift but when the day is done,
The count is hundred 98…before the setting sun,
They searched the yard all through the night until the morning bell,
No more delays are countenanced by Isambard Brunel,
And so they work a double shift, to make the time in full,
No mention of the missing men… they seal the double hull.

The ship was launched upon the tide and all the townsfolk cheered,
A brass band played but not a word of omens they had feared,
But before the afternoon was out, the celebration wrecked,
A dignitary clutched his heart…and collapsed upon the deck.
No doctors could revive him as the telegraphs would tell,
And the name upon the coffin… Isambard Brunel.

And now upon the open sea, the mighty ship did plough,
But many feared the darkness, in the shadow of its prow.
An explosion on the lower deck, would take the souls of five,
With a growing superstition 'mong the sailors still alive.

The captain and his boy are lost while rowing to the shore,
The crew will threaten mutiny and say they'll work no more,
They began to say the ship was cursed, they hadn't even seen the worst,
They'd signed on able-bodied men, but they wouldn't sail to Hell…
When the name upon the manifest is Isambard Brunel.

For 14 years that ship will sail, misfortune taken hard,
The owners barely find a crew to reach the breakers' yard.
And as they take the plates apart, unseal the double hull,
The breakers call the foreman o'er, they'd found a human skull.
And then they find the younger man, perforced to understand,
That in the hour of their torment, he'd reached his father's hand.

In 18 hundred and 59, the engineer Brunel,
Would build the greatest ship afloat, and rule the mighty swell.
The final shift was over, and the breakers' hammers fell,
And the name upon the manifest, the contract signed in Hell,
Was the same as on the draftsman's chart… one Isambard Brunel.",Ballad of the Great Eastern
Sting,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots
Sting,"When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning,
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears,
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?

So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline,
To face up to the truth of his soul,
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge,
Something strange, unexpected, out of control.

There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection,
And face what he sees without fear,
It takes a man to accept his mortality,
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear.

It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement,
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook,
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself,
And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else.

Like a covering of snow on a winter's night,
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight,
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts,
You still love her but she loves someone else.

And where does that leave you?
You self-styled man of vision.
You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?
To destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission?
Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind?
To regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man,
Use the ice around your heart before it melts,
But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself.

Like a covering of snow on a winter's night,
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight,
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts",I Love Her But She Loves Someone Else
Sting,"They say there's an underground river
That none of us can see
And it flows through winding tunnels
On its way to a tide-less sea

And across that sea is an island
A paradise we are told
Where the toils of life are forgotten
And they call it the Island of Souls

For only a soul can go there
A soul that's been set free
From the confines of a working life
To find eternity

Your old man had a cage for his pigeons
But that's really where he kept his soul
And when he watched them fly he would see himself
Least that's how it was told

But his soul was still trapped in the cage son
While the birds they soared to the sky
But he couldn't find his own way out
Least not 'til the day he died

Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
This solitary madness is where he is driven
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage

I know that he loved you, but he hadn't the words
He'd be easier speaking the language of birds
For to speak of emotion, it just wasn't done
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage

The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty

When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light

For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.

But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,

Sting,"In the streets around here there was nobody tougher than me,
I was quick with me fists and fast with me footwork as you can plainly see,
But while fighting was useful for getting your way,
Among the toughs of the town where you could hold sway,
There had to be something that was better than this,
I was fifteen years old and I'd never been kissed.

Well of course she'd ignore me, her friends would all sneer,
At me bloody nose dripping and me cauliflower ear,
For it's hard to convince in a romantic pose,
With a lovely black eye and a broken nose,
Where a girl is attracted to skills more refined,
Than the pugilist's art, and so I inclined,
To take meself serious as a modern romancer,
And I secretly learnt all the moves of a dancer.

Ye swing to the left, ye swing to the right,
Keep your eyes on your partner, more or less like a fight,
Ye just follow the rhythm, and ye keep to the beat,
The important thing's never to look at your feet,
Then a miracle happens, your mind's in a trance,
Though the strategy's subtle, retreat and advance,
It's all about attitude, all in your stance,
Attention to detail, leaving nothing to chance,
Which explains how the pugilist finally learned how to dance.

Well, I'd waltz with a broomstick and if I was caught,
I'd pretend I was sweeping or practicing sport,
But I really had eyes for your mother ye see,
Wanting her to acknowledge this new version of me,
But now everyone's watching, expecting I'll fail,
But there's fire in me belly, there's wind in me sails,
I knew it was risky and I was taking a chance,
I couldn't retreat now, I had to advance.

So I swing to the left, I swing to the right,
Keep me eyes on me partner, like I would in a fight,
I just keep to the rhythm and follow the beat,
The important thing's never to look at yr feet,
But a miracle's happened, and your mind's in a trance,
They're all laughing and cheering and looking askance,
On the night that the pugilist finally learned how to dance.

It's a three-minute round and you're back in yr corner,
You're licking yr wounds just like little Jack Horner,
Don't let your guard down try a jab with your right,
Or you're losing on points by the end of the night,
Then a miracle happens, and everyone's screaming,
You're pinching yourself just in case you're still dreaming,
You've taken the initiative, you've taken your chance,
It's the night when this pugilist finally learned how to dance.

In a bout where the strategist's bridges were burned,
Where it seemed that his fortune had suddenly turned,
'Twas the night that this scrapper was suddenly dapper,
And this poor fellow's heart was still going like the clappers,
The night that the pugilist finally learned how to dance.",The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance

They're seriously saying it's prolonging me life,
If I'll only submit to the surgical knife?
But what are the odds on a month or a week?
When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak.
When you're tied to a pump and a breathing machine,
With their X-rays and probes and their monitor screens,
And they'll wake ye up hungry, saying ""How do ye feel?""
And then you're stuffed full of pills and a barium meal.

Prolonging me life? Now that's some kind of joke!

Now the bets are all off and the prospects look bleak,
When you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab,
And they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab,
And they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health,
With their radium, chemo and God knows what else?

Well ye can't fault the science, though the logic is weak,
Is it really an eternal life we should seek?

That ship has sailed,

Our mission is more than a struggle for breath,
For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death.
When our mission is love, and compassion and grace,
It's not a test of endurance, or a marathon race.
For love is the sabre, and love is the shield,
Love is the only true power we wield,

What would it profit me, what is it worth?

Let's climb aboard the mothership

I'll take you someplace that you've never been before
A place you might have only dreamt about what's more
Like Moses driving to his promised land
Left turn at the burning bush, a stick shift, two stone tablets
God's commandments in my hands

300 horse in my V8
Close to one hundred MPH
And all the meters up in the red

Sting,"Strange, when you leave me, rain comes down, down, down
When you withdraw from me, towers come tumbling down, down, down

Here comes the sound that I've been waiting for
The sound that tells me when you're walking out my door

Rob me blind, defenseless, my heart sinks down, down, down
I can't wave, I'm drowning and sinking fast, down, down, down, down

Here comes the sound I've been expecting all these years
Here comes the sound of everything I've ever feared
Here comes the sound, the floors below me disappear
Here comes the sound, I force my fingers in my ears

I'm drinking from this bitter cup
The only place that's left is up
I could not fall no further than this, down, down, down, down

Here comes the sound of someone crying in the rain
Here comes the sound of someone pouring out their pain

All lines of communication, down, down, down, down
My forces in retreat and running from this battleground

Here comes the sound I've never heard before
The sound that tells me when you're walking out my door
Here comes the sound of someone calling out for aid
Here comes the sound of someone falling",Down Down Down
Sting,"If I should close my eyes, that my soul can see
And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there

It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there

Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home

And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
And somehow I'll be there",The Empty Chair
Sting,"Many have gone before us now
Many have tried and failed somehow
Many soul on the Queen's highway
Where many a tail light glowed
With the promise of a better life
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

Only the dark we left behind
Will chase us as the road unwinds
Out of sight is out of mind
With many a debt still owed
And the promise of a different life
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

And many a dog went wandering
To sup on fortune's dregs
And many a dog came straggling home
His tail between his sorry legs

Many a caged bird spread his wings
Many a vain bird crowed
And many a songbird lost her way
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

Many a band of brothers rode
In many a painted wagon
Many an unsecured load
Whenever a climbing truck was slowed
There was many a traveler's curse bestowed
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

Many a transport greasy spoon
Many a wasted afternoon
Where many a maiden gave her heart
And many a gift bestowed
But a gift is a yoke to a traveling man
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

If we get back home, we'll tell our tales
To all of those who'll listen
The might have beens, the chances lost
The monies that went missing

And all the memories we'll unload
The wild oats that we'll claim we'd sowed
The stages where we proudly strode
As if our cups had over flowed

Time slips through our fingers fast
Your counterfeits deceived me
If you can't love me this way
Then you must leave me

Tell me how it came to this
Just don't think to spare me this
Perhaps the truth can set us free
From the half truths ensnaring you and me
This black hole of intensity
Collapses on its density
And sucks me to a darker place
That hides behind a broken face

Keep up appearances as they say
And all those reasons you might stay
Ring hollow in my mind today

The taste of your skin
All those bitter reminders
Of the failed state I'm in

How do I breathe now, how do I inhale?
I'm a diver on the seabed, my oxygen's failed
How do I wake up, how do I sleep?
How do I laugh now, I can't even weep?
Where do I run to, where do I hide?
An insect preserved in formaldehyde
Yesterday's paper, its pages curled
How can I live in this broken world?

Keep up appearances as they say
But all those reasons you might stay
Ring hollow in my mind today
I've listened ‘til my head would spin
I don't want half of anything

The sand, it falls in the hour glass

Three penguins and a bear got drowned
The ice they lived on disappeared
Seems things are worse than some had feared

Who knows what else we're going to find?
So do you trust your head or heart
When things all seem to fall apart?
I guess we'll wake up smarter

Today it's raining dogs and cats
Rabbits jumping out of hats
And now what's got us all agog
Tomorrow it's a plague of frogs

When snakes can talk and pigs will fly
And we'll all be so much wiser

They meet by the river, to talk of their marriage plans
""I'm confessing,"" he said, ""I've signed for a soldier
I'm leaving tomorrow for some foreign land""

She watches the pretty young soldiers
As they march themselves off to the war
She wonders if she'll ever see him again
Somehow she doubts it, but she has to be sure

So she rode into town on the very next day
And dressed herself up all in man's array
With a sword and a musket she took the King's shilling
And to fight in some foreign war
She said, ""Yes!,"" she'd be willing

All you pretty young soldiers
In those uniforms that you've never worn
The Captain will come to inspect you all now
""Let me down and you'll all wish you'd never been born""

The Captain astride of his horse's grey flanks
Pulls the pretty young soldier from out of the ranks
His gaze it is fixed and she's starting to shake
He said, ""follow me soldier and listen to the offer that I'm willing to make""

""Come you pretty young soldier
Come and be my right hand
You're having this strange effect on my soul
That I don't quite understand""

""Captain, oh Captain, I've a confession to make
I love someone else and my heart it will break""
And as she released her brown hair from a band
It tumbled all down her shoulders and into his hands

""Oh you pretty young soldier
Come and take my right hand
You're having this strange effect on my soul

The lock is latched and I'm the first to have my
Fingers under this one

Too slow to move any pace I try
Could April come any sooner?

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Stockholm Syndrome,"Time was driftin', this rock has got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, I really gotta hold
So I started searching for a better way

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

LA fever, made me feel alright
But I must admit it got the best of me
Gettin' down, so deep I could've drowned
Now I can't get back to where I used to be

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

New York City, took me with the tide
And I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another know it all fatality

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right

Translucent flesh and feeble bones,
The kind of temple where the whores and villains try to tempt the holistic tomes.
Running rampid with free thought to free form, and the free and clear.

Laundry mat to sift and focus on the bigger, better, now.

Virtues for the rending and laws and systems and stems are ripped

And a winter earned.

The day of the week the reeks of rest, but all we do is catch our breath,
So we can wade naked in the bloody pool, and place our hand on the big, black book.
To watch the knives zigzag between our aching fingers.
A vacation is a countdown, T minus your life and
Counting, time to drag your tongue across the sugar cube,
And hope you get a taste.

And punch me into the dead spout again.

I'm ready to die in obscurity
Cause I'm so tired that I got to go.

Where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm gonna see this through?

Tell me I'm a part of history.
Tell me I can have it all.
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go.

Propped up by lies and promises

They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Every altercation I permit is

Every minute counts against my sentence

Every offer of faith I had
To fight and a dream unfolds

Because the sun left early

Every week decays, 
Every month is rotten

I fall, my mind is all I know
I fall, the table turns to dust
I fall, today, I let go of my trust

What a waste of time I am, 
Every ounce of life is
Just dead flesh
I can't forget, 
But then again you can't let me remember
When I try to speak, 
Every word I say comes out so bleak

Stone Sour,"The girls on the streets look all sad 
In this gold encrusted little town
Why is that? Isn't this the town of dreams?
Yeah, but it comes with a price

It's a town that never does anything and takes all the credit
A place that promises so much and never has a thing to say
Or a care in the world
There is no memory here
No dream for itself but the dreams of others

And all over the world you talk 
About a place you've only seen in the re-runs
Immortalized by its vice and deified for its carnage

There's money in the air there
All you have to do is reach up and grab it

In basements, garages, parking lots, 
Empty lots, school yards, town cars,
Back rooms and more
Diamonds are fashioned from expectations 
And fortified on a steady diet,
Of simple lives and red carpets

The ejaculating zeitgeist in night vision
Culture is a punch line in a motionless blood in the water
The sharks here play games you can't fathom
But you flock here anyway

On college money and credit cards 
Spend a week bullshitting yourself that it was all true,

All of it
Just to watch in horror as it all falls 
Into pieces into the gravity of reality
The starry eyes fade as it dawns on you,
Nothing is guaranteed

You are a part of the great divide, the chosen, or the frozen
Now your miles away without an egg, 
Your college money is a collage of debt
And your credit cards are all snapped in fucking half

Time to wander a landscape in berethed of mercy 
This is now the back lot of your failed movie
A waking dream re-written without your permission
The real luster, the soft focus, the soap opera vision
Is just the hindsight of a world who's just been lied to
Of sad surfs, and untouchable lords

You took a chance didn't you?
The chance didn't have a par for you this time around
Maybe next life

And you can't even walk home

The girls on the street all look sad 
In this cardboard cut-out little town
No wonder, that's the only thing here that's real
The gold is for fools and paradise is lost
But the hungry have never bothered with the cost

Day by day they fall away like rose petals
Like ink that won't dry or fade
It just runs wild down cracks and crevices, grooves and folds

It wasn't right, but all I could do
Was be another number that caught in the fuse

Something happened in nineteen-eighty-two

Are you the enemy?
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time

I don't want yours I just want mine

I'm never alone
I'm always in the middle talking to myself
And all I want to know
Am I really on the road, I just can't tell
It isn't right
But all I can do is take it to a level where I can't refuse
Its a lie
I need you to see
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time
I've seen to much to keep me here
I don't want yours I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate

Deep down there's a Devil inside
He can make you give up everything
Settle if you want to die
Or you can live for a world that must be free

Oh, once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time
I've seen too much to keep me here
I don't want yours, I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate

It was no surprise
It was for her

Too Cool Queenie

There was this boy
He played in a rock-n-roll band
And he wasn't half-bad,
At saving the world
She said he could do no right
So he took his life
His story is true

It's OK cause what goes around, comes around
It's all right cause what goes around, comes around

And now this girl,
Yeah she got real famous
And she made lots of money and
Some of his too
But still she thinks she can do no wrong
Just playing those songs
She's all too cool",Too Cool Queenie

I've wrestled with convictions and I've settled with the tide.
It's more or less uncertainty but still you play the game.
A pedicure won't change the score, but all of this will fade.

So low, better get on,
Everything's stopped (down).
So slow, better get on,
Everything's slowed (down)

Down.

And wash away the mud of all the miles you've left behind.

So batten down the credit cards, the devil's in the den.",Transmissions From a Lonely Room

Stonecircle,"The queen of light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The prince of peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone

Oh, dance in the dark of night
The dark lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe

Side by side we wait the night
The darkest of them all
Ah
Oh

I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold
The seas of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget

The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red, ohhhh
Oh, war is the common cry
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know, ohhh
Ohh

Oh, well, the night is long
The beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black

Sing as you raise your bow
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night

The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back
Oh

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes

Oh oh Oh, ah ah ah ah
Bring it back,
Bring it back,
Bring it back,
Bring it back,
Bring it back,
Bring it back,

Because I don't have any plans 
And the time just passes by 
And there's no way I'm gonna change the way that I spend my days 
'Cause I see no reason why I will not devote my life to a lie.

One day you're gonna see 
It's gonna work out really fine for me 
I know you will look up to me 
One day you're gonna find 
I will no longer be the one who's left behind
I don't want to listen to the things you say anyway.

Can't you see that everyday 
Is such an endless drag you cannot seem to comprehend
And you will never understand 
And even though I've tried so hard 
To make a difference to anyone that really cares 
And I'll enjoy my days anywhere.

No one ever told me that I could stay 
And watch the sun go down today 
No one ever told me that I could stay

Stoneface & Terminal,"Ask her why, she tells the story
Of the souls lost to tainted glory
The strong survive, that's what she told me
But in her eyes there's only mourning

People gotta know what she is
Addictive like the drug that she is
And now I got nothing give
Gave it all just to get away

People got to stay far away
Dangerous girl, don't think she could save
Your life, your heart
It's a mistake

She's soulseeker yeah
Can't you see me now? I'm running back
I need her touch again

Stonewall Jackson,"In a little country village not very far away
There lived a rich but aged man whose hair was turning gray
He had three sons three only ones both Jack and Tom were sly
But Ted was honest as could be he would not tell a lie
The brothers tried to ruin Ted before the old man's eyes
At last the plot begin its work till Ted was much despised
The father then said begone you're heartless to the core
Then the black's sheeps words they came just a ringing through the door
Don't be angry with me dad don't drive me from your door
I know that I've been wayward but I won't be anymore
Just give me one more chance and put me to the test
You'll find the black sheep loves his dad for better than the rest
Year by year sped quickly by the father now grown old
He called to them both Jack and Tom and gave them all his gold
I only need a little room a place at your fireside
One night on Jacks' returning home he brought with him a bride
The three began to hate the father more and more each day
At last he heard the three declare why the old fool's in our way
They then agreed to send him to the poorhouse that was near
Then like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ear
A wagon drives up to the door it is the poorhouse band
The brothers pointed to their dad right there is your man
Then a manly form appeared came rushin' through the crowd
Stop this you brutes the lad replied it shall not be allowed
You took the old man's property and all that he could save
You've even sold the little lot containing mother's grave
I am his son but not your kin from now till judgement day
The father clasped the black sheep's hand and they all heard him say
Don't be angry with me son I know I drove you from my door
I know that I've been foolish lad I've repented o'er and o'er
I should have given you my gold for you have stood the test
I found the black sheep loves his dad for better than the rest

Stonewall Jackson,"They say that love's a very old word it dated back to the starting of time
You can read it in the pages of history where for the love of a woman man has cried
They say that Cesar wealth before the batlle
The one he loved had found somebody knew
And I guess that's why these tears of mine keep falling
Well like him I too am losing you

They say that absence make the heart grow fonder
Short partings can bring tears to our eyes
Like the story of Sampson and Delilah for the love of a woman man has cried
That's why I'm not ashamed to admit it ashamed to say I've cried for you at night
For the pages of history repeal it where for the love of a woman man has cried",Man Has Cried

Tryin' to escape from the cold and the drought
He's all alone in the cold grey sky fly little bluebird fly fly fly
North wind a blowing oh so cold poor little bird is so brave and so bold
He just keeps a flying for a southern sky his only hope is to fly fly fly
Well he's not the only one that's on that trail this old boy he just projail
Always a runnin' always afraid the good Lord above knows I've paid paid paid
Train whistle moaning oh so low and I don't even know where to go
I'll just keep a following the rising sun my only hope is to run run run

Well I was like to give up and turn myself in
But they would only bury me under the pen
So I'll keep a running until the day I die
The thought of this it makes me wanna cry cry cry

Anyway they play the tune it comes out loneliness and blue
When the one you love has gone oh the sadness in a song

While a lonesome city sleeps to pass away the time
By myself I walk the streets with a troubled mind
Up ahead the neon sign it says All night Cafe

Pour a cup of coffee I can hear the jukebox play

No matter how they play the tune it comes out loneliness and blue
When the one you love has gone oh the sadness in a song oh the sadness in a song",Sadness in a Song
