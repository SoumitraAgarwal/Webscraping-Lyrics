Foo Fighters,"Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shinning once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

Every time I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black",The Deepest Blues Are Black

Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun
I can be your trouble
Shiver into you
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black

When it comes closing in
Reject
Cause I gotta move
And the simple things get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back

Foo Fighters,"Oh you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waiting and I wait at the longest night
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline

I was down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing last
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, they have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

Finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Heart across a heart that beats it's best

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's
Been mine, all mine

Ain't no way, DOA
Ain't no way, DOA

It's a shame we have to disappear
No ones getting out of here, alive

This time
This time
This time",DOA
Foo Fighters,"Burn all the candles out
Make a wish but not aloud
Relive the here and now
See you now and then
I'm a revolvin' door
I've seen it all before
I will begin again
But I can't start until I've seen you end

I took a look around
I believe that in these eyes
The treasure's all we've found
May be more than needed
Now that we're old and worn
A little ripped and torn
One day we'll be reborn
One day I will meet you up again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling

I'm feelin' out of luck
Maybe I just feel too much
That old familiar touch
Always stained my skin
The good in everyone
The ties we left undone
The heart that meets your blood
All the things bring me 'round again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

With a lock to keep him
In its just a quiet room

With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played

He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says never mind
And no one speaks

He thinks he drinks too much
Cause when he tells his two best friends
I think I drink too much

A place I've never been

Hear me screamin'
Breaking in the muted skies
This thunder heart
Like bombs beating
Echoing a thousand miles

Mine is yours and yours is mine
There is no divide
In your honor
I would die tonight

Mine is yours and yours is mine
I will sacrifice
In your honor
I would die tonight

Can you feel me
Feel me breathing

For receiving
Deliver me into the other side

Begging for sweet relief
A blessing in disguise
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep

We could waste the day
Follow me into the trees

Bring some change up to the bridge
Bring some alcohol
There we'll make a final wish
Just before the fall

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Watch the sunrise all alone
Sitting on the tracks
Hear the train come roaring in
Never coming back

Laying quiet in the grass
Everything is still
River stones and broken bones
Scattered on the hill

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word

Always was a lucky one

Promise I will be forever yours

Here forever deep beneath the dirt

Right where I belong, just hangin' on

Somewhere so unknown, it heals the soul
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in shadows of them all
I'd stand, but they're much to tall
And I fall

Is there somewhere you should be
Was it something that I said the time I held you down

Don't say what I don't mean

Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see
No looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Light began to fade
Into the black

Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly
Feel me anymore

Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything
Was said and done

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive

Still I tried to find my way
Spinning now was end of days
Burning like a flame
Behind my eyes

Drown it out
Drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, slave to the disguise

Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time
To say goodbye

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive
No reason left
Me to survive
You saved me
The day you came alive

Say have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in it's place

A stubborn heart remains unchanged

Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight

No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh God I've sealed my fate

Long road to ruin

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay

Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close,
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope.

Then it comes around and it's taken away,
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most,
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost.

Come down, don't you resist,
You've such a delicate wrist.
And if I give it a twist,
Something to hold when I lose my grip.
Will I find something in the air,
To give me just what I need.
Another reason to bleed.
One by one hidden up my sleeve,
One by one hidden up my sleeve.

Hey, don't let it go to waste,
I love it but I hate the taste.
Weight keeping me down.

Will I find a believer,
Another one who believes,
Another one that deceives,
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer,
And if you open up wide.
If you let me inside,

Fool's Garden,"Who you gonna be?
The owner of the moon
A soon forgotten hero with a never fading bloom
Who you wanna be?
When you realize you're failing all the time
Who you wanna be?

Where do you wanna go?
When you leave your past behind
When you move yourself in circles
When there's nothing left to find
Where do you wanna go?
When you feel there's nothing left for you to do

Who you wanna be?
In a world of sad and loneliness
Who you wanna be?
You're full of all the emptiness
Who you wanna be?
When the moon is on the wane

An ordinary man got a ticket to the life to come
You will attain the land a day
Hey man, what you wanna take along
Don't you know the price you pay

For your greedy thoughts, your pretty Gods
You give yourself away
Who you wanna be?
Where you wanna go?

Mr. Mirror don't tell me what you see
I'm a content man in a modern world
That's all I want to be
So why should I go to a place I never wanted to belong

I don't wanna be in a world of sad and loneliness
I don't wanna be the fool of all the emptiness
I don't wanna be no shadow in the rain
An ordinary man, man, yeah

Who you wanna be?
In a world of sad and loneliness
Who you wanna be?
When you're full of all the emptiness
Who you wanna be?
When the moon is on the wane

She said one day her husband went to get a paper and the motherfucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, but keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked so why you gotta worry me for

Now he left a in hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my bed
Oh now that he's gone well life carries on and I miss him like a hole in the head
Well sometimes you can't change and you can't choose
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose

Now we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives
Where we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry
Where we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives

Let my love look like You and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died

Run wild. To risk everything. To hold nothing back. 
To lay it all on the line: your reputation, your success, your comfort. 
It's that moment when fear is overcome by faith. Live free. 
It's not the liberty to do whatever you want whenever and wherever you want, 
But rather it's living in accordance with the author of humanity 
And finding freedom by connecting with the creator who conceived you. 
Let the light flood into your eyes for the first time. 
Feeling the blood course through your veins, finding the truest version of yourself 
By knowing the one who knows you even better than you know yourself. 
Love strong. Because you were first loved. Because without love we all perish. 
Because the earth and the stars can and will pass away, but love, love will always remain",O God Forgive Us

For My Pain...,"Is this love, hate or pain?
For me it's all the same
These are the last words I say
Because I really don't care

If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines

Oh, would you share this world with me?
Oh, nothing compares to this beautiful dream

Make love with me
On the bed of dead leaves
Through the anguish and filth
Together we wander

In the sea of your tears so come with me
And the torment will be complete
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines",Bed of Dead Leaves
For My Pain...,"Another broken day passed by
Another dead night is waiting to come alive
You are already trying to find 
One more way to hide from the burning light

You don't want to feel
Nothing but your hopeless destiny

You can always cry but never complain
All those bitter tears, will it ease the pain?
(It's) Part of the crying game will it ease the pain?

When everything should be fine
I still found you depressed and crying all the time
It seems to me that you want to feel like you're dying
Kiss the darkness and turn you back to the light

You don't want to see
You don't want to feel
Nothing but your hopeless destiny",Broken Days
For My Pain...,"The only hope in this endless night
Is to follow you through the shadows of the deepest blue, away from the light
I hear your voice is calling me: ""Don't be afraid""
But there's something deep inside of me
Forcing me to turn away

Take my hand, don't turn away, I need you to stay
I know a place where the light and the dark can become as one

This loneliness is killing me 
Is there a place we both can live?

You're the dancer in the dark 
You're the child of the light
 
You're the sinner of all time
You're the saint with wings so white

You're the distant shape in the night
You're all the innocence left alive

You're like tainted sun
You're the star shining bright",Dancer in the Dark
For My Pain...,"You threw your web right down on me
You suck my blood just to live
You're the black princess in the garden of grief
Eating me piece by piece

To be with you is like mouth full of spiders
Like needles under my skin
To sleep with you is like a bed filled by snakes
Something I can't resist

Oh, licking your bloody lips,
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh, lash me with your whip
I'm your slave...My dear carniwhore

You're the cocaine on my filthy mirror
Oh my god how I need you
Living in fear to be left alone
My lips turn to blue

I'm like a sheep among the hungry wolves
This is my sorrow blues
You're the poison in my veins
I'm just a fool in your game

In the prison of my own frontiers
Loneliness is my worst fear

And my soul is the price

Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry

Join this misery

Do they crash down and fall apart?

Let's cut the wings away
And the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames

Even deeper than yours

The flame of you life, so sweet sacrifice

It is you your world, (there's) nothing to believe in

The rapture of lust
The ruins of my trust
I will take your heart because you took mine

Painted in my heart

See the eyes of despise
You raped my dreams so I will take you down",Rapture of Lust
For My Pain...,"Lost in your dark eyes
I have seen your shadow world
Moments of madness
Slowly drowning in your love

I promise you nothing
But this earthly misery
Would you share it with me?

High, much higher than moon
Flies away the angel of love
Deep, much deeper and true

Can turn into nightmare before we know
The secret bound of our blood oath
Keeps us together until the dawn",Sea of Emotions
For My Pain...,"A broken voice from the broken dreams
My heart is drowning in loveblood
I can't forget your leaving shape

Everyday is like a long walk in the cold rain
I'm bleeding and loosing my grip
Tomorrow is a closed gate

I have been dead for so long
And no one's gonna shed a tear
I have been dead for so long
And no one seems to care

Sometimes I really hate people close to me
They want to see my reaction
That I don't want to give

Sometimes I really want to be just dead
Without any kind of
Torturing stress

I wrote it in the dead air, I wrote it in the shape of despair
I see the silence in the stranger's smiles
They don't care

Memories in the screams of the gate, my past slowly fades
Questions are stones on my way
I'm still walking anyway",Tomorrow Is a Closed Gate (Dead for So Long)

And there's so little time to right the wrongs.
This is the life that I was meant to live.

I'm vindicated and I swear I will make this worth my time.

For Today,"Everyone dies, but not everyone truly lives.
Everyone dies, but the faithful will live on to rule the Kingdom.

Destiny comes for the ones unsatisfied with a life lived in the shadows
Generations past that will last in the history of the eternal Kingdom.
You’ll hear their names, and see their faces.
Their story goes on, ’cause death can’t intimidate or restrain the army of the Lord. 

I will live forever, because I stand on the rock of ages.
I will live forever, because the Lord has never faded.
I will live forever, between the end and the beginning.
I will live for the fame of the Holy King, the immortal One.

Each generation has claimed that there is power in His name
To heal the broken, and set the captives free.

As the carriers of light for the everlasting One.

For Today,"Broken men are delivered from their bondage to sin
The hardest hearts break in surrender, and heaven conquers once again

that there was only One who could break the chains that bound me

My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man
My King is alive! My King is alive!
And He is worthy of everything

I know I’m not the only one who felt the hands of death
But I have found the only One who can restore this life
I, I am convinced He can save you, because I was once in need of a savior

If an individual loves God supremely, he will be as conscious that he lives for God 
As that he lives at all

This is the end of a life that's been poured out for all mankind.
In suffering, manifest glory has come at the fullness of time.

Why would He live like a servant?
King of kings, descending lower now.
Why should He die like a slave?

The last will be first do inherit the earth.
I know down is the way up, so master, show me how to serve.
The last will be first do inherit the earth.

It should have been me
With the nails through my hand and feet,
Facing the wrath of God.
It should have been me,
Left to pay for my sin, forsaken.
But in the blood, I stand here.

Born to die,
He bore the fire of God's holy wrath on his shoulders.
Born to die,
I watched him pour out his life as a ransom for all.

And as he carried his cross on his back, beaten and bloody, I saw myself there, too; because I've been broken by a world that hates me.
But I'm not alone anymore.
No one could take his life - he laid it down for me.
That twisted wreath of thorns, he took that crown for me; then after three days, out of the ground for me, he overcame it all!
Now I live to serve him.

With stripes on his back, betrayed by the ones that he'd loved so perfectly, we spit in his face and we crowned him...

And my mouth it fills with blood
I can hear my mother crying
But one voice is not enough

I was facing the full wrath of hell, feeble as it is
I was facing a good death as well (this is glorious)
Face to face with the grave I was waiting for
And now my killers were
Face to face with a faith they can't ignore

Foreign Legion,"Prozac- I think Socrates said it best, when he said, yo what the hell did I just drink

[Prozac]
As you sit there listenin to this foreign legion record your chillin
but somebody somewhere else just blew their brains out on the ceiling
someone else just made their first million dealing cocaine
somebody somewhere else is making love out in the rain
at the same time I spit this rhyme someone is dissin me
someone just got HIV losing their virginity
someone else is giving me props on how I rock mics (meanwhile)
Britain is abusing human rights
someone saw the lighted guide and now they think their saved
someone just sold their only child to be a slave
someone's taking shelter in a cave while others bath
in solid gold bath tubs, someone else is on their nuts
what's strange to me is all this happens simultaneously
somebody wins the lottery
someone lost their fortune
someone's parents died on they're an orphan
someone else is boarding a plain that's gonna crash into the ocean
someone just got caught doing strange things with lotion
someone got adopted
someone else got an abortion
someone's staring down into a coffin at their mother
someone's propositioning a cop who's undercover
someone's with their secret lover putting on a rubber
someone got a job because their color not they skill
someone just got killed over a twenty dollar bill
someone's taking money from their child to buy a rock
someone said they'd keep it real but now they're going pop

Foreign Legion,"One... (no!)... Two... Three  (no!)  One, Two, Three  (ow!)

Prozac - you know I'm not crazy son, take this tip
Hold this cigarette over your mouth 'cause you know they can read your lips
'Cause they need to control your environment
Surveillance - a requirement
That's why they put those I-Spy cameras in fire hydrants
You know they got x-ray satellites to read your mail before it's opened
They got this secret base beneath the ocean
Testing out explosions of nuclear bombs down in the Oakland
That's why all those crackheads are smokin'
It's remote-controlled emotions triggered by cops with laptops
A chip inside your skin implanted with your Tetanus shot
Long before you could walk, they had you locked and barcoded
By race, color and class, your life is downloaded
They send subliminals with minimal efforts so you're unable
To control your thought process ever since they installed your cable
Reason for your behavior - DirecTV is the ringer
Why else would intelligent people tune in to Jerry Springer?
It's all lies, from baseball, to apple pies, to mom
Waco, Texas, Heaven's Gate, the Oklahoma bomb
The Desert Storm Syndrome, experiment that went wrong
Inject our own 'cause they probably won't come home anyway
The Vietnam conflict was a mere experiment
Soldiers came back from the war, couldn't tell you where they want
And commandoes that don't come back could use to their advantage
'Cause they're the guinea pigs to repopulate Atlantis

[Chorus - scratched]
""FBI spying on us through the radio antennas""
""Cause there's nowhere to hide unless you move to outer space""
(x4)

Some say that I hallucinate these men in black suits
But they don't want to know the truth about the Freemasons' pursuits
Illuminati's selling human bodies to the Martians
They faked Bruce Lee's death so he can train alien Spartans
When you drink a 40 ounce brew, all you really do
Is ingest enzymes the government designed to lower your IQ
Pass genetic flaws, although the combination varies
And this is why the cheapest liquor tastes just like fruits and berries
That's 'cause they want to kill all the Blacks, so they invented gangsta rap
Lace tracks with evil thoughts of selling crack for Cadillacs and CREAM
Target the pro-ghetto teen who reads those rap magazines
Keep him broke by advertising hundred-dollar jeans

The grassy knoll - rock, rock on

First they tell you that it's good to put that Vitamin see inside your diet
Shape tablets like cartoons so the kids all want to try it
You wouldn't expect the long-term effects - it comes in stages
It causes [?] Syndrome in the heavy user's babies
They killed Kennedy, Biggie, Tupac and Abe Lincoln
They planned the Titanic's sinkin'
They killed Marvin Gaye for thinkin'
They killed Versace - canceled Joanie Loves Chaci
Killed Princess Di and framed the papparazzi
It's all an evil plan written by the Illuminati
Long before Adolf Hitler ever changed his name to Liberace
The details are spotty about him and John Gotti
They've got a home for clones in the center of the Mojave
How do we cook with radiation? Build space stations?
We got that information from secret alien nations
It's amazing they're so brazen with the equation for restoration
Margaret Thatcher's looked the same since the King assassination
I'm basing information on data that was decoded
From transmitters destroyed when the Hindenberg exploded
They're paying people I know to get close to plant the bugs
Putting drugs in my tap water, thinning my blood
Just 'cause I panic, they'll label me a paranoid schizophrenic
My rhyme's authentic
Just like that giant asteroid that's headed straight for our planet
They call me a manic
Depressed suicidal nutcase to keep it candid
'Cause they know that I know the final hour's near
Any minute now the coming Armageddon's here
Any moment now the coming Armageddon's here
Any second now the coming Armageddon's here

I've wished for you again		
I waited for you beneath the willow tree
Where as a child I used to play
If only I could be as free
If only I could truly say
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
I used to pick you a fist full of flowers
Wilting in my sweaty palm
I used to sit by the river for hours
Listening to her music and I'd sing along
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
Take my resistance take what you will
Take my pride I've had my fill
I'm no longer worried what the future might bring
I think I'll just sit here by the river and sing
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender.",I Surrender
Forest Sun,"Hey, hey midnight
Won't you wake me when you're here?
I don't mind, I don't mind, if I disappear
Wrap myself in twilight
Feel the darkness on my skin
Don't 	forget now midnight
Won't you wake me when you get in
I will wade, wade in your softly scented waters
I will wait for you to come home
Want is a knife that shapes my life
Cuts through the flesh, cuts through the bone.
Hey,  hey midnight
Won't you wake me when you appear
Won't you help me find help me find my tears
There's so much to tell you
I don't know where to begin
Don't forget now midnight
Won't you wake me when you get in
I will walk in your quiet garden
I will dream of people I’ve known

Cuts through the flesh, cuts through the bone

Tell me again tell me again, there's nothing to fear.",Midnight
Forest Sun,"How many times must I fall?
How many times must I call your name?
How many times must I count my wishes?
Count my blessings cause it's all the same to you
Who fill your days
Watching for signs you say
Right time, right people, right place
To leap your walls, let your curtain fall and fly
Go on fly
How many times must you block your self in
With your talk of sin and tired metaphors?
How many times must you pull your self down
Too loaded to walk through the door
To the wide and waiting world?
Go on girl and fly
And when you land you may find
All that's changed is your mind
And that's everything
Open your eyes, you realize
The only difference between fall and flight is you
The only difference between fallen and flight is you
The only difference
The difference is you",Not Afraid

This cosmic blunder that we are
Color blind and tone deaf

Cast me on your shore
I care no more for this world
We have fallen from the time
When love was yours and mine
And grew freely in our hearts and in our minds
Now we must try again
To love once more my friend
There's no telling what we'll find
Cast me on your shore
I will no more look behind
Cast me on your shore
We must be willing to compromise
With what we've always known
Wipe the sleep out from your eyes
Can't you feel it in your bones?
It's time we were gone

Forest Sun,"I met a savior at the bus stop
She said she'd lost her faith in God
A man sitting next to her
Said it really doesn't matter
You still are who you are.
She said she was a poet
But stopped writing
She had nothing more to say.
He said he was a painter
But stopped painting
When all his colors turned to gray.
Come and wake the world from its slumber!
Come and shake us from our beds!
We would follow if someone led
Next to me there sat an actor
Crying to himself, sad and alone.
He said he'd played so many roles
None of which he chose
And now he'd forgotten his own
I said savior have you no wisdom
To offer us before you go?
She just smiled and shook her head
Looked me in the eye and softly said
I don't know, I don't know.
Cause I tried to wake the world from its slumber
I tried to shake us from our beds
I tried to break this spell we're under
But no one followed where I led
So if you see a savior at the bus stop
Don't expect too much
She’s probably got a broken heart
This world can be so hard
Seems even saviors have it rough",Saviour

Pearl from sand
I know you can, I know you can
And just one dance with me
Thus begins the alchemy
Love will lay down like a lion at our feet
Your eyes tell the story
That your words can't hide

Round and round we go
How long it lasts ain't nobody knows

You've built your hopes so high
And me afraid of heights

The less I need to fight
And all the mildew and the dust

Now all my money’s spent
Got no house, Got no rent
Tried so hard didn’t even make a dent
You can’t decide if you’re on the fence
That nightingale must have been heaven sent

So much love with no regrets
So much love we paid off our debts
We dove right in and we got wet in the ocean
In the ocean
Love’s great big ocean
We dove right in
I bought a western shirt you know the kind with snaps
And the trumpet players playing taps
It’s hard to force yourself to relax 
When the future looms with impending doom
And the woman I left back in San Francisco
She’s still crying into her pillow
Four years like a blanket wrapped ‘round her shoulders
She’s still wishing that I’d hold her
And I wouldn’t mind, I wouldn’t mind
Did you ever see your reflection in a tear rolling down a freckled cheek?
Did you ever have weeks feel like days and days feel like weeks?
I drank scotch and played backgammon
Till I couldn’t keep my eyes open
Tried to let her go but I couldn’t help hoping 
For a chance of what we never had
Are we throwing out the good with the bad?
I’m still smiling she’s still sad 
An we’re both just drops in the ocean

Drops in the ocean
That’s all we are
Well the water forms ‘round the porch screen door
I wonder what I’m still sitting here for
Put my feet up the wall lay down on the floor
Maybe play a little piano
But the water won’t stop so I better start swimming
Tears well up I better keep grinning
The crowds shown up guess I better start singing about love’s great big ocean
Well my best friends down in Mexico
I wonder how he’s doing
I wonder if he knows 
That I spent the night in a cheap motel by the side of the road?
Except that cheap motels aren’t cheap anymore
Sixty-five bucks and the toilet didn’t flush 
And the TV didn’t even have a remote
Still it felt just like a boat
Out on the ocean
Floating on the ocean
Sailing on the ocean
Surfing on the ocean in my very own boat
Well I went to bed early got up late
Some folks think it’s great some folks can’t relate
Some folks dance with the devil I’d rather dance with my fate
And take the muses out to dinner
We had gospel brunch down at Maria’s
If you don’t come by later I guess I’ll see you 
Somewhere down the line
Don’t worry about me I’ll be fine
Just tell me a joke
Make me laugh 
I’ll be sleeping on your couch for a week and a half
I need a jump in the springs
A roll in the grass
I wonder how long I can last In this ocean
This great big ocean
Lost in the ocean
Come on in 
The waters fine
And I don’t mind",Drops in the Ocean

We’re walking early in the evening

We’re laughing early in the evening
And when the sun goes down
We’ll drive the truck to town
See who’s playing down at the old saloon

We’re at this bar
And I was complaining how I couldn’t get that far
With this dark haired beauty at the other end
He said don’t worry I’ll take care of this my friend
He stood up and drained his glass
Took out his little bow
Pulled back his last arrow 
And he let it go
And it nearly knocked him over
But cross the crowded bar room it sped
Found my dark haired beauty
And hit her in the head
Love’s last arrow 
Has missed its mark
Hit her head but Not her heart
Cupid’s quiver’s empty
My heart is too
I shouldn’t let him tempt me

Hey cupid!
Aw’ man you missed again
Now you might think love would come round pretty quick
With cupid as my friend 
You’d think I’d have my pick
But every time we go out the girls think he’s so cute
With those little wings
And his birthday suit
An they never notice me 
but you know he’s not to blame
He tries his best to help me
He’s just got shitty aim
Love’s last arrow’s missed its mark
Hit her head but
Not her heart
In the morning when she awakes
Her heart will be fine

Forest Sun,"Railroad tracks and river bends
An unexpected call from a long lost friend
The bittersweet sadness when the story ends
Eighth notes from a saxophone
After a long trip and I’m heading home
The soft morning silence when I wake alone
That kind of blue
I can’t remember
But it makes me swear that I once knew
That kind of blue
That sings so soulful
That old melody that gospel tune
That kind of blue
Chagall windows at the institute
Chicory flowers sticking out of my boots
Playing an old piano on a rainy afternoon
The sound of the breeze as it blows 
The faint hint of sandalwood and rose
I’m laughing and I’m crying because she knows
That kind of blue, I can’t hold on to
But it makes me feel I’m almost there
That kind of blue
Like the darkest midnight
I can’t see a thing but I’m not scared
That kind of blue
That kind of blue
That speaks of freedom
And calls me out from my hiding place
That kind of blue
That asks for nothing
Just lays me down, kisses my face
That kind of blue
These six strings show me
When she’s sleeping softly in the next room
That kind of blue
That lets her hold me
Then let’s me go to watch her bloom
That kind of blue",That Kind of Blue
Forest Sun,"Everybody wants to feel those arms around them
To be rocked like a cradle by their mama, their lover or the Lord
And hearts live on no matter how you try and drown them
So throw that self-righteous self-pity overboard
You greet the dawn with such nonchalance
As if you’ve seen it all
As if such glory only happens once
As if your heart could walk through walls
Autumn chased me to Charlottesville
The first crisp days following me as I head south
Singing low rumbling harmonies
And laughing right out loud
I’ve got a lover in Carolina
She likes to call me baby doll
She’s a waitress at the anywhere diner
She’s got a heart that can walk through walls
Languid summer slowly said goodbye
With tranquil smile and hooded eyes
Still dancing to last nights music
Still waiting for the moon to rise
Dropped my life in a big blue mailbox
In an Alabama grocery store parking lot
Got in my car and just drove in circles
Trying to remember what it is I forgot
All the ghosts down in New Orleans
All the sinners in St. Paul
Do they know how much you adore them?
And that your heart can walk through walls?
Poetry isn’t always dark and romantic
Sometimes it just keeps you company
Or offers to take you out to breakfast
Maybe makes you a cup of tea
Do you ever wonder what it was that woke you?
Do you marvel that someone heard your call?
Did you ever ask her if it broke you?

Forest Sun,"Days are growing shorter and colder now
The old north wind blows the leaves across the ground
I lay down in the middle of the road
Looking for faces in the clouds
Sure is quiet now that you’re not around
Is our love unraveling or is just fallen down?
The moon’s out of tune with my colors
The sky is out of time 
It’s grown thin and pale
Just to imagine you with another
Sets my heart to weep and wail
Weep and wail, weep and wail
Sets my heart to weep and wail 
Salt on my tongue, a reminder
Of the earth that greets my steps
Wind in my ears  sweet whispers
Is this only possible or is set?
Our feet already following the trail?
Our souls bound to weep and wail?

Are souls bound to weep and wail?",Weep and Wail

Sitting on this bed in this hotel room
It don’t matter what come before

I’ve got this Honda to carry me
I’ve got six strings for company
I’ve got your voice to remind me of all I left behind me
I’ve got a storage unit in San Rafael
And a host of well-wishers to wish me well
I’m banging around like a clapper in a bell
Yesterday comes to soon
Yesterday it comes too soon
Try to remember December and it’s already June
Take a note from the birds and try and whistle a tune
Yesterday comes to soon
Everywhere I’ve been people’ve been so kind 
Given me a bed and piece of their mind
With all these pieces how do I find mine?
Yesterday comes too soon
Hell no I ain’t waiting

If life is a train and death is just a station

And many a one has asked me to stay

Before the sun broke through the clouds
Held you close and quickly disappeared
In the face of your solemn vow
Did you swear not to make it known?
Did you still hope to make it home?
Are you waiting till the seeds that you’ve sown,
Are all grown?
Flight from center, left from God
All your worries, treaties and wants
Just a wink, perhaps a nod
In the shelter of your frozen response
How quickly to our minds chase our minds when there is nowhere to go but on
How fine the gossamer web intertwines to find the words, to sing the song

Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

You know that I'd be lying
If I said I wasn't getting quite bored of you yet
And your consistent nagging
And your constant state of panic
Is unnecessary stress for me

You're the tip, tip, tip-top of the charts
You're the best thing I've ever done
And the reality is that I wrote this song for you

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers
When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face round here anymore

A drama provider,
An instant update of the world
Shes a first class liar,
A constant forgetter

To turn around,
Turn around baby,

And here I am,
There you go again. (Again)

I heard that parents
Don't like when band guys
Date their daughters
I heard the world
Is gonna end so we're not
Paying our taxes

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing
America nice to meet you

I can't watch the news today
It feels my head with nightmares
I felt the floor collapse
Beneath my feet it's a slow climb
Back to the top to the times that we felt
We can provide for ourselves and our families

I heard that things will change
I'm just so tired of waiting

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing

Title: Nikki
Lyrics to Nikki :
He was the man of every hour
He was a party all alone
He’d give his jacket to a stranger in the cold
She was the beauty queen from dallas
She could put a lion on a leash
And before he knew himself
She knew the man that he could be

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
If you only live once
Stay in the clouds
Never come down
Trust me
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down.“

She was an Angel craving chaos
He was a demon seeking peace
But they were each other’s
toxic cure called codependency
He tried to dig his way out of a coffin
‘cause she smothered him with care
Before they lived in castles
They were dying on a prayer

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
If you only live once
Stay in the clouds
Never come down
Trust me
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down..Whoa”

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
If you only live once
Stay in the clouds
Never come down
Trust me
Alright Nikki, it’s alright 
Baby tonight you can let your hair down.“",Nikki
Forever the Sickest Kids,"You may call me crazy, but that's alright with me
Everyone I know swears that she's cheating on me
I'm just a sucker that fell in love with a liar
I'm flirting with danger, I'm playing with fire

I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart
Taking shots with every guy at the bar,
Taking photos of herself top down in the back of my car

I can't say that she doesn't get to me
I can't say it doesn't rip right through me
I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

From the first time that I saw her,
I knew that I was in love
Got her name tattooed,
Got the mark of the beast on my arm
Down dirty likes to roll in the mud
Got a thirst for sweat an insatiable hunger for blood

Her curves they speak right to me
Her eyes they see right through me
I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater
Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater

She loves to take advantage of me
I don't, I don't, I don't to know why I love her, but I love her
I'm a sucker for pain, I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm...

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater

Forever the Sickest Kids,"I was born in America but I feel like I was raised on mars
No matter how hard I try, I still feel like I'm an alien cause
I was taught at a private school, my parent were scared of what I'd do
If I were bullied, would I one day snap and bring drugs and guns to school

If I told you once, I told you too many times
I've got a real short temper and I'm out of my mind
Should've been medicated when I was young
But my mom chose to pray instead of whoring me out
I can't shake the feeling that I'm falling apart
And I know I've been told I've got fire in my heart
But the world it brings me down
I'm not sure how much more I can take

I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

I was born in a hospital and I'll die in a hospital bed
Alone and happy, will my kids be there, will they bee too busy

You're as fickle as you've ever been
You'll be gone just as soon as the trend ends
I'll be playing in front of ten drunk fans
God willing

Social media, you know you're breaking my heart
I got a hundred thousand people telling me all their thoughts
It's not that I can't relate,
I can't reply to each and every comment made
We're never good enough, no matter how hard we try
There's always a better band, better song, make up your mind
Do you love us for who we are
Or our skinny jeans and tattooed arms

I see the light at the end of the tunnel

Lit by buzzing filament 
And neon glass

Through far and distant lands.
I'll pump through these twisted blood streams
To every corner of your body.

Despite all maps and borders,
And all the wars and globes,
I've been led to uncharted lands.
Forget your compass and scars,
This world will tear you apart.

I'm a newborn taking my first steps.

Hahaha! 
[Coughing]
Who's there? 
Someone's here!

Welcome to my humble abode,
Please don't mind the mess,
Just nest yourself down comfortable,
Let the doctor do the rest

Dear ghost, you look white as a sheet,
Just have yourself a seat.
Open wide and say 'ah!'
Let the doctor take a peek!

Now I must admit I knew you'd come,
Boy it is love,
Elope to save her from disease,
Wash your hands of her blood!

I don't want to alarm you,
But you certainly are ill!
Stricken with a sickness,
Deadly enough to kill!

Would drop dead where he stands!

It ain't no common cold.
What you need's a bonafied
Doctor's miracle.

Now the thing about miracles
Is that they don't grow on trees,
They don't fall from the sky,
You need a doctor like me!

It just ain't easy

Lucky for you, you found me! So
The rest should be no fuss.
But before we get to savin' lives,
There's a few things to discuss.

Now I'm sure you're wonderin',
""What's in it for me?""
Surely I would not perform
These miracles for free!
I'm not askin' for a lot!
It won't cost you a dime!
I just want the princess here with me,

I can't do this!

But you must, Princess!

Sign my life away?

It's the only way!
Trust me, I know,
How this must go!
Just do what the doctor says

He mixed elixirs and filters,
Pried scrolls and read excerpts.
He spoke in foreign phonetics
And read runes from ancient relics,
Stirred ointments with potions, and
Functions with doses.
He whisked it until smoke rose and
Seeped into her nose!

The illness had relinquished.
The doctor had fixed it,
The cleansing accomplished.
Their love was free to flourish.
But before it could sink in,
The front door was kicked in!
Standing in its place was Pallis!
Driven by malice, he had barged in 
To challenge Adakias!
To prove their love!

Forgive Durden,"I've been tracing your steps
Along with your dainty exquisite guest
Across mountain land and serpentining seas
These two have been on quite an odyssey

But you're a fool to think this princess
Could ever really love a couple of poor boys like us
She requires riches recherc
Riding with rodomontading rou's

Casanovas have charmed with chiffons
So Chichi chased her with their conceited coteries
Maharajahs have magniloquently mouthed
Their love for me through their menageries

She's been propositioned
Propounded by every pompous prince
Given panniers of peerless pears
And plums, polished

I've been seduced with shimmering, sparkling stones
Squired by suitors to sizable chateaus
And oh, I'm the one she chose

I understand how you can love a man of truth
So why don't you just ask him where he spent his youth?
Oh, look at her face, she really doesn't see
That you are from the dark and you've been lying through your teeth

Anhura, please listen, I really can explain
I meant to tell you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
Now you know the truth but that knowledge shouldn't change
The nature of our love, we've broken through the chains

I'm sure that she would care to hear your acumen
As to how your presence is the reason she is sick
But I suppose it's in vain, since her life is ending
When I thrust this blade into her heart-a-thumping

Brother, no

Brother, what have I done?
My blade has pierced your side
This was never my intent
O, God, please stay alive

Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You've tried to protect me
But your dagger's edge finding my flesh
It truly was my destiny

Brother, I was shortsighted
I ignored your cries
You really are the chosen one
The calculated sacrifice

Please listen to my last words
Before I fade away
This is my gift to you
Live for your love every day

Please don't let your tired heart stop beating
You're bleeding, just keep breathing
You will take care of this spinning sphere
I'll disappear and see you in the mirror

Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Before I die, please don't cry

The mountains seceded
The Light and Dark depleted
We lost Adakias but regained our science
Our world was finally reunited
So this is my cue of where to leave you

Now it's your story to retell and pass on
Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon
So remember, never surrender
'Cause the unrelenting constancy of love and hope
Will rescue and restore you from any scope

Forgive Durden,"Look at that which surrounds me
I'm supposed to call this home
The dark has become so overwhelming
So why don't I just go

Why can't you just be more like your brother?
Together you would rule the throne
Evil and darkness would grow
This kingdom needs you

""Why can't you just be more like Pallis?"" they always ask
Could this feeling deep in me be the prophecy?
As a child I heard such wonderful stories
Of lamps, and the oracle, and holy the sea

Silly boy, you can't just leave them
Reaching for some fairy tale ending

What's the point of dreaming
If it can never materialize?

Why can't I live up to my family name?
Well it's not me, but you see it's just my pedigree

You're a reckless and romantic rogue
Your head is in the clouds
You'll be chained here all your life
Shackled to the ground
You're not the chosen one

Don't you ever dream of some place better
Or a life that's greater
Don't you ever feel like you've been destined
For something bigger than your skin?

You are so foolish
The dark has been your home
If you elope, I'll hunt you
Through suffering you'll atone

Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You looked and watched over me
But there's something bigger at stake
My purpose is this journey

Brother, you are shortsighted
Naive and starry-eyed
You are not the chosen one
This will be your demise

Brother, I can't help this feeling
My heart tells me to run
You were meant to rule the dark
I was meant to see the sun

Don't you ever feel like you've been destined

""Adakias, tired of fiction and bound by his ambition
Left his home for the city of light
Disguised as a citizen his identity was hidden
Within in a city that sat glistening
He was eager for his new life
He contemplated and hated
Why had he waited for so long
To flee his home forever shaded, where the jaded are never wrong?
He took a deep breath
He was finally gone
His hope was left strong
That a meaning would be found
That had kept him withdrawn
His stare had caught a light
And he fell for the sight
Her name was Princess Anhura
She suffered from the same strife
And like Adakias, she spent most of her time
Dreaming of a different life.""

O the Scientist was the author and the architect. 
The angels were His ink slingers, His actors and actresses. 
His two purest talents were Ahrima and Nidria, two destined hearts,
Bound by the same idea; the unrelenting constancy of love and hope 
Can rescue and restore you from any scope. 
In her, Ahrima confided his curbing frustration. 
His gifts had been exhausted. 
Oh, how they'd misused them. 
She averted his passion and eased his blood. 
And so he confessed it to her, he had fallen in love.

Forgive Durden,"Please take a seat. 
Let me tell you both a tale of love and hope. 
It's a story that you may have heard before, told as mythical lore. 
But this translation is clear, unlike the embellishments that have reached your ears. 
There was a boy who shared your bones, your eager blood, your affinity for love. 
He had it all in his hands, and he watched it all turn to sand.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
Then I was truly meant to leave the Dark, 
Down this path set out in front of me. 
I will reunite this world's divided halves. 
Fulfill my history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's my destiny.

Digging 'round the deep, only missing out on sleep. 
Chasing 'bout my head like the wolf that found the sheep. 
Don't go digging 'round there, you be slipping bit too much.
Milling muck and mud with the mind that lost its touch. 
I been traveling 'bout in time, never stepping out for much. 
Deepest of the deep with the wolf that lost those sheep. 
Because it's more than a little but less than a bunch, 
Found their way around with the blind that lost its touch.

The choices he made that day to burn down the world he'd helped create. 
Don't be scared, kid. 
You're gifted. 
Follow this stream, and live out that prophecy. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones. 
Beware of the medicine before you lay your head again. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones.

So they arrived at the doctor's camp, his crude shack. 
A shanty with walls of broken glass, 
Light leaking through the shattered cracks. 
And through he was cordial, the young couple was doubtful.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
I was truly meant to leave the dark down this path set out in front of me.

For the longshoremen had warned them to keep a close eye on their adored ones. 
But they had journeyed for a reason, they were here for the medicine. 
To cure the infection. But nothing could prepare him for the events that would ensnare them. 
All he could do is trust what he knew. He would listen to his gut and live for his love.",Holy the Sea

Yet we curb our speech because words are not enough

O, you snuffed the glow. Replaced it with coals. 
Threw away the throne. O, you snuffed the glow. 
Replaced it with coals. Burnt down my home. 
You had a life of privilege, hope and love. 
But now that's all gone. Maybe the design's flawed. 
So that's why I'm here, to preserve the remainder 
Of what chance we have left at an existence. 
O, the desolate dirt. The raw, scorched earth. 
It's a trophy of your worth. O, the desolate dirt. 
The raw, scorched earth. It's a scar of my hurt. 
Your cold, wicked soul boasts a foul scent.

No, a stench

The formidable taste of pure contempt. 
Every dark corner will soon see the light.

O, so bright.

The beaming flood will pour right through the binds. 
My words will tear through the air, 
Pierce through the despair, 
To find your arrogant, throbbing ears. 
If it's too much to bear, or to hear, 
Or take, I'll be frank, 
Let my inflection be crystal clear. 
This mess that you've made, it's a six-foot grave. 
It's a home for your lonesome bones that remain. 
We'll disappear, but you'll stay here to rot 
As The King of The Dark and Forgot.

What have I done? Please make me your son. 
What have I become? Destroyed all I love.

O, what have you done? 
Disobedient son, you've broken the trust of your father's love.

The arid, fallow earth would be Ahrima's new hearth. 
He would remain while he watched his family strain, 
And the girl that he loved, vacate to a new place, 
To state over on fresh terrain. 
And from his desolate throne he watched them compose 
A mountainous wall of stone, to separate themselves from him. 
A massive, jagged barricade to lock themselves in. 
Theirs would be the Light, his would be the Dark. 
For a century these halves would wait. 
One world, set apart.

Place your hand on mine. 
Untie your mind. 
We'll just disengage.

Love makes the streets again. Do you remember when?
You laughed and called me names. Times changed, you're not the same
From inner city hell. Dead walls and smoking smells.
You used to be a child. Waton mad and raving wild

You have a friend in your gun.
You get your way having fun.
You, on the run going wild.
Now it's no fun, you must run you must hide.

Pool halls and stolen cars. Another night behind the bars.
What I want, I will take. Trust me I'll be your snake.
Nothing can hold me back when I start my attack.
Gray walls will be my friend, till I break out again.

Fort Minor,"You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof; I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin' fire and Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Everybody's searching for somethin'
But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
Back home
Ain't nobody hoping and praying
'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
Life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
'Cause ain't a damn thing free
Back home

Back home they holler ""disciple"" and ""blackstone""
Some black they freebase yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it
In many ways this city raised me and gave me
The drama, honor, and bravery
The streets seem hollow when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow
Times hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival gangs rival
Signs painted on the walls like hieroglyphics
I tell 'em that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael tryin' not to stay idle

Back home it's not Compton but close
The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
And folks are so common
It don't really bother us much we just swallow it uh
Crack the bottle and smoke hope tomorrow something
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home we get the good life at glimpse
In the form of a rap start, drug dealers, and pimps
I'm back home

Back home I try my best to keep it together it's cold
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth looking for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source need something to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life
Only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight bringing truth back to the game

Back home we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on something 'cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop bottom line doing what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people calling us hopeless
People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
But focus
Focus is overrated
Cause you see very blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver living right in the litter
Where kids write nigga right inside the L.A River
On the concrete a symbol of out everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay",Back Home

Fort Minor,"Man, I love this rap game mainly cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangster than it really is
You can't appear weak man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff, if it's not ruff
Then I don't really need it, I'm not even ashamed
I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up man

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I wanna feel fucking cool

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio's like Marlboro Light
They're both selling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they're safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true when we lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting we're like idiots, they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rapper's CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
But twisted up's what I want, man, I can't get enough
Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what, we don't give a fuck

Man, listen to my words, listen for while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car, turn up the track man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap, hey
Matter of fact, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car man, turn up the track
And give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I wanna feel fucking cool
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Over and over but between me and you

Fort Minor,"These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they've lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Standing on the bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking, laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme 
And get away from the grey just a bit of the time

Yeah, kinda funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing outta cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pinecone
It's tough when you live fast, just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense
And I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my sight
Push rocks in a pipe
Liftoff, I keep puffin' 'til my lips turn white
And my chest gets tight, but who the fuck really cares
When you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

Pardon me I think I'm next to url
Too many problems going on that's why I left my girl
Packed my bags and I traveled with a pen and my notepad
Pissed that I was broke and all the things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, see I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but I'm awake in the storm
Writing my life in a short film, The Rise and Fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the walls
Pound pavement aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
And put it all behind me 'cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger, I know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they've lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry, trying to get by
And trying not to feel out of control
And if you look hard enough
Sometimes you'll find a place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, you can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone",Feel Like Home
Fort Minor,"""The dude, he said that, like when we were making the first Linkin Park record he was like, ""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know... maybe you should just be a rock band."" You know what I mean, like, trying to change us. Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like, ""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard""...""

Before the first song that you hear me on
There were people already trying to get me gone
Telling me to quit rapping
Just play the keys that
""My band had a singer"", ""They didn't need me""
But my band had my back, so we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first, but then the humor faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were too good to be true
Some were saying ghostwriters were writing all that we do
So we had to disprove it, we spelled it out
To the detail, how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule:
I only do email responses to print interviews
Because there people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something ducking fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at 'infer'?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first-grade vocabulary words?
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what, which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch

""Can you believe that? Like it's crazy, it sounds crazy right, like at this point, at this point you hear it out and you're like ""That guy was out of his mind"". But honestly that's what he wrote. Besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever, he didn't want me to rap. He was like ""Maybe Joe Hahn should, um, wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat"" on... like when we play... I swear to God he was crazy. And later on he claimed he wrote all our songs so that was really bad.""",Get Me Gone

That the record that I'm making is a mistake

Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
And start asking me the names that I'm not saying

Bigger than the petty name calling

Trying to make my friends turn their backs on the team we've built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this

Angry groups complaining about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, same way that I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing
And start asking the names that I'm not saying
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
You like the hype but pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

Is anybody out there listening

Fort Minor,"“My father came from Japan in 1905. He was fifteen when he immigrated from Japan. He worked until he was able to buy – to actually build a store.”

Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means
Close your eyes and just picture the scene / as I paint it for you
It was World War II when this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier / he was just a man with a family
Who owned a store in LA / that day
He crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids / he lived on the
Second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A from Japan
They called him “Immigrant” / in Japanese
He'd say he was called ""iisei"" / that meant
First Generation In The United States
When everyone was afraid of the Germans / afraid of the “Japs”
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black 'cause
Right there / front page news
Three weeks before 1942
""Pearl Harbor's been bombed and “The Japs Are Coming""
Pictures of soldiers dying and running
Ken knew what it would lead to
Just like he guessed / the President said,
The “evil Japanese” in our home country will be locked away
They gave Ken a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags
Couldn't even pack his clothes
Some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags was all they gave them
When the kids asked mom / where are we going
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't want to lie
He said the US is looking for spies
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are
Stop it / don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wondering
If you gonna run or not 'cause if you run then you might get shot
Other than that / try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it being so crowded
'Cause someday we'll get out / someday / someday.

”Yeah, soon as war broke out, the F.B.I came and… they just come to the house and, you have to come. All the Japanese have to go. They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand, why did they have to take him because he's just an innocent laborer…”

So now they're in a town with soldiers surrounding them
Every day every night / looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them at all
They were just doing their job and
He wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden / vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind he wanted his families life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country
What for?
And time passed in the prison town / he wondered
If he'd live it down when they were free
The only way out was joining the army / and supposedly
Some men went out for the army / signed on
And ended up flying to Japan with a bomb
That 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out
Big hopes of a normal life with his kids and his wife / but
When they got back to their home / and
What they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor:
""Japs not welcome anymore""
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside
He looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him wiped the tears away
And said Someday we'll be okay / someday
Now the names have been changed but the story's true
My family was locked up back in '42
My family was there
Where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp

”When we first got back from camp, it was pretty bad”
“I remember my husband said, ‘Oh, we're going to stay ‘till last.' Then my husband died before they closed the camp”",Kenji

Machine Shop...",Petrified
Fort Minor,"I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and his dad broke up it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside all he was trying to do was get away

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade, when you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did, now you wanna
Run away but you can't cause the past comes back again

Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead
What about a rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think the good Lord would come to take him
I'm shaking him
Wake up you son of a bitch

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away
From red to black",Red to Black
Fort Minor,"You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof; I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin' fire and Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will

Fort Minor,"Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in a car is sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant staring through the window at
Someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
But spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired 
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
As somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
And he knows it looks bad but nothing he can do 
I wonder what it's like to be right there in his shoes but...

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world everything can change just like that...

Somebody right now is dropping his vote
Inside a box trying to not get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now somebody's stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war but he's not really sure the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud, salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

Meanwhile, right now someone's 25-to-life-ing
Standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
Scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now I'm staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light 
And walked right around the corner just out of my sight but...

I'm just taking it in
From a second storey hotel window again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that

Yeah, right now somebody's sittin' in the darkness
Tryin' to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see 'em rushing to get to the office
Wife ride by 'em when she up from the market
Right now somebody comin' out the pocket
Tryin' to dump that rock they runnin' round the block with
Same time the cops is raisin' the glock
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody's struggling to stop this man
That's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall a child is takin' its first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder of he understand what it's worth yet
Life, the time spent while we here on the earth yet
The answers to the questions we all seek
Can be found, it depend on how free y'all think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is a next man's treasure
One man's pain is a next man's pleasure
One says infinity the next say forever
Right now everybody got to get it together man

I'm just taking it in
In another strange hotel lobby again
With my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes just like that
Like that

Fort Minor,"You know me
I used to get caught up in everyday life
Trying to make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tried to figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say
Nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it
This is what he said

Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst you'll see nobody cares
Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared

Now, I don't remember where I met him
Or remember his name
But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said seemed so right it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards, hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck

Because I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid
We're just under-appreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm saying, cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said

And I'm no hero
You remember how it was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything was going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles again
This is where you come in
All of this to explain to you why I had to
Separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around I'd just bring you down
And I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
And I know the way I left wasn't fair
I didn't wanna be around just to bring you down
I'm not a hero but don't think I didn't care",Slip Out the Back
Fort Minor,"Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career

Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,
But now, you only stop by every once in a while,
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time,
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way,
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say,
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,

Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless,
It seems one thing has been true all along,
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone,

This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say, that we ought to
Live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure is
Too much to take, too much weight?
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In the dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

Holly / Tak / Mike:
Gonna be sombody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you the time has come)
Gonna be someone

We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in, lemme say it again
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
When I was young they said the
Odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have
Doesn't exist, telling you you're worthless saying you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really they're pissed cause they'll never achieve some
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

Lupe Fiasco:
They're gonna think you're crazy
Mumbling to yourself in the basement all day
Uh-uh-uh-ing and to yourself
My pops didn't dig it with shoveling it to myself
My boys used to get it they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I knew 'em by heart like a brain in my chest
Then I took 'em to school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, ""Mr. Jaco?""
""Yes?""
""With all that knowledge, you ain't trying to college
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence?""

Let me walk you through the world that I currently stay in
You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken
You can meet and talk to everybody that I live with
Maybe you can tell me why everybody's so distant
Is it me? Or maybe when I look around daily
I don't even know the people I can put my trust in lately
People that I used to hang with, now they're acting so different
I'm still the same person, why doesn't anybody listen?
Can somebody please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
Cause right now I don't know why I pushed through the pain that I got through
And I'm losing hope

I'm going at it the hard way
I focus
Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
I'm going at it the hard way

Let me walk you through the world that I currently live in
Not a thing is forgotten, not a thing is forgiven
Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight
But nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes

Inside you think they know the extent of the pain
But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame

Freedom to chose is keeping me away from you
Action to avoid the ones who care
Reaction I can see that you're still there

So I push and I push until there's no one there
But the air is getting kind of thin up hear
Instability is my best friend right now
My cry for help is that you'll bring me down somehow

Separation lost in a world of I don't care 
For anyone or anything you're not allowed in here

Is take these lies and make them true somehow

Is that I don't belong to you

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be

I took the knife as well

Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand

Kissing my sweetheart, as lovers can.

Foster & Allen,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Walking on a wave's chicane

Out for the night

Lost in the lights

But she's wearing a turban

And she's hoping to God
That they're coming tonight

Sipping a drink
He says, ""I seen them all and
Sister you stink""

Try to be nice
But they're loud and they're dumb
And they bicker and fight

And drop me a line

thinking we're sinking in the sea
You're in your glider the tide you're riding inside her
is turnin with the moony like the sky... boy

Okay, you're Mister Illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
'cause you're young today, tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say

No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

I never never glid before

That's another story - now's the time to go and find

(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

[Chorus]

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.

I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.

Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.

Why are we so content to stay the same?

Marching to the same drum
Every single beat's gone
I can hear the dark days coming

Another generation
Fighting for attention
Can't you see I'm tired of running?

There's a girl I remember
Who was everyone's dream
Now her face has become her
It's the saddest thing you'll ever see

Oh, beauty queen
It's only skin deep
It's only thin sheets
There's no audience

Oh, beauty queen
Something's telling me
That you were never meant to be
Trapped in time

There's a house in the forest
Where her days are forgotten
By the lake she dropped her dreams
Now they've sunk to the bottom

Oh, beauty queen
It's only skin deep
It's only thin sheets
There's no audience

Oh, beauty queen
Something's telling me
That you were never meant to be
Trapped in time",Beauty Queen [*]
Foxes,"Hot dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
If I fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'till it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull and I push too deep then I'll fall right back to you

Is it something I'm dreaming of?
If a steady hand, doesn't rule my heart
Will it lead me to somewhere happy enough?

Now my soul is sore in a sinful world

If I meet myself in a halfway home,
And I will remember the things you said

Love isn't always fair
But that's no reason to be so cruel to me
Hold on to what is there
And count the saints

There's a reason why, I keep it all inside
To shun my hopes from the raining sky
Then arrange it all into simple lines
To be part of a world where love can reside

And the hope's are holding my careful heart

Outside of the club talkin to Valet
Mind started to stray, million miles away
Contemplatin goin back to his crib to par-lay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-ta's perkin, You're Makin Me High
Like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to Reality, the Soul II Soul
Breathin heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said

Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take it back, take it back.
If I... Fox boogie, ragtop, six drop,
Get caught, think not, light Brown,
'Cause we're not to be stopped.
If I...

I came up fast in this crap game they call a rap game.
What the damn, she's killin it again from that dame.
Now every snake, fake-faced, o' jig;
I'm like, just don't sell me the bridge, I buy lakes.
Friends even bend rules, chicks I lent jewels,
Says, ""She's actin' funny now, oh, she's got money now.""
Tryin' to do my thing, y'all, need you on my team,
But you ain't gon' stop my dream, or block my cream.
I liked things better when you called me Ings,
A year before Rap City, way before Screen Scene.
'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was
The first to keep it real, wit' all my secrets concealed.
Things got ill the minute I got a deal,
And my time got shorter, and you was havin' a daughter.
Had to stop hopscotch, get off, I ran;
Damn, I wish we were still playin' jump.

[Chorus]
If I could take this back, I would.
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good,
I would take it back to when we said good-bye.
If I...
If I could take this back, I would.
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good,
I would take it back to when we said good-bye.
If I...

My so-called man thinkin' he slick 'cause I stay on tour;
Thought he'd never get caught tryin' to play on whores.
I cried, as my keys was scrapin' the car doors,
From the trunk to the hood, by the wheel and the floor.
Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide,
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied.
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it.
No Diggity, don't stop, get busy.
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes,
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code.
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses,
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin' my toes?  
As I realize you was just misleadin' me,
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me.

[Chorus]

Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead.
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lie instead.
On the one to one combo, told me you'd die for bread;
That's why I spend these nights, cryin' in the bed.
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread.
I tried to intervene, you said it was over my head,
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man.
Right, but I'm tryin' to keep you in my life,
V.I.A. satellite, talkin' them burn outs.
Soon you had me wilin' and you turned me out,
Taught me 'bout how to win, the code of the streets.
Luxuries and wealth untold, it was sweet.
And one night you asleep after work, was chopped up,
Felt somethin' strange in my veins, I popped up.
One foot in the house, shoot flew to the horn,
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone.

From Brook-lyn to Queensbrige, it's pure Havoc, Havoc
We on a job, fuckin wit Mobb
They had the drop on em, the slanted eyes peep the rocks on em
He kinda jig, and he bubblin big
Dig a hole holdin, so's watch his cash start foldin
And bet though, twenty G craps wet though
Nas you shoulda seen the nigga jet though
Had it on blast, shoulda seen me shakin all of my ass
Of course me, I threw the gas, thug nigga turnin real saucy
Firm lay low I'ma play if you say so
So stay close like I'm bout to twist babe bro
I laid it down, went a couple of rounds, and tried to flaunt him
I threw it on him, now he's right where I want him

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Got my mind in crooked ways
Saturated up in Alize, you ain't a threat nigga
So get big nigga baby girl crossin over send your soldiers
Toucha fuck a rusher, this world is colder
Like a, day in December 25th Son I got gift
From monkey, motherfuckers, that want to rip
Get your shit split, pushed back, grill that ass don't look back
Respect this, like a Lexus repo man I took that
Five cats to death dog, like shop I'm gonna set more
Handwritten obituaries vocal through my chords
Lights out... just pull the nines out
Let's find out, pointin shook ones, they pointin dimes out
It ain't hard, straight up and down, you get your deck pulled
My hand is full, of fake niggaz I position
Expensive intuition fuck a rap competition
Gat expo, get a grip and never let go
The tet blows, the rapper Noyd said, ""That ass is wet though""
Triple P, paranoid plus petrol
Scared to death, put the pedal to the metal
Ghetto connections, Audi 4, take your section
You only get once chance, ain't no second guessin
We blessin, peepin your style, them never testin
Lessons of life walk the night witcha weapon


[chorus] reversed, Havoc takes the main and Foxy joins in

Starts with ""Son it's the drama"" instead*
Verse Three: Foxy Brown
Fox Boogs, whattup, they get the jack, what the fuck
Lucked up, the thug nigga took a L nigga bitched up
The snake niggaz slither like Jake, ain't all great
Ain't no threat Dunn, fuckin with them niggaz that's fake
They got though, pushin a 850 auto, they sayin nada
They know The Firm gettin nachoes
Cheddar like whatever, I see money frontin in the Land
I got him, I got me a fuck and his man
Murderous mami, I threw the kiss, he was hist'
Oooh, shoulda seen that ill Roley on his wrist
It seem like he fuckin wit cream somethin mean
You'll be straight with his eight, and dead him on all his heron
Realistically, papi, is history, mami
I got this, chill Pa Pa, let me rock this
I'm fuckin wit fours to cock this, let me plot this
Ice he nuttin nice, if he front, take his life
At the Shark Bar, fuckin wit Duke, him and his mans
Really frontin boo, got him the red velour Filas too
Here come my niggaz now in the black Hummer stuntin
Yeah that's The Firm, jig the fuck up and body sumpin
Whattup now Duke, his eyes cried from the inside
I seen all of his fears cause he about to fry
He looked at me, through his right eye, was like
""Mami why?"" I felt fucked up, I can't lie
He was shook, 'Mega opened his chest, ain't nuttin left
But the sky blue Land, and that niggaz last breath
Last breath...

Holdin' down the fort, even when its steamin' hot
Money's being got, but honey's acting shady
So I hit it with five between the 380's
Can't fox with a three hundred mercedes

Crack the bitch before I blast his bitch

Dime-chicks, iced up, minked out, rolly six, light grey chrome six,
Go to ask, want to fuck?  Then they throw cash right
'Ay, bitch need some dick in they life,

Learnin' how to seduce niggaz takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, and nice braids, flaunt it
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life

While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them

Can y'all feel my pain?
I can't let it slide
How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?

Yo how can we start this
My life is thorough never heartless
I laid it down from the Gate to the St Louis arches
From the windy city to the streets in Cali
To them streets in Houston
My niggas always boostin'
Some bitches always holla
How they don't spend a dolla
But that's because they ain't got it
Now tell me where's the logic
And if I talk it - I've done did it or about to do it
I'm making anthems, got a million niggas bouncin' to it
Bust your guns!
And if that ain't enough then bust again
I've been thuggin' since be	-I-Z made ""Just A Friend""
Matter of fact ever since Flava Flav was rockin' clocks
And even then there was no bitch that could compare to Fox
Let me head knock, Pretty you wit' me right

So much you couldn't fathom
I wish I didn't have them
They say I'm 7-30, pretty but I rap too dirty
The law is criticizing me and probably never heard me
So what I crashed my Range
My last name ain't changed
This time it's different though
I'm not exploiting names
Yeah I write my shit
It's not a fucking game
So what he wrote some songs
I blew him up the same

I would've killed her but it just wouldn't be fair to mommie

Bad little sista; not bad meaning bad but
bad meaning good - DAM I'm so hood
You should see me in them jeans
It's hard to describe and
Being cocky is just a part of the vibe
I might stop and holla and pop my collar
Maybe a little conceited but that's always needed
Love attention when I'm passin by
See I show a little cleavage then I catch his eye
Just the thought of him eatin, I was outside soakin
Duke standin loc'in, mouth wide open
I walked over, lickin my lips
And adjustin my {tits} and switchin my hips
{Shit} he threw his hand on my waist
Looked in my face and said he wanna know how I taste

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

Now just imagine me nude, stretched out
I'll be all over the news if this gets out
So HOT that the press might ban me
Now how bad you wanna know if I'm sweeter then candy?
What would you risk? Would you put up the car?
Taste my na na in the rain on the hood of your car
Or the back of the plane, {nipples} all out
Bent over the sink with my panties in your mouth
When my dark skin complexion steps in
Won't take no questions to get him and the
thought of Fox give him an erection
to get real stiff at the sight of my {tits}
Now we can role play, you be the pilot
I'll be the stewardess boy I ain't knew to this
When I lay on my stomach and throw my legs back

Or maybe topless, homie I'm priceless bwoy

Yeah, you know its been a long time since y'all heard my voice
Maybe what, 2, 3, years or somethin'
Up and down been high and low
Even been at the point of no return, no hope
Just want to let my fans know that I'm still here
Y'all holla back

The sound was broken, too many years being political
Its kinda hard to do when everything your seeing is critical
Is all my fault what they said in the news
But its funny how the public seems to get it confused
They act like they ain't got nothin' better to do
All they want is a statement, the hattin' is blatin'
But we never paid attention to those who hate us
Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers
But still un-phased, I kept my cool
Plottin, carefully, every step I choose
And my, Cool-whit poin, and my write finery
Everybody want to know my side of the story
Well here it is, the whole truth, plain and simple

From Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby

Dear Mommy, I apologize  
I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized (and)
it's cause of me that at times you want to die
But you was always there when your little Na Na cried (and)
When the media said Foxy's ill  
You was there when this fame almost got me killed
When I was in the hospital, could not be still
Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills
And to my friends I love them and I know they care
But, time after time, you was always there
When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch
I was wailin, while you prayed for me hopin I'll stop
Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth
And I'm sorry for the times when I yelled at you
I love you mommy, sorry that's happened
Please pass the letter to Gavin

Gavin, dang, where do I start
You knew it all, you was there from the start
My cold deed the ear to my heart
Just writing this tears me apart (see)
Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal
Brought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel
I wanted you to know that I did it for us
And I wanted you to know I was committed to us
And of course the long way, we had our disputes
You didn't care for some of the things that I would do
But you still watched my back, complete and the same
You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game (see)
Whether I'm here, or dead in a box
Keep my name alive, you know no bitch is better than Fox
I love you, tell ma I'll never forget her

Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe

Lucky I don't fuck around and get you stuck up
Waitin outside your studio, collect your dub bucks
Bitch - fuck around and get that nigga gun buck
Outside and fully loaded with the gun stashed up
In front of cactus, chrome fo'-fifth
And a bag of full clip for niggaz with loose lip - FIYAH

Now I'm the type of bitch that's one of a kind

Like to be on top or, get it from behind
Either way I throw the pussy like the free throw line
Break a nigga spine, tote a calico and dare
any bitch fi come try test mine
Violate, one time, I cock the nine
You, motherfuckin right I bust a bitch over mine
Shit, niggaz can cheat and put tips in bitches waist
But when we slip up, get a gun in our face
Have me missin show dates, heart beatin slow pace
Wonder what he doin, who the fuck he screwin
Bitches ain't shit; know that that's your man
and they still fuck around and try to suck the nigga dick
And I'm a bad bitch, I don't play that bullshit
Bitch'll catch wreck, I ain't got a full deck nigga

Ever since I was a little girl, always wanted to know
How the fuck these niggaz think, why de man a move so
Why would you jeapordize your whole life
Fuckin one bitch for one night; blame it on the liquor
How would you feel if I fucked another nigga
and told you that that motherfucker made me cum quicker?
You'd probably grab the gat and put two in my back
One in my face, nigga but it's one in my waist
Go 'head and slip, watch me shut down this bitch
Cheat on who? Nigga I'll be gone before you
And when you with the one you love, disrespect the game

Kept asking God why, do I deserve this?

We're human, and through it all, I remained a good woman to you
Prayin for strength and losin my faith
How could you lay in our bed and lie in my face?
Jumpin out my sleep
Havin nightmares of me tossin and turnin, my heart still burnin
Watchin me suffer, relivin my fears
Holdin my pillow close while you dryin my tears
Stop your blood claat cryin, need to stop lyin
and look me in my eyes 'fore these plates start flyin
And how the fuck could you disrespect us
Everything we stand for, all our love and our trust
Seems like I said before, you won't appreciate me

Where them fake thugs got they vest-es chewed up at
Brooklyn beef! Who want that?

I grew up in the thoroughest borough - B.K.
Where B.I.G. had everybody rockin' D.K.
Gav was the first dude with the C.L.K.
And bricks was gettin' shipped outta East L.A.
It's Brooklyn, where niggaz lives was tooken 
Rich cats got knocked and they wallets was tooken
Fort Greene and Hemlock, the fifth been cocked
We cried when they killed Lenox and popped them rocks
(Aiyyo, ya ain't hear, what {the fuck} I just said?)

Where niggaz got Will Smith chips, get jiggy all day

I grew up here, sip Mo', threw up here
Yo the feds snatched two up here, in B.K.

From, C.I. to Saint Marks is carryin cons

So women here make a livin' just carryin' bombs
We pop, corks a little bit and we floss a little bit
In the club, buyin' out Cris', pour us a little bit
I told y'all that my borough is thorough
I know niggaz that'll clap you up and bury the metal

Every time papi raise the weight of that weight, motherfucker

By 22 - the rest of these dudes'll be in the Feds

Niggaz is outta jail but they still locked up
The feds takin flicks when we pullin' the drops up

Tre' pound glocked up, wrist be rocked up

Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one

And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all

Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'
Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

If I keep it gangsta, it's gon' make us all rich
And I stay fucking with Fox cause that's that bitch

Old fashion, mob style, flash no loot
And I don't even get dressed for a video shoot
But I be hoppin' out of Benzes with slippers on
Two bitches, gettin' my Jack Tripper on
Yo Jose, gunplay Artie Clay
Capone bought a house like an hour away
A yo I done my shit, I son yo shit
Don't let me pull a gun and just run yo shit

Run yo shit niggas

From the Stuy to the pub in the Bridge
Who the fluck want what?
Put one in their rib
I'm solo, niggas take Fox for joke
Like I won't spaz off and bring it to folks
We want that straight raw, anti up my nigga
Snatch ya yae, steal your base like Derek Jeter

I don't need to rob niggas
I pay niggas that rob niggas to rob niggas
Tell me what y'all need
Sell it back half price, nigga holla at Fox
Young broad go around in them custom drops
And it's nothing to grab the nines and spit at ya
Bare broke, to roll your stones like Mick Jagger
Hot chrome properly to your dome

Tinted Z3's, you either in it for the love
A thug for the cheese

Flyest nigga bitches give it up to the highest bidder
Holdin' brigets, the more ice, the more sex

Nore's hoes they Star Tek
Creep when my squad rest, more or less
I'll have your family dressed
Niggas eulogizing part of your vest

Have 'em in the hood, gun in their stroller

Foxy Brown,"I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back
Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge)

All my love
(Cause all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'cause I'm always thinking of you

(Cause all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

The breakdown, now bounce to this
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right)
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood
It's all good (yeah) yeah
We gon' bounce ta dis
We make moves with this

Now bounce",All My Love
Foxy Brown,"My heart is filled with so much love

Fozzy,"It's snowing outside, the rumbling sound of engines roar in the night
The mission is near the confident men are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around, they seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed, are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

They're closing in, the fortress is near, it's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in, it's real impossible to climb
They make their way, but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns are echoing all around the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape away from the eagles nest
They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare",Where Eagles Dare

You can't see the things
That make me who I am

And I gotta keep moving, you're living off my sweat
Moving, the devil's on my back
And these are the days that I dreamed about
And you're always there to remind me

You're my enemy
All that we had has gone away
There are times that fade away
But you'll still be my enemy

Seen the same places and faces and traces
I never forget, reject, expect
Quenching my thirst
Complacence is curse

I climb from mountain to mountain
Bird on a wing
Like the wind
The song that I sing

Never satisfied to stand in line
Wasting my mind
It's my time to shine

I just can't get away from yesterday
But I keep on living the wanderer's way
And over and over I start anew
But I can't escape the thoughts of you

I tried to play your game a thousand times
And I let it infect and detect and affect
My clarity, my charity, my destiny
Sold out who I was
And what I could be

At the shadows distorting it all
The walking coffins with painted faces
The evolution beginning to stall

Watch as the day turns to twilight turning old
Feel my skin start to shiver I'm so cold

Only when we're open to the truth can we see what is real
That there is so much more than this
The more we look the more we find
And all the past we leave behind

Believe in nothing what they see
Never digging to reveal
What lies beneath the shallow surface
Is reserved for those who kneel

Scared by what's in the mirror save my soul
Dead to the blackness around me take me home

Oh Lord we need this Great Revival
To change the hearts of man to ensure our own survival
So stand up and understand the need
To look inside ourselves to know this Great Revival starts with me

What'cha gonna go when you've hit the bottom
And the good ol' days are long forgotten
What'cha gonna do when it all falls down
Come on and join our Great Revival

What'cha gonna do when you've lost your focus
And found yourself all consumed in darkness
What'cha gonna do when no one seems to care

Fozzy,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Fozzy,"When the lights go out and the mercury rises
Angels fall to the other side
Fear meets lust just us colliding
When the lights go out we own the night

Blood red pumps up against your body
Beating like drums sucked in the fire
Wrong feels right don't try to fight it
'Cause the night dissolves into desire

When the light go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

Now I lay you down but no ones sleeping
Now I lay you down here in the dark

Lights go out to shouts and screaming
No one gets out without a scar

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Pushing buttons when the lights go, lights go

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Self destructing when the lights go, lights go

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go

Was the groundest tall of all
The light across the ocean
Shall brighter than before
Come to take your last look
Across the barren land
Come to pray for miracles
Beneath the western sky

Wind size from the north
Sun deeps down on time of face
Burns in silent ties
It sails its own for rain tonight
'Coz this could be the last
Come to pray the miracles
Beneath the western sky

I cannot find the words I say
I only want to say to you
I only want the best for you

The caring smile across your eyes
Hey, hello assigned your shell
Do you believe in love

Up the hill once more
Wake up and face your life again

Fra Lippo Lippi,"It's always like this, people I know 
Read many books and save every dream, 
With all of their hope buried inside, somewhere 

And somewhere a man cries for his love 
A love that is lost, that withered too soon 
With all of his hope buried inside, somewhere 

Shouldn't have to be like that 

So all you can say is we need more time 
To get through the things that need to be said, 
With all our trust buried inside, somewhere 

And even if it takes a lifetime of trust 
To build something strong, what happens to us 
With all our faith buried inside, somewhere",Shouldn't Have to Be Like That
Fra Lippo Lippi,"So maybe I lose my heart
Is that so much to shout about
I spent the nights counting the stars
This kind of love is not the love
That was given to us
The distance between us is everything now


Every word getting stranger
Now that I see the paint of you 
Every move getting weaker
You're the gesture I feel from you
No more lies could make me believe
I'm helpless inside of it all


Cause in this crazy world
A pleasure those, and I don't want
I need to know where I belong
I only want to see what this has done to you and me
Afraid if I turn on with nothing at all

And vanish without a warning

And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that I could see her one more time
And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that I could see her one more time

She plays a game of longing
Sympathize some big time living

That every time I come back here
And feel the smell of country air
It's heaven, my own heaven

Fra Lippo Lippi,"Over there, just beneath the moon
There's a man with a burden to keep
Now sleep will fall, washout, rags and
Paperbags, homes and lives passing by

Who will see the beauty in your life,
And who will be there to hear you when you call.
Who will see the madness in your life,and who
Will be there to catch you if you fall.

Dreams run wild, as lovers find their way
Through the night. not a care in the world.
And over there, oh the twinkling of the lights
Harbour lights. say goodnight one more time.",Beauty and Madness
Fra Lippo Lippi,"See it in the eagle flying
See it in a snowflake falling
Feel the wind right through your hair
Now take a bow and have your share

See it in the children playing
See it in a steam of laughter
Memories might fade away
Let's celebrate a brand new day
Cause life will call out and sing
Life makes it hard not to believe

And why should everybody need to know
Every single why and how
Got no other, need no other
Means to carry on

See it in the evening colours
See it in the open wheatfield
Swaying softly in the breeze
With all the grace and all the ease

See it in that crazy moment
When all is one and one is all
It's everywhere you'll ever go
It's everything you'll ever know
Cause life will call out and sing
Life makes it hard not to believe

And why should everybody need to know
Every single why and how
Got no other, need no other
Means to carry on",Crazy Wisdom
Fra Lippo Lippi,"Somewhere the horizon draws a line 
Between the sea and the sky
And in that line of land
You'll find a heart no rain can wash away 


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all


This is where we live
This is where we breathe
This is where we sow
This is where we reap
This is where we live


Walk the promised land
And ride the waves upon the floaming sea
Live are but with the hands and not with words 
But words can make you see


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all

Fra Lippo Lippi,"He will paint the light and shade colors and the trees
He will climb the steepest hill believing what he sees
He will lay down on the ground beneath the old oak tree 
He will sleep forever if you try to set him free 
Sail on the wings of a cloud where to well nobody knows
And cry, cry if you want them to see, die every day to be free
Be proud, to wear the colours that you call your own

Be loud, speak out when you want the world to know
Be strong, hold the flame for everyone to see
Be weak, if you want to love

He will reach out for the sun not dreaming what he sees
He will fall down on his knees angel touching ground

When you knew all along
That you had to go

How could you watch me sleep
So close to you

How could you memorize
My name
And forget who I am

How could you think
You're still the same
Believing I can

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset
Later that the rain
Later than never to love you again

How could you ask for more
With an innocent smile
Trusting me to stay

How could you close the door
And leave me here
Supposing I'm okay

How could you breakdown
My disguise
And uncover my fears

How could you look into my eyes
Ignoring
My tears

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset
Later than the rain
Later than never to love you again

It's too late for a new beginning

Later than the rain

But i know it isnt true

Is my fear of losing you

From the heat and the dust and the sorrow and plain
Believe in me now before it's all too late, too late
Power to the wind on the open sea
To fill the sails and to set us free, set us free

Clouds are not what they used to be, around here
And where are you now and what will you do
And where are you now and what will you do
