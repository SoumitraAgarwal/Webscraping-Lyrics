Diana Krall,"When you're awake
The things you think
Come from the dream
You dream
Thought has wings
And lots of things
Are seldom
What they seem

Sometimes you think
You've lived before
All that you
Live to day
Things you do
Come back to you
As though
They knew the way

Oh the tricks
Your mind can play

It seems we stood
And talked
Like this before
We looked
At each other
In the same way
Then but I
Can't remember
Where or when

The clothes
You're wearing
Are the close
You wore
The smile
You are smiling
You were
Smiling then
But I
Can't remember
Where or when

Some things
That happened
For the
First time
Seem to be
Happening again

And so it seems
That we have
Met before
And that we
Laughed before
Also loved before
But who knows
Where or when",Where or When
Diana Krall,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
Cause you're my thrill

Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps mounting higher
When I look at you
I can't keep still

You, my thrill
You know you are my thrill

Nothing seems to matte
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps mounting higher
When I look at you
I can't keep still

You, my thrill
You know you are my thrill",You're My Thrill
Diana Krall,"All dolled up in your glad rags,
But tomorrow may turn to sad rags,
And they call you glad rag doll!

I know that you're admired,
I know that you're desired
But only by the fellows who soon grow tired,
My poor little glad rag doll!

You're just a pretty little toy the boys like to play with,
You're not the kind that they choose to grow old and grey with!

Now don't you make this, this the end dear,
It's never too late to make amends dear,
My poor little glad rag doll!

You're just a pretty little toy the boys like to play with,
You're not the kind
They have on their mind,
You're just a toy for them today,
So listen to the things I say!

Now don't you make this, this the end dear,
It's never too late to make amends dear,
My poor little glad rag doll!",Glad Rag Doll
Diana Krall,"Night winds, cold and melancholy,
Wave a blue finale
For my tragedy.
Life a miserary,
Meant only for me,
While I linger, weary,
'Neath a willow tree.

Right here our romance was started,
Here again we parted
When I set you free.
All my thoughts are jumbled,
Everything is blurred,
All the world has crumbled,
Shattered by word.

My end has come,
My heart is numb,
'Twas like a bolt from the blue above.
I can't believe it but you're gone, darling,
And here lies love.

The sky is dark
And I hear a lark,
He sounds as sad as a mournful dove.
The dew appears like the tears of dawn, darling,
For here lies love.

All my dreams lost beyond recall,
Dreams of Spring blasted in the Fall,
You gave lips, you gave arms,
I gave all!

I ought to cry,
My eyes are dry,
There's only one thing I'm conscious of;
I only know that I can't go on, darling,
Here lies love.

My end has come,
My heart is numb,
'Twas like a bolt from the blue above.
I can't believe it but you're gone, darling,
And here lies love.

I only know that I can't go on, darling,
For here lies love.",Here Lies Love
Diana Krall,"I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!
You know it's all over town
That you turned me down,
But you shouldn't let that kind of story go 'round!

For you had your chance but now it's all over,
I'll get along somehow!
Now there are things that you did
I used to forgive,
I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!
But you'll never change just as long as you live!
I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!",I Used to Love You But It's All Over Now
Diana Krall,"You said you love me never said goodbye
But I know that just was a lie
I'm a little mixed up ,mixed up about you
I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do

Yeah you said you love me gave me stars above
I've had your baby I had all your love
I'm a little mixed up ,mixed up about you
I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do

We used to walk and talk darling each other sing
But I know now you don't mean a thing
I'm a little mixed up ,mixed up about you
I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do

I'm just a mixed up,mixed up,mixed up fool
Mixed up all 'cause of you
I'm a little mixed up ,mixed up about you
I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do

Now you listen here baby what I have to say
If you don't want me I'll be on my way
I'm a little mixed up ,mixed up about you
I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do

And now you listen here baby won't you come on home

I'm just a little mixed up and I don't know what to do",I'm a Little Mixed Up
Diana Krall,"Here I am, lonely,
Tired and lonely,
Crying for home in vain,
Just like a butterfly that's caught in the rain!

Longing for flowers,
Dreaming of hours
Back in the sun-kissed lane,
Just like a butterfly that's caught in the rain!

I know that all of the world is cheery
By that old cottage door,
Why are my wings so weary?
I can't fly any more!

Here I am praying,
Brokenly saying,
""Give me the sun again!"",
Just like a butterfly that's caught in the rain!

When it's raining from the sky,
And I see a butterfly,
I can almost hear him sighing
'Cause he has to stop his flying.
I can easily sympathise
With those helpless butterflies!

Here I am, lonely,
Tired and lonely,
Crying for home in vain,
Just like a butterfly that's caught in the rain!

Longing for flowers,
Dreaming of hours
Back in the sun-kissed lane,
Just like a butterfly that's caught in the rain!

I know that all of the world is cheery
By that old cottage door,
Why are my wings so weary?
I can't fly any more!

Diana Krall,"The angels are crying, they are shedding their tears,
That's why the rain falls from the sky.
The storm will pass away, there'll come a brighter day,
So cheer up now and dry your eyes.

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain.

Let the love in your heart remain.
Though the dark clouds make you blue and we haven't much it's true,
Still I'm lucky to have someone like you.

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain.

But I know we'll be happy again, we shouldn't worry about the weather,
Just so long as we're together.
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain.

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain.
Let the love in your heart remain.
Though the dark clouds make you blue and we haven't much it's true,
Still I'm lucky to have someone like you.

Diana Krall,"Now my room has got two windows but the sunshine never comes thru,
You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with
You!

[Chorus]
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you.
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry,
I could die, I could die, I could die,
Because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.

(Now my) covers they feel like lead and my pillow it feels like
Stone,
Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,
I'm not used to being alone!

[Chorus]

Now I've been so sad and lonesome since you've left this town,
If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway
Bound!

Diana Krall,"Shadows slowly creeping down the prairie trail
Everything is sleeping - ah, but the nightingale

Moon will soon be climbing in the purple sky
Night winds all a-humming this tender lullaby.

Cares of the day have fled
My little sleepyhead
Stars are in the sky
Time that the prayers were said
My little sleepyhead
To a prairie lullaby

Saddle up your pony
The sandman's here
To guide you down the trail of dreams
Tumble in bed my tired
My little sleepyhead,
To a prairie lullaby

Saddle up your pony
The sandman's here
To guide you down the trail of dreams
Tumble in bed my tired
My little sleepyhead
To a prairie lullaby",Prairie Lullaby
Diana Krall,"We thought that love was over,
That we were really through,
I said I didn't love him,
That we'd begin anew
And you can all believe me,
We sure intended to,
But we just couldn't say goodbye.

The chair and then the sofa,
They broke right down and cried,
The curtains started waving
For me to come inside.
I tell you confidentially,
The tears were hard to hide,
And we just couldn't say goodbye.

The clock was striking twelve o'clock
It smiled on us below,
With folded hands it seemed to say,
""We'll miss you if you go.""

So I went back and kissed him,
And when I looked around,
The room was singing love songs,
And dancing up and down.
And now we're both so happy,
Because at last we've found.
That we just couldn't say goodbye.

People in love are funny
They're mighty hard to explain
One minute they quarrel
Then they're back together again
Take my case for instance
We had a little fuss
Now listen, ladies and gentlemen
Here's what happened to us

I said I didn't love him,
That we'd begin anew

But we just couldn't say goodbye.
The chair and then the sofa,
They broke right down and cried,

I tell you confidentially,
The tears were hard to hide,
And we just couldn't say goodbye.

Diana Krall,"Come on bring up the curtain and let the play being 
We are actors and here's our gig
Life's a stage where it takes your best to win
So give it your all folks while you may
Too soon the shadows they call
And someday that curtain will fall

If you are rich , if you are poor
It's all the same I'm sure 
When the curtain comes down

Just go along doing your best
And you'll find peace and rest
When the curtain comes down

What if everything goes wrong
What if sorrow comes along
Hide your feelings from the throne
Life can't always be a song

While you are here if you play fair
You will be welcomed up there
When the curtain comes down

While the heroes are applauded
The villain is hist
The heroin's happy 
She's fond of and pissed
We smile at the ending
We'll laugh at the clown
And when it's all over
The curtain,the curtain comes down",When the Curtain Comes Down
Diana Krall,"There's a sorrow in the wind
Blowing' down the road I've been
I can hear it cry while shadows steal the sun

But I can not look back now
I've come to far to turn around
And there's still a race ahead that I must run

I'm only halfway home I gotta journey on
To where I'll find the things that I have lost
I've come a long long road still I've got miles to go
I've got a wide wide river to cross

I have stumbled I have strayed
You can trace the tracks I made
All across the memories my heart recalls
But I'm just a refugee won't you say a prayer for me
'Cause sometimes even the strongest soldier falls

I'm only halfway home I gotta journey on
To where I'll find the things that I have lost
I've come a long long road still I've got miles to go
I've got a wide wide river to cross",Wide River to Cross
Diana Krall,"Shaking like a leaf on a tree
That's coming loose from the stem
Shaking like a leaf on a tree
Because I'm coming loose from my man

I'm like a weeping willow
Weeping on my pillow
For years & years
There ain't no sweet man
That's worth the salt of my tears

Down & down he dragged me
Like a fiend he nagged me
For years & years
There ain't no sweet man
That's worth the salt of my tears

Although I may be blue
Still I'm through
I must tell him goodbye
Rather than have that man
Gonna lay me down & just die

So, broken hearted sisters
Aggravating misters
Lend me your ears
There ain't no sweet man
That's worth the salt of my tears

Although I may be blue
Still I'm through
I must tell him goodbye
Rather than have that man
Gonna lay me down & just die

So, broken hearted sisters
Aggravating misters
Lend me your ears
There ain't no sweet man",There Ain’t No Sweet Man That's Worth The Salt Of My Tears
Diana Krall,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people are saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

May as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Alone Again (Naturally)
Diana Krall,"All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day

Diana Krall,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late",Désperado
Diana Krall,"There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the t.v. page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

To build a wall between us
You know they won't win",Don't Dream It's Over
Diana Krall,"Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life

If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've been so alone
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks, down a long, dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light

Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way the back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong",Feels Like Home
Diana Krall,"Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark?
Ah
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

When we get crazy,
It just ain't to right, (try to keep you head, little girl)
Boy, I get lonely, too

Just hold on tight (don't get caught in your little world)

And I can hardly wait to be with you again

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
And I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
And I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more",In My Life
Diana Krall,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

Diana Krall,"Every evening, when all my day's work is through
I call my baby, and ask him what shall we do
I mention movies, but he don't seem to dig that
And then he asks me, why don't I come to his flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By playing records besides a groovy hi-fi
I say yeh yeh, and that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

My baby loves me, she gets a feeling so fine
And when she love me, she makes me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh yeh, yeh yeh

Pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
Don't need to ask me if everything is OK
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive

Oh pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own

Diana Pierce,"Just another homeless family
Hoping for a stranger's charity
Just one night in one safe place to stay
Underneath a star so far away

She carried everything they had and more
The little one the world was waiting for
And somewhere in the night her child was born
Into every heart so tired and torn

And the light shining from that star
Will show you who you are
And his life shining with its light
Will lead you through your darkest night

They couldn't find a room for him back then
But he found a place in the hearts of men
The hope that all the world would come to know
Born beneath that star so long ago

Just another homeless family
Hoping for a stranger's charity
Just one night in one safe place to stay
Underneath a star so far away

Diana Reyes,"Desde hoy, le he prohibido a mis ojos
El mirarte de nuevo a la cara
Tienes algo que acaba conmigo
Y a mi mente, de mi alma separa

Tengo que
Renunciar a quererte
Antes que
Ya no tenga remedio

Si mi vida
Dejara tu suerte
Mi camino
Sera un cementerio mas

Y basta ya
De tu inconciencia
De esta forma tan absurda

De ver a diario como echas a la basura
Mi corazon
Lo que te doy, con tanta fe
De ver en ti felicidad

Me llevare
La dignidad de no caer mas en tu juego
Hare de todo mi interior nuevos senderos
Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

Y basta ya, de tu inconciencia
De esta forma tan absurda
De ver a diario como echas a la basura
Mi corazon, lo que te doy, con tanta fe
De ver en ti felicidad

Me llevare
La dignidad de no caer mas en tu juego
Hare de todo mi interior nuevos senderos
Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

Y llorare, hasta lograr
Que algun dia, ya no te pueda recordar

",Basta Ya
Diana Reyes,"En un dia de estos en el que suelo pensar
""Hoy va a ser el di­a menos pensado""
Nos hemos cruzado has decidido mirar
A los ojitos azules que ahora van a tu lado

Desde el momento en el que te conoci
Resumiendo con prisas tiempo de silencio
Te juro que a nadie le he vuelto a decir
Que tenemos el record del mundo en querernos

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto soy asi

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde
Como siempre la esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si­""

Escapando una noche de un bostezo de sol
Me pediste que te diera un beso.
Con lo barato que sale mi amor
Que te cuesta callarme con uno de esos

Pasaron seis meses y me dijiste adios
Fue un placer coincidir en esta vida
Ahi me quede en una mano el corazon
Y en la otra excusas que ni tu entendi­as.

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi­
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto soy asi.

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
La esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si­""

Y es que empiezo a pensar
Que el amor verdadero es tan solo el primero
Y es que empiezo a sospechar
Que los demas son solo para olvidar

Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
Que llegaras con rosas con mil rosas para mi
Porque ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
Que no importa si es muy tonto, soy asi

Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
Imaginando que vuelves a pasarte por aqui
Donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
La esperanza dice, ""Quieta, hoy quiza si""

Que ya no hago más
Que bailar al compas
Cuando tú me das cuerda

Dicen que como caí
De semejante manera
Dando mi vida por ti
Un cualquiera

Dicen que soy tu muñeca
La esclava de honor
Que te sirve el amor
Cuando tú lo deseas

Y que me llevas a ti
Dando me vueltas y vueltas
Solo para presumir
Y que vean

Tu muñeca eso es
La que tienes
Arrastrándose a tus pies

Tu muñeca, si señor
Tu juguete
Cuando juegas al amor

Tu muñeca, nada más
La que usas
Y que tiras, si ya esta

Dicen que soy tu muñeca
Que no cambiaras
Y espero algo más
Si es que sueño despierta

Dicen que nunca podre
Arrepentirme bastante
De cometer el error
De amarte

Dicen que soy tu muñeca
Que me exprimirás
Que un día dirás
Ay tienes la puerta

Dicen que yo durare
Hasta que tú te diviertas

Que jugaba con el viento

Se apodera de mi mente y eres tu

Y el mar te está mirando desde el sur
Te miro y de repente el horizonte
Es tan distante como tú te miro y de repente
El horizonte es tan distante como tu

Corazón que le has hecho a mi corazón
Corazón luna llena canción de amor
La vida siempre ha sido así tu por tu lado
Y yo por mi corazón mágico

Corazón que le has hecho a mi corazón
Corazón luna llena canción de amor
La vida siempre ha sido así
Tu por tu lado y yo por mi corazón mágico

Corazón que le has hecho a mi corazón
Corazón luna llena canción de amor

Diana Reyes,"Ya no responde ni al teléfono
Pende de un hilo la esperanza mía
Yo no creí jamás poder perder así la cabeza
Por el

Porque de pronto ya no me quería
Porque mi vida se quedo vacía
Nadie contesta mis preguntas, porque
Nada me queda, sin el

Se fue
Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos
Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio
Se fue, su sonrisa de fábula
Se fue, la dulce miel que probé en sus labios

Se fue, me quedo solo su veneno
Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue
Se fue, y desde entonces ya solo tengo lagrimas

Encadenada a noches de locura
Hasta a la cárcel yo iría con el
Toda una vida no basta, sin el

En mi verano ya no sale el sol
Con su tormenta, todo destruyo
Rompiendo en mil pedazos esos sueños que construimos, ayer

Se fue
Se fue, me quedo solo su recuerdo
Se fue, y su amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue
Se fue, y la razón no la se

Se dice dios que a de acordarse de mi
Aunque se, que entre el y yo
El cielo solo tiene nubes negras
Le rogare, le buscare, lo juro, le encontrare
Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas

En esta vida oscura, absurda sin el
Siento que
Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo

Si tiene limite, el amor, lo pasaría por el
Y en el vacío inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento
¡le amare¡

Como le pude amar la vez primera
Que un beso suyo era una vida entera
Sintiendo como me pierdo
Por el

Se fue
Se fue, me quedo solo su recuerdo
Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo
Se fue, y la vida con el se me fue
Se fue, y la razón no la se

Se fue

Tarde de verano
Tu recuerdo es una foto gris
Que las horas

Van difuminando
Que difícil dibujar tus rasgos
Medio día después de partir

Aire si tus ojos
Eran higos negros
Si los dientes
Viejos de limón

No recuerdo
El largo de tus cejas
Ni siquiera puedo hablar
Apenas de otra cosa
Que no sea tu olor

La mente cuando baja la marea
Por puro instinto de
Conservación intento

Cauterizar cada
Huella que deja atrás
El paso del amor

La mente cuando baja la marea
Buscando la escultura
Del dolor activo

Un mecanismo
De defensa para
Que no se ahogue el corazón

Bello, con tu perfecto
Perfil tan libreo
Desalineado lleno
De proyectos hombros
Cargados y zapatos viejos

La mente cuando baja
La marea por puro instinto
De conservación intento
Cauterizar cada huello

Que deja atrás el paso del amor
La mente cuando baja
La marea buscando la escultura

Del dolor activo
Un mecanismo de defensa
Para que no se ahogue el corazón

Tan solo unos segundos
Para desaparecer
Pero sigo tan visible como ayer

Daría lo que fuera por saber
Que el suelo sigue
Aquí bajo mis pies
Pero no, sigo siendo
Tan volátil como ayer

Y daría, tantas cosas daría
Sólo porque este mundo
No girara tan de prisa
Tantas cosas daría

Por no ver tus manías
Por quedarme colgada
Una vez más de tu sonrisa

Daría lo que fuera por saber
Que piensas cuando
Dices que todo va bien
Tal vez, tendría
Una razón para correr

Y daría, tantas cosas daría
Solo porque este mundo
No girara tan de prisa
Tantas cosas daría
Por no ver tus manías

Por quedarme colgada
Una vez más de tu sonrisa
Y ya ves, no me quedan
Tantas cosas por perder

Y daría tantas cosas daría
Solo porque este mundo
No girara tan de prisa
Tantas cosas daría

Y daría

Diana Reyes,"No sé si aun me recuerdas
Nos conocimos
Un tiempo tú el mar y el cielo
Quien me trajo a ti

Abrazaste mis
Abrazos vigilando
Aquel momento
Que fuera el primero
Y lo guardará para mí

Si pudiera volver a nacer
Te vería cada día amanecer
Sonriendo como cada
Vez como aquella vez

Te voy a escribir la canción
Más bonita del mundo
Voy a capturar nuestra
Historia en tan solo

Un segundo, y un día verás que
Este loco de poco se olvida
Por mucho que
Pasen los años de largo en su vida

El día de la despedida
De esta playa de mi vida
Te hice una promesa
Volverte a ver así
Más de cincuenta

Veranos hace
Hoy que no nos vemos
Ni tú ni el mar ni el cielo
Ni quien me trajo a ti

Si pudiera volver a nacer
Te vería cada día amanecer
Sonriendo como cada
Vez como aquella vez

Diana Reyes,"¡La verdad!
Quería que me miraras
Y que a través del rio de gente
Adivinarás que, era para ti

Y que a través
De todo me reconocieras
La verdad quería
Que detuvieras todo lo demás

Por algo que viste igual que yo
Al verte supe que algo en tu mirada
Me estaba llamando

Ven te voy a mostrar
Porque la vida nos puso
En el mismo camino

Ven te voy a mostrar
Porque estoy convencida
De que eres mío

Ven te voy a mostrar
Porque la vida nos puso

Ven te voy a mostrar

De que eres mío

Convencida de
Que soy la mujer para ti
No me dejes ir

Yo no buscaba nada
Pero te encontré

Creí haber visto todo
Pero juro que al verte supe
Que algo en mí siempre
Te estuvo esperando

Ven te voy a mostrar

En el mismo camino

Ven te voy a mostrar
Porque estoy convencida

No se por que dices que haz visto en mis ojos 
Que estaba llorando de celos por ti
Por mas que me veas aveces llorosa 
No creas que siento el amor que perdí

La prueba bien clara esta tarde haz tenido 
Pasaste con otra pa´ verme sufrir 
Y en ves de enojarme como tu haz creído 
Di vuelta a la cara y me puse a reír

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías 
Antes si lloraba 
Pero ya no lloro por tu corazón
Pero si me acuerdo de aquellos momentos en los que me decías 
Que me amabas mucho con todo el cariño de tu corazón 
Pero no lo creas 
No he sido tan tonta que haz vencido mi alma 
Nunca te he querido para que negarlo
No quiero tu amor 

Hay la primera vez llore
La segunda ya no me dolió 
Y la tercera ya ni me acuerdo

No quiero negarlo que estuve celosa 
Al ver que con otra te burlas de mi 
Después de que fue mio el calor de tu boca 
Y yo que en los labios mil besos te di

Nunca había pensado llorar un cariño
Nunca había sabido lo que erea sufrir 
Pero te haz marchado sin darme ni un beso
Que pena dios mio me siento morir

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías 
Antes si lloraba 
Pero ya no lloro por tu corazón
Pero si me acuerdo de aquellos momentos en los que me decías 
Que me amabas mucho con todo el cariño de tu corazón

Y yo esperando a que pidas perdon

Don't know where you've been, my baby 
Heaven must have sent you, honey Into my arms 
Now in the mornin' when I awake 
There's a smile on my face 
You've touched my heart with gladness 
Wiped away all my sadness 
So long I've needed love right near me 
A soft voice to cheer me 
Heaven must have sent you, baby Into my life

It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
Wanna thank you for the joy you brought me 
Thank you for the things you taught me 
Thank you for holding me close when I needed you the most

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

Diana Ross,"Ooowee baby
Honey baby, talk is cheap
So if you want my love to keep
Come and show me that you really care
Ooowee baby

Baby, come and kiss me quick
Come and smear all my lipstick
If you really want my love to share
Ooowee baby

Just one kiss from you is worth
All the talk there in on Earth
A million words don't equal just one touch
Ooowee baby

If your love is really real
Don't just tell me how you feel
If you really love me oh so much
Ooowee baby

You need more than words
In this situation
A kiss can do as much
To make communication

Cuddle me closer
And be real good conversation
So hold me tight, tonight's the night
Fill my heart with pure delight

Ooowee baby
Ooowee baby
Ooowee baby

The words ""I love you"" just don't do
As much for me as just a few
Hugs and kisses every now and then
Ooowee baby

Now that I am in your reach
You don't have to make a speech
Just open up your arms and close me in

Penny pincher but they tease him
Penny pincher 'cause he doesn't spend his money

A penny pincher that's what they say
So from him, other girls shy away
But I love him for what he is
All his love, he truly gives

He may not drive a car
But I love those walks through the park

A penny pincher, he may be
But oh, he means
He means the world to me

I don't care if he won't spend a dime
Just as long as I know he's mine

Let them tease him, call him cheap
But in my book he can't be beat
I love him for what is within

Reminded me you'd never be true
So send me no flowers

Says without me
He can get along
But I know that's just a man's way
Of saying he's strong

But I wouldn't change him, no
Oh, I wouldn't change his funny ways
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days
And though sometimes he brings me little tears
Still love the man he is

If I do something to please him
He never gives me credit
If I think he'll bring me candy and roses
Huh, I might as well forget it

He's the kind of a man
Who likes his privacy
And when a mood hits him
I know when to let him be

But I wouldn't change him, no
I wouldn't change his funny, funny ways
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days
And though sometimes he brings me little tears
Still love the man he is

Sometimes when he hurts me so bad
I think I've got migraine in the head
All he has to do is touch me
Tears disappear
I'll forgive him in a minute

I have to pretend
There ain't much I know
He's the kind of a man
Who likes to run the show

But I wouldn't change him, no
I wouldn't change his funny ways
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days
Though sometimes he brings me little tears

Still love the man he is
Oh, I love that man
I wouldn't change his funny ways
And I wouldn't change the man he is",I Wouldn't Change the Man He Is
Diana Ross,"Keep an eye.
Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend

Keep an eye
Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend

'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose
And then turn around and step in your shoes
I say they'll turn around
And step in your shoes

I stood there, numb
Watchin' my friend walk away
With my love on her arm

Oh, what she said was
""Sorry for what I had to do
But you see I love him just as much as you.""

Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend

Keep an eye
Keep an eye
You better watch out
For your close friend

The devil's workshop is a busy place
On top of evil there's an innocent face
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face
She was just like a spider
Only twice as smart

Kindness was a thread
She used to weave my world apart
There were three of us seen all over town
Now there's only two
Someone's missing 
Guess who?

Now I see how she schemed 
And worked her way in between
Planted seeds of mistrust
To make us fight unaware
Her comforting ways when I would cry
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye
Just like a snake on the limb tree
A friend is an enemy you can see

'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose
And then turn around and step in your shoes
I said they'll turn around
And step in your shoes

So you better keep an eye on your close friend
You better watch out for your close friend
Don't trust nobody
Don't trust nobody
Keep an eye on your close friend
Keep an eye
Don't trust nobody
Keep an eye on your close friend
You better watch out for your close friend

Many ways you'll never know
Many ways I've tried

Promising to be better
Getting into my head

Explaining my reasons for leaving
Hoping it would tear you apart
And leave you grieving

I bet you didn't even read it

You just glanced up at the clock
Cause you knew the exact time I'd knock

Without pride
Here I stand
Waiting for your forgiveness
This is where I belong
Come what may
This time I'll stay

Did you see the front headline
Did you read the morning paper

He's got rhythm, when he stomps his feet
He moves me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and your guns
We're gonna be arrested when the wagon comes

Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me 'cause I don't care

I want a pigfoot and a bottle of gin
Send me daddy, move right in
Feel just like I wanna shop
Give the piano player a drink
Because he's knocking me out

He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet

Diana Ross,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Diana Ross,"Play our love's theme tonight;
My love's here, it's no dream tonight.
It's been so long
Since we've danced to our love song.
I know the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me:
Love's theme.

Play our love's theme once more;
Make him feel, like he felt before.
While the lights are low,
Please, let the music flow.
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me:
Love's theme.

Come and play our love's theme again.
Touch his heart, touch his soul and then,
Once we sip the wine,
His lips will come to mine.

Will be the melody that keeps him close to me:

Diana Ross,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong

I'll do my best to make him stay

I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure he'll come one day
Maybe Tuesday will be

I gave him money
I know I invested well

I've waited long enough

He would return right on that bus

Was a Honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy
She had a sweetheart, mean Little Melvin
And hell would fly between them every Saturday night

Why? Because Little Melvin, he got wild on bathtub gin
Well, it made him feel like he was almost twice his size
So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes

Ya see, Big Mable Murphy, she loved her Little Melvin
But he never did learn to do just what she said
'Cause poor Little Melvin, woke up early every morning
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Late one rainy night, Scarface, muscle and all might
He came in and started shoving everybody around
Well, Big Mable Murphy, she was way back in the kitchen
So just for fun, ol' Scarface shot Little Melvin down

Early next morning, down by the river
They say, old Scarface was found real short of breath
They say, he died, uhh, oh, the man died from a good ol' whipping
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

She gave him two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Girls run around in your head

'Til you wish you had boys instead
Girls, they are such fragile stuff
That you just can't get enough

Oh girls, girls
They are impossible
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

Do I have girls?
Let me tell you about some girls
I have three girls
Rhonda, Tracee and Chudney

I have girls in my bathroom
Girls in my closet
Girls wearing my shoes

My lipstick, my perfume
Sleeping with my husband
What was that?

They say your life changes
When you have kids
Bring it way down, Gill
You know your life doesn't change, it ends

Before the day is done
The sweetness and the sorrow
It's as if I always knew
And I won't forget what I did for love
What I did for love

I do what I had to do
Can't forget, don't regret

Won't you try? Won't you try?

You've been pushing and pulling and shoving
Since the day you were born so let's try

So my heart can take a holiday
From breakin' over him

Summertime when will you come
I wanna put my light things on
I wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day

And I want to drive forever
Wanna roll the windows down
Get the breeze back on my body
Get my feet back on the ground

I want the sand out there to lie on
And the sea out there to swim
So my heart can take a holiday
From breakin' over him

Moving on down the line

Not realizing all the value you had

The day I walked away and left you alone
With hardly an explanation
You stood on your own
And handled the situation
And showed to me
How understanding you could be

Now I'm alone
Looking back at all the years that we shared
Thinking of the pain you should have been spared
Afraid to ask forgiveness
But where can I go
There's no one else to turn to
I still have my pride
But now its time to learn to cast it aside
And come to you with honesty

Give me just one more chance
Such a simple thing I'm asking for
Just one more chance
It would be a shame to close the door to
One more chance
Isn't that what we pray each night for?
One more chance
Isn't that what we're fighting for?
Why throw away a love that needs one more chance

Now I'm afraid that after all I've said
You'll still turn me down and you'll smile
And say I'll see you around
But remember that you still have a choice
And I hope and pray you'll make it
You'll think of my heart
And you won't want to break it
And I'll prove to you the kind of lady I can be

Diana Ross,"Being hurt by the one you love
It's a feeling that's hard to hide
But you don't seem to understand why
When I'm alone I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who's often left alone
All by herself
Neglectfully pushed aside
Set aside like a doll on a shelf
Just ask any girl
Ooh, and you'll understand why
I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who knows the fear of losing
Someone dear
And she'll say the same thing
It hurts you deep
Makes it hard to sleep
Don't take my word
Ask any girl
Then you'll understand why
I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who receives no loving affection
And she'll feel as I feel
It's heartaches by the number
Many nights without slumber
Ask any girl
Ooh, and then you'll know why
I sit and cry
I sit and cry",Ask Any Girl

And wake me when its over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear
Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when
They say ""She don't love him, she don't love him""
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me
For the love of a stranger

What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me I'm dreaming now

Love lies, it makes you feel so clever
You give and it just takes
And leaves your heart to ache, love lies

Whenever I kiss you, you never want to lose control, so cold
It's taken so long to find out
But now I see that we can't even talk now
How your love always turned me on

Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, so sure
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss

I?d defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul

I could tempt, touch, delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, I was so, so sure
But love taught me
Taught me who was, who was, the boss

Chasing the fantasies and feeling all nice
You knew how I loved you, but my-spirit was free
Laughing at the questions
That you once asked of me

Now looking back at all we've had
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long, before we see?

Then whisper sweet little things in my ears

Hugging and kissing
Ooh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

Diana Ross,"My love was in a storm
The bitter wind was blowin' around me
I'd sit and cry but
By and by it just faded away

Rainbow, painted skies,
Brought a smile into my eyes
The scent of flowers filled the air
I turned around and you were there

Hey, you made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

Ooh ooh, since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

One kiss is worth a thousand sighing words
When you're lonely
I saw you smile
It was warm
Now I see beyond the storm

Clouds are fading fast
There goes the sad and bitter past
You touched my life
When no one cared
You did the things that no one dared
You've opened doors

You've made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' givin' again

Since you came

Diana Ross,"My Mistake (Was To Love You)
Diana Ross
(P. Sawyer/G. Jones)

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put om ny face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world",My Mistake
Diana Ross,"This is my place
And I want to share it with you

I got myself a place to dream
I touch the wind
Caress the sea
And I want you there
To hold me
To love me there is to know me

Where the silver bird of tomorrow
Will fly away with the sorrow
And time won't pass for you and I
We'll be standing still
As the world goes by

This is my place
And I want to share it with you

I've got the sky to shelter me
And like the tide I'm moving free
I've waited here for you only
We will walk along
Never lonely

This is my retreat, we're together
And my place is now even better
My life's reflected on the sand
And it shows my love
When I touch your hand

This is my place
And I want to share it with you
I want to share, I want to share it with you

No one, no one
No one gets the prize

We were best of friends
It all began
He came in to town and changed the plan
I knew she felt, the same as me
Which one of us would it be

Just in fun, fight begun
Before long a web of hate was spun
She pretended same as me
Oh, but friends again we'd never be

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies, and I told him lies
No one, no one gets the prize

She schemed and dreamed and told him dirt
That I was wrong for him
I told him all the boys she'd hurt and I would number them
He was the ray of light that made our hearts live
But either one of us knew really how to give
So we scandalized and criticized
And then we learned how to despise

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies and I lied, I lied yeah
No one, no one gets the prize
No, no, no

Yeah, yeah
Back off
Tried to steal him, tried to steal him
Tried to steal him
Runnin' behind my back
Tried to steal him
Tried to show him where it was at

Watch it now
No, no I won't take second place
No, no tell him to his face

Messed around, now he's gone gone gone gone

No, no

I remember hearing your name, sir
If my conversation lacks discretion
It's the same old foolish game

Did I ever give you my key
Did you ever walk through my door, sir

But I need you more and more

I finally acquired what other people live on
I always took what I could find
But on that lucky night
I found me loving you
And the best thing you can do
is to fall in love with

I can feel the glow when we kiss
I don't have the strength to resist you
You must have lit a fire in my heart
'Cause I need you more and more

I'm resting in your arms
And dancing in the moonlight
My emotions are on display
And if I don't see your face
Or feel you in my fingers
I would have to try
To get by with someone like

You relax while I make you warm

Did I leave you without a lover
But I'll never let you out of sight

You're gonna be mine

We keep the system but the rules may change
My lips are wetter, I do it better

I'd like to spend my life wand'ring through

I live on a battlefield
Surrounding by the ruins of a love we built
And them destroyed between us
The smoke has cleared
As I stumble through the rubble
I'm dazed, seeing double
And I'm truly mystified

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield
Though one where not one
Single drop of blood has spilled
Is no less horryfying
Sweet memories
Of a bygone situation
Lie shattered, torn and battered
And scattered all around

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

Everything that can, has gone wrong
It's gonna take spine to carry on
Like a drownin' woman coming up for air
I'm looking for another survivor
I can't see one anywhere

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield, hey
I live on a battlefield, hey
Can't go on, baby
Tears and muddy water
Scattered all around me, babe

Diana Ross,"Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems, dear,
Love has gone away.
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it.
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But I'll blame it on the sun;
The sun that didn't shine.
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.
I'll blame it on the time,
That never was enough.
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,
But my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you what I am feeling,
But words won't come for me to speak.

Oh, I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky.
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.
I'll blame it on the day
That ended much too soon.
I'll blame it on the nights
That could not be,
But my heart blames it on me.",Blame It on the Sun
Diana Ross,"You're trying to tell me something
Every time I come near
I got a feeling the message
Is the one I don't want to hear
You can deny all you want to
But I know you enough to know
Why not come right out and say it
You've been trying to let me down slow
So let's talk before the tears drop

You've had a change of heart
Well I guess that's up to you
I couldn't change my heart
Even if I wanted to
You've had a change of heart

Your kiss sends a message
And I detect the signs
I got enough understanding
Of a lover to realize
That you can't make him love you
Though I give you my best
You're keeping your heart at a distance
And it breaks me up to confess

Or is this change gonna last?

I know you'd try anything
To keep me from that door

How can I walk away
If you're still holding on now?

I've finally found the strength
Look at me, I can finally say
It's over, it's over

As near as the sky,
As near as the tears I don't cry.

Hung up to dry in the teeth of the wind.

That's all there is until the end.

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,

two-forty as his speed

And crack! you'll take the lead.

Diana Ross,"You took a mystery and made me want it 
You got a pedestal and put me on it 
You made me love you out of feeling nothing 
Something that you do 
And I was there and not dancing with anyone 
You took a little, then you took me over 
You set your mark on stealing my heart away 
Crying, trying, anything for you 

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction 
You give me all the after midnight action 
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me 
I'm on a journey for the inspiration 
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation 
I need you to get me nearer to you 
So you can set me free 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower 
You taste a little then you swallow slower 
Nature has a way of yielding treasure 
Pleasure made for you, oh 
You gotta plan, your future is on the run 
Shine a light for the whole world over 
You never find your love if you hide away 
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is 

Get in the middle of a chain reaction 
You get a medal when you're lost in action 
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation 
Instant radiation 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
We get a picture of our love in motion 
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you 
With no more left to say 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
My arms will cover you 

All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction 
You get a medal when you're lost in action 
Don't pass me by 
I want to get your love all ready for the chain reaction",Chain Reaction

Diana Ross,"There you were
Standing there
As your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love I never knew
I found in you

My life was then forfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laying a plan
For everlasting love

Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly

Ooh, my darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has let me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our hapiness

Diana Ross,"Hey!  Life, look at me, I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of

The happening
One day you're up, when you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you

I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened
Suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams torn apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you

The happening
Now I see life for what it is
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened

Is it real?  Is it fake?
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain
Suddenly it starts hurtin'
I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah!  It came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, so sure
I felt secure until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of

Diana Ross,"When I think of home
I think of a place where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing

Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world has changed it's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing

If you're list'ning God
Please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe in the things that we see
Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real to me

And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find a world full of love
Like yours
Like me

Like home...",Home
Diana Ross,"Roll down the gangway
So they'll see that it's me
I know they'll wonder about my recovery

What my heart wouldn't accept

But I rise, yes, it can be done
They keep a holding me down
But I rise, they can't make me run

A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms

A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Whenever you are near I hear a symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby

Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes
I care not for myself but for those
Who've never felt the joy we've felt

I hear a symphony each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now

Diana Ross,"Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Momma, I miss you
Won't you forgive me Momma

I know you have done your very best you could

That certain kind of love that moves all doubts

Keep falling in and out of love
Still searching for that special one
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly

Just when I feel sure love's here to stay
It seems to suddenly just fade away
Can't seem to find that everlasting love
That this heart of mine needs so much of
Keep falling in and out of love
Can't seem to find the lasting kind
It seems I can't find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me

Keep falling in and out of love
Keep falling in and out of love
I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness
Well I'm looking for a love that lingers on
Long after that first kiss is gone
That kind of love that keeps burning bright
Long after we've said goodnight

We're only just beginning
I'm still your lover and your friend
And it's never too late to dream again

You say we've seen the best of all our memories
But if your heart and soul are in it
We'll make a new one every minute

Diana Ross,"You think that I don't feel love
What I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born  in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, by society
Love child, always second best
Love child, diff'rent from the rest
Hold on, whoa

I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me
Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'

Love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood
But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
You, you, you
I'll always love you",Love Child
Diana Ross,"Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone",Love Is Here and Now You're Gone
Diana Ross,"The love bug done bit me
Didn't mean for him to get me
Woo, get up in the morning
And I'm filled with desire
No, no, I can't stop the fire
Love is real live wire
Oh, it's a burning sensation
Far beyond imagination

Love is like an itching in my heart, tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And, baby, I can't scratch it

Keeps me sighing, oh
Keeps me yearning
No mama can't help me
No daddy can't help me
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out of this situation
Now, when you're ill you take a pill
When you're thirsty, drink your fill
What you gonna do, oh yeah
When love gets a hold, a hold on you
Love is like an itching in my heart
And, baby, I can't scratch it

Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection
And I don't know the correction
Got me rocking and a-reeling
And I can't shake the feeling

Love is like an itching in my heart, tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
Baby, I can't scratch it

Keeps me sighing, oo
Keeps me yearning
Keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing
Keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out of this situation
Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
I've been bitten by the love bug",Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart

I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through?

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

As i look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Sometimes i've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And i tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in

But now you've gone away boy
I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me!
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy
Here today!

There was so much you gave me
To my heart
To my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day

Love you, girl

In the palm of my hand

Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl

My mistake, baby was to give you all

You were sweeter
Then my very own kin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends

It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all

Many a smile
You put on my face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

Made you cold, not sweet

You only call her weak

My world is empty without you, babe

But from this loneliness there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

I need your love more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

Without you babe, without you babe

Since love between us no more exist
And each time that darkness falls
If finds me alone with these four walls

Oo, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss, 'cause his kiss I surely miss
All my life I needed someone to need me, so I do my very best to please him
But the more and more I care, the more of him other girls share
When I need a hand to hold, that's the time he leaves me all alone

Just keeps me, keeps me cryin' myself to sleep

I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss, 'cause his kiss I'll surely miss

To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too?
But the more my love has grown, the less love he has shown
He makes promises he doesn't keep
Sometimes I don't see him all week

Just keeps me, keeps me cryin' myself to sleep
Nothing but heartaches oo, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away, oh, no, keep a loving him more each day
Oo, I can't break away from his arms

Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong?
How could life give us love then take it away?

Alone again today
Remembering when we were a brand new morning
We weren't afraid to feel
All that we asked was somewhere to hide

We were like happy children
Reaching out to touch everything that's real
We believed in love
'Cause our lives were touching inside

And baby, remember the things we needed
The summers and the winters and springs we needed
The feeling we would fly
And on wings we needed to share

Remember the people, how few we needed
We always had the me and the you we needed
If every little thing that we knew
We needed to care was there

Then where did we go wrong?
And isn't time supposed to heal me?
Where did we go wrong?
And can a part of you still feel me?

As much as yesterday a touch a world away
We were the time of crystal
Shining for love to see
Both of us gave the things we receive

We were like hungry people
As I gave to you so you gave to me
Believing in our love
'Cause we love the things we believe

Baby, remember the dreams we needed
The nights we couldn't sleep
And these dreams we needed so we could find the time
For what it seems we needed to say

Remember the touches
To show we needed to keep our love
And keep our love the glow we needed
And being here without you
I know we needed to stay that way

But where did we go wrong?
I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong?
How could life give us love then take it away?

Where did we go wrong?
I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong? Where did we go wrong?

Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of the day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know, I'm a fool you see
For that fool is me

Tell me why
Tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of the day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?

Skip a crazy beat?
For I know
It will reach defeat

I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said you can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You gotta trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait how much more can I take
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own

Diana Ross,"Deep in the night
When you think the world is fast asleep
You come to me, take me where I want to go
Making promises I know you'll keep
You're the first love in my life
And the moment we touch
I can tell you how weak I've grown

You make me feel like I never loved a man before
Never held him in my arms, never told him I loved him
I remember all the lovers coming through my door
But you make me feel like I never loved a man before

It's hard to say it
Words don't come so easily to me
But it';s here in my heart
And it's making me lose control
What else can I tell you
Who'd refuse a night that takes you away
And touches your very soul

You make me feel like I never loved a man before
Never held him in my arms, never told him I loved him
I remember all the lovers coming through my door
But you make me feel like I never loved a man before

I went along looking at love differently
Oh but now it's so strong
Look what you've done to me

Diana Ross,"Last night while we were talking, the way that old friends do
I suddenly got lost in my yesterdays with you
I told you that in my heart, you would always be the one
That I'd lie waking in the dark, pray that you will come

But I didn't mean to say that
Somehow it just slipped out
I swear that I would take it back
If I could right now
All I ask is you believe
I'd forgotten where I was
With you there so close to me
I thought that we were still in love

Oh I knew just what I'd done when you stood up so fast
And say the friends that we'd become, can't hold on to the past
You said it's been a long, long time, since love came to an end
If I hadn't learned to draw the line, it's useless to pretend

But I didn't mean to say that
Somehow it just slipped out
I swear that I would take it back
If I could right now
All I ask is you believe
I'd forgotten where I was
With you there so close to me
I thought that we were still in love

I don't think I could take goodbye, that much is still the truth
Won't you forgive me just for one night, it's what a friend would do

'Coz I didn't mean to say that
Somehow it just slipped out
I swear that I would take it back

Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights Just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here, with that  look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

As just being touched by you

Got my directions but the road was rough
It's only the dream of a teenage queen
But somehow I made it through

And I'd love to see
Those faces of those friends I left behind
And even those who spoke for me
Just trying to be kind
And no one said I love you just the way
I know you do

And I love being in love with you

Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
Being in love forever
And ever, ever

I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It ain't right it's only for you and me
Only the lonely do it separately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few

Is trying to let go

A fool without a lover
How can that possibly be
Maybe you can show me why
I shiver when you're closer
I remember your touch without it
Let me drown in your ecstasy
It's got to be do or die

Don't tell me love is just one night
I know it's not true
There should be someone there to catch you
When the rain falls
And you can turn away my heaven
And maybe I was wrong
I depended on the inner voice of

Experience, or just imagination
Whatever you believe in, you can lose
And one way or the other, we can find
Another world we can run away to
I'm living for the
Experience, is only what you make it
You live forever but you never know
That somebody loves you 
And when the sky is open 
Fly away lovers can share
I'll be there 

And you can make the earth move
You can take me with no struggle
Lead me through your mystical dreams
Show me what you are
And we can make the wind blow
You're the power and I'm in it
You can be the fire I start
I want your heart

And let there be a story when the stories are told
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure
You can not ignore
I'll make it more than

Experience is not imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
Somebody loves you
I couldn't get no higher
Fly away lovers can share
And we'll be there

Experience is not imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
And one way or the other
We can find another world we can run away to

And somebody loves you

Diana Ross,"Didn't know 'til today
That you would love for me to say
All of things I feel
Though you don't doubt they're real
Insecure, very shy
Are the only reasons I have why
I never say the things that you would love to hear
All the words I try
Disappoint me and I cry
So they're words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why
Kinda sad, kinda blue
Because I wanted to tell you
That you were in my heart
Though we were far apart
Didn't know how to say
All the little things to make you stay
And not to keep assuming
You could read my mind
You're the one I love
Though it's hard for you to know
'Cause the words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why

It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
It seems like you built a fence around your heart

Afraid that sharing might tear it apart
You pass up every chance at the start of romance
Selfish one, why keep your love in store
You think it's still that keeps forever more

You feel as I do when I ache
My heart could break down in a lonely stage
You better let your heart find a man before it's too late
You let so much time pass by
I find myself still giving you the eye
You must have realized much to my surprise
You're making eyes at me

Is it really you
Now selfish one, you're walking me to my door
Selfish one, you never did this before
Without a chance to resist, your lips get mine
You're beginning to let your love light shine
I can see that you're really on the ball
You're not selfish at all
No, not at all

The way you hold me, the way you squeeze me
No you're not selfish
No, no, no

Diana Ross,"(wintley phipps)

You alone know how I feel down deep inside
I promised you I'll never stray from by your side
But now I'm looking back on all those yesterdays
The many times I let you down
I'm begging I can hear you say

Tell me again that you love me
And you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

I can tell when first we start to drift apart
The emptiness just takes hold of my wounded heart
You know I need to feel you by my side
'cause when the night is cold and I've been so bold
There's no need to hide

Just tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

And if you light the way
I will follow you into that land of gladness
No more sadness

Tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me
The love you have for me will never die

I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said you can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You gotta trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait how much more can I take
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hanging on
I remember mama said

Can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no
You just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

Here to stay is a new bird

Then pretend that he is parson brown
He'll say ""are you married?""
We'll say ""no man!
But you can do the job when you're in town""

To face unafraid, the plans that we've made

Since you went away from me

It was best for you and me

Since you went away from me
My whole life has made a change
Every day's a new day
(Every day's a new day)
Since you went away from me

You were my comfort zone
I depended on you for everything
I wanted in my life, yes I did
But now that you're gone
I'm doing just fine without you
How I bless the day you went away

Now I have a song inside
(Inside)
The birds sing to me
I finally can be
Free to spread my wings in harmony

Now the sun shines on me
(On me)
I have been set free
To collect my thoughts and jot them down
All this happiness I've found
Since you've been away

Since you went away from me

It may sound crazy, but I forgive you
And want the best for you
The circumstances came my way

Now I've learned to do for myself
And all the things I thought
That you would do for me
Like leaving me alone to go for my own
When you're not at home, I'm glad you're gone

Now I have a song inside

Free to spread my wings in harmony

Sometimes we're locked inside the prisons of our pride
And sometimes we break each others heart with the words we say

One thing we cannot change

We all have one heart
And one heart needs another
Love, love is all that matters
Love is all that matters, it matters after all

Sometimes we search this world for gold
When all we really need is just a hand to hold
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away
With words we forget to say too many times

But always after all, all
Love is all that matters
After everything, one thing remains the same
One thing we cannot change

We, we all have one heart
And one heart needs another

Love is all that matters, it matters after all

That you have turned to smiles
I can't believe we survived
All the endless miles
Two hearts broken together
Will heal into one

That's why I call you my friend
You will be my friend
Now 'till my life is ended

Sweet love and tenderness
All our hopes and dreams
Will take us through the hard times

Let winter come
As cold as it will be
My arms are open wide
You can just run to me
As warm as any summer
I am here for you

That's why I call you my friend
You will be my friend
Now 'till my life is ended
As friend",That's Why I Call You My Friend
Diana Ross,"Just close your eyes
And slowly drift away
Call the stars down from the skies
It's the end of another day

Let your spirits fly
Into this magic night
You should be fast asleep
Bathed in golden light

It's late at night
I watch you sleep
Holding you tight
My love will protect and keep you strong
All night long

Dreams are for dreamers
Who somehow lost their way
Once you find the secret
There's no need to be afraid
And tell the bad dreams to just go away

Dreams are like rainbows
Just follow where they lead
In your dreams you found the lock
In your prayers you'll find the key

My love will guide you
High above the stars
In dreams you can do many wonderful things
Even find out who you are

When you dream I'll be there
Just picture me in your mind
When you're scared
I'll take care of you

When you dream I'll be there
If you need someone to hold
Hold on to me
That's all you have to do
To make you dreams come true

Dreams can be magic
If the truth is what you seek
Open up your heart
And you'll be forever free
When you dream

And tell the bad dreams
To just go away...",When You Dream
Diana Ross,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me

You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone, alone, why

Just the other night
I thought i heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens i will bear
But first i need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
Whisper three words then i'll come running
And boy you know that i'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far away

You are not alone...",You Are Not Alone
Diana Ross,"Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do
I thought it was you
As he turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
'Cause you are everything
And everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you",You Are Everything [Duet with Marvin Gaye]
Diana Ross,"You say it's better to behave
Just like I never met you
Why is it only I can cry
And you can say goodbye in a minute
Don't you remember I was your friend
And you can just erase all those days
And those tender reflections we bear
We promised not to fall in love
But it was there and soon I was in it
Already I was more than your friend
It's harder for me

No words or expressions
Can make you hungry for me
I've never seen you on your knees
Like I'm beggin' you

Don't give up, give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around

Always and always
You told me love was ever and ever
Together the dream will come true
If we turn back
If you turn back to me

You won't be sorry if you stay
I'll stake my life upon it
Little flame inside us can be fed
Take our precious love to the limit
It's the one that you need and it's your friend
It's harder for me

No words or expressions
Anything that makes you worry
I've never seen you on your knees
And I'm in a hurry
How is it you can break my heart
But you can't be sorry
Push away whoever you please
But I'm begging you

Don't give up, give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
I'll never give another
Anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around, oh
Don't give up, give up on each other
We can't lose tomorrow
Better treasure what we've got
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you",Don't Give Up on Each Other
Diana Ross,"Hello baby, it's a long time
I know you're here
I feel you close to me
So much to say but
Making all the words
I save them all inside
Then I see you and they disappear
Like leaves beneath the snow
And life don't wait for everyone
And yesterday, I let you go

I'm watching you tonight
And I waited for so long
I've been living on your memory
In a world where we were one
And you told me you could make it on your own

I'm watching you tonight
And it's making me cry
When I lost you, I lost everything
But our love should never die
Not mine, my love is born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But the moment when I see me in your eyes
You're gone, you're gone

You can say goodbye if you want to
I love you but I'll try to understand
But in my soul I know it's meant to be
Together you and me

But I know you came to fade away
Like voices in the wind
And I wonder if you feel my love
It's stronger than it's ever been

I'm watching you tonight
And there's no other one
All the love we gave eternally
Now it's dying in the sun
Not mine, my love was born to be your love

Hey hey
I want to know, do you have style?
The kind of style that makes a woman want to lose her mind
And I want to know when you make it worth my time

Diana Ross,"Nothing has changed, same as it was
It's time to think about the future
Forget about the past
Once it's all gone, you can't go back
So, now, it's up to us to find a way
To try and make it last

[Chorus:]
Until you give your heart completely
Unless you take that chance
Then it can't happen
It's not all in vain
We can make a change
Just you and I

Everything is left in our hands
We've gotta make a resolution
We need a better plan
Don't go too slow
We must move fast
There has to be a way to make it work
To keep it in our grasp

[Chorus]

We gotta stay together
Gotta find a ray of hope in stormy weather
Trying to make it better
Till we find a way to make it last forever

Some things remain, others have gone
It's up to us to get solutions
We must come up with one
Can't get it wrong; it must be right
Because we lost too many battles
And we gotta win the fight

Diana Ross,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,

But that was many, many years ago
Abandoned in a pile of useless junk
I found her never to be lost again
While I'm around her
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old funky clothes
We don't care if folks are laughing
When we're on the road
Can't you feel that surge of power
Going 18 miles an hour
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
She ain't even paid for but she's mine I suppose
Once they tried to repossess her
But she wouldn't start
God bless her
Spunky hunk a junk my funky rolls
For 30 years she got by on her looks
That was chic, that was very chic
Her face appeared in all the motor books

Once a week each and every week
When they checked her gasket out
The old girl blew it
Funky was a lemon
She never knew it
But I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
She's got Plymouth headlights and
A tank full of holes
Once I thought I really lost her on Cid Boulevard
Funky found the love she needed
Metaphor, overheated
I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls

Diana Ross,"Who would have ever thought
The day could ever come
When we would see
A love like this fall into pieces

And it hurts me to know that now 'til then
I'll only have these memories
And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart until we meet again

Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again

Why while our love was strong, we still couldn't make it
Did time have to take our live in different directions
And it hurts cause there's no way for me to reach you
We're so far apart, when did we grow so far apart

And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again

Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again

Deep in my heart I know
I'll see you again well I don't know
Where or when but till then

And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again

Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again

And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again

Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me

You, you turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama

When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired

Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

Upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken

And now
My eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I
Remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever

And I follow your advise
You've been wrong

For this fairy tale thing called love?

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Right before my eyes

So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

Diana Ross,"I don't remember what day it was
I didn't notice what time it was
All I know is that I fell in love with you
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Every day's a new day in love with you
With each day comes a new way of loving you
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Oh, I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But, darling, not as much as tomorrow

Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away
Cupid, we don't need ya now, be on your way
I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger
And I always will be true, I know you feel the same way too

Oh, I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But only half as much as tomorrow

Every way's a new way, every time I love ya
Every day's a new day, every time I love ya
Every way's a new way, every time I love ya",More Today Than Yesterday

But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didn't seem to mind

I told him be on his way
But not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh then I knew
That he won my heart

So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh then I knew
That he won my heart

When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face

I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing

Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing

Might be a fantasy

Diana Vickers,"I see myself running
Around your wandering eyes, again
I wonder if you see me
With someone else I could never be

And I'm trying to find the moment I can ask you how you feel
And I'm trying to make this dream I had with you a little more real

Chasing you into the dark
Chasing you with all my heart
Don't turn around, don't let me down
You're more than I compare
You're everywhere
You're everywhere

I don't think you were with me
Holding me in your arms again
I lost myself in your presence
I lost myself in your everything

And I'm fighting past the fear of you pretending not to care
And I'm trying not to understand the need to have you here

Chasing you into the dark
Chasing you with all my heart
Don't turn around, don't let me down
You're more than I compare
You're everywhere
You're everywhere

There's nothing more that I can do
And Nothing I can say
I can't change my mind
And this feeling won't go away

Chasing you into the dark
Chasing you with all my heart
Don't turn around, don't let me down
Be here, be now, be every how

You were my lightning strike
And my knock on wood

Oh! I'm not naive
But I thought

Stood at the sides of empty floors
Like depressing pores on the rest of our lives

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

Waving tomorrow goodbye, a tear in my eye
Nothing can bring back that feeling
Go on fade out the stars in my sky, I'm wondering why

I put a broken dream next to the memory of you
And forever you'll be together till fate brings you somebody new
And I can't erase the look on your face

Swims through your eyes

To a wide vast dominion

Or place for the rage
No broken hearts
White wash lies
Just a taste for the truth
Perfect taste, choice and meaning
A look into your eyes

Blind to the gemstone alone

Should he stay or should he go?
Let him shout a rage so strong
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And take a little piece of you

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile

Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got
Does she know that’s all the love you got

And tell me does it feel the same
Is she close enough to hurt
When she takes it does it make it worse
Can you still kill a perfect day
With a twinkle in your eye
Do you still awake when she’s asleep

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile

Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got

I wake as I have always done
To freshly scented sycamore
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor

My steaming coffee warms my face
I'm disappointed in the taste
But there's a peace the early brings
The morning world of growing things

I feel the moment hurry on
It was today, it's died away
And now it is forever gone

And I will drink my coffee slow
And I will watch my shadow grow
And disappear in firelight
And sleep alone again tonight

Diane Horner,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.

I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

Diane Horner,"I've been a rock and I've got my fences
I never let them down

So I don't get kicked around
I shivered once, you broke into my soul
The damage is done now, I'm out of control
How did you get to me

No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way that you do 
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it

I can't deny you even when I catch you 
Weaving a weak alibi
Cause when the night falls, you make me forget

Diane Hubka,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus]

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night. 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead. 
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good, 
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood.",Lazy Afternoon
Diane Hubka,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage

Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then

That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently
We set apart
Things of the heart
And lost love long ago",Morning

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again

Diane Schuur,"Heaven sends 
A song through its doors 
Just as if it seems to know 
I'm exclusively yours 

Knowing this 
I feel but one way 
You will understand too 
In these words that I say 

I'll close my eyes 
To everyone but you 
And when I do 
I'll see you standing there 

I'll lock my heart 
To any other caress 
I'll never say yes 
To a new love affair 

Then I'll close my eyes 
To everything that's gay 
If you are not there 
Oh, to share each lovely day 

And through the years 
In those moments 
When we're far apart 
Don't you know I'll close my eyes 
And I'll see you with my heart

Take a holiday from the neighbourhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach
Or to Hollywood

In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
I know what I'm needing
I don't want to waste more time

Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take

Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Somehow I'm sure I found a sure thing in you
Something within tells me we'll win
Somewhere my heart has picked you out of the blue
And since I'm only a beginner, a winner I'll be

How it feels to waken

How to go on living
How to face another day

How it feels to walk alone
Listening for those footsteps
Through the echo of your own
Suddenly it hits you

Autumn tells the swallows
Time to fly
So why do we pretend
Till the bitter end
Till it breaks our hearts
To say good-bye

That it's just another fling
No one ever warns you
When your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later
All is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before

We can hear the thunder
Of the falls
So why do we go on
Sailing madly on
Till all we had is gone

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind

Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

Twelve drummers drumming, 
Eleven pipers piping, 
Ten lords a-leaping, 
Nine ladies dancing, 
Eight maids a-milking, 
Seven swans a-swimming, 
Six geese a-laying, 
Five golden rings, 
Four calling birds, 
Three French hens, 
Two turtle doves, 
And a partridge in a pear tree!

Diane Witherspoon,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Diane Witherspoon,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me

Diane Zeigler,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Dianna Corcoran,"The best days are the hardest days
The strongest people fight their way to the finish line
Pressure has a funny way
Of leaning on their stones until their diamond shines
Oh oh I’m gonna shine
I could wave a white flag and surrender
I could give up and say that I’m through
And in my moments of weakness
That’s something I am tempted to do
I might be ready to bend a little
Might be ready to break just a little
But I’m not ready to lose

When heartaches knocking at your door
And you wonder what are prayers for in the dead of night
The time for toughen up your skin
Can teach a heart that it can win the toughest fight
Oh I’m gonna fight
I could wave a white flag and surrender
I could give up and say that I’m through
And in my moments of weakness
That’s something I am tempted to do
I might be ready to bend a little
Might be ready to break just a little
But I’m not ready to lose

So the phone can ring
And will bring you news that will change your life
Maybe someone that you love maybe gone in the blink of an eye
That’s when you realize
You could wave a white flag and surrender
You could give up and say that I’m through
And in my moments of weakness
That’s something I am tempted to do

Might be ready to break just a little

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

While I'm alone and blue as can be

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head

Like a summer with a thousand July's

Dianne Nalini,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Dianne Reeves,"Silver gray hair neatly combed in place.
There were four generations of love on her face.
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes,
She'd seen it all.

I was a child, oh, about three or four.
All day I'd ask questions.
At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong ?
And why does what I want always take so long ?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me ?

I'd say, Grandma what is love ?
Will I ever find out ?
Why are we so poor, what is life about ?
I want to know the answers before I fall off to sleep.

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.
Grandma yawned as she stretched.
Then she started to speak.
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside.

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday.
But you have got to live in a patient way.
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days.

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.
Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right.
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night.
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient.

Later that year, at the turn of spring,
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused.
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised.
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say,
I can hear her say.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby.
(Be patient) Oh,  you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
Child, do you hear me, yeah.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh

She used to comb my hair
She used to tell me stories

Sharp as thumb tacks

Cold as silver
White as sheets

Like leaves

Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

And the bluest ink

Dianne Reeves,"Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day

Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
A vow that all betray

For the passions that thrill love
And take you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let it fall to hell

Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away

Dianne Reeves,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending
Unless, I could have one more chance to prove dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul

Dianne Reeves,"Weary feet on a dusty road
Country preacher comes to save your soul

Just after day break on each Sunday morning
You could see women, men, and children piling out
Of their homes in their Sunday go to meetin' clothes
""Ah uum""

Making their way up that long steep hill
To the house of the Lord to get their hearts fixed
And their minds regulated looking forward to hear
The word brought down from on high from the
Country preacher

Country preacher clears his throat
Say brothers and sister we are gather here this mornin'
To give praise to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
""Ah uum""

Cause everybody everybody's losing all their weariness in this place
Oh the spirit flowed like a mighty river

Dianne Reeves,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

They rain and snow on everyone

But clouds go in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down
And still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall

At all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show you leave
Them laughing when you go

And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take
And still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right aloud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now

Dianne Reeves,"Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one
Trav'ling this way?
How strange the road to love should be so easy
Can there be a detour ahead?

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart
Gullible clown, you fool
You're headed in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead?

The farther you travel
The harder to unravel the web he spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Can't you see the danger sign?

I'm turning back away from all this trouble

Come through my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom

On the wings of every kiss drifts a melody
So strange and sweet in this sentimental bliss
You make my paradise complete

Rose petals seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's a lighter thing since
You made this night a thing divine

Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day

When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always

Always long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

With your sincere emotion

Should I risk what is precious, my friend

For a fated end

Leaves me shaken and sober

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace

Oh I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene

I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long, I'd teach my feet to fly
Wish I had a river, I could skate away on

I made my baby cry, he tried hard to please me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

I need a river, I could skate away on

You see I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've lost the best baby that I, that I ever had

Dianne Reeves,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne

I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me 
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for.
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds
And I just wanna testify
Too much joy, can't keep it to myself, I feel the need to tell somebody else
And I just wanna testify
Gifts of love that we all need, are provided if we only plant the seeds
And I wanna plant the seeds and testify.
I just wanna testify.

I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.

You've got me on the go!

What a mess you're making!

Why I'm always shaking

Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done.

But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream
Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream
Darn that one-track mind of mine
I can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare
Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

When a Broadway baby says good night,
It's early in the morning.

Until the dawn.

It's like a dream
Things are not quiet what they seem
There's always something missing, something unseen but indeed remembered
I think a pass I might have taken lives I'd have changed
Some living living souls rearranged and I'm amazed how tender feelings can be
In looking back we just peek through the cracks between what's real and false
In this eternal waltz meanwhile we just keep dancing
Now at the end of my reflection
I have to say I would live life the same way
But that's the way that life goes
Thank God I'm a woman who knows

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that this never will be

Like a summer with a thousand Julys

Last night I was watching old Tom Nix
My TV broke, I was in a fix
I Got on the phone, and called my man,
Said get here daddy as fast as you can
TV is the thing this year, oh
TV is the thing this year,
Radio was great, but now it's out of date
And TV is the thing this year
Now he turned my dial to channel one
I knew that this was gonna be fun
He turned my dial to channel two
That station thrilled me through and through
He moved one notch to channel three
I said oh how I love what you're doin' to me
He said, wait a minute, let's try channel four
Just about that time someone knocked on the door
TV is the thing this year, oh yes

Radio was great, now it's out of date

The way he eased into channel five
That man musta had fluid drive
He moved once more to channel six
Then he opened up his bag of tricks
On channel seven the show was late
But we got our kicks on channel eight
He turned my dial to channel nine
Said Baby, your set is workin' fine
He moved on up to channel ten
Then we started all over again
He finally hit channel eleven
I cried mama, he treats your daughter so good!

Dianne Reeves,"I'm in love again
And the feeling's not new
Yes, I know the signs
And I know what to do

It's a highway
That I have traveled through before
So I know all the curves
And I've come back for more

[Chorus]
Here I go again
The way that I always do
Cause I'm in love again
All over again with you

I'm alive again
I can wake up and sing
Nothing bores me now
I enjoy everything

Dianne Reeves,"Each day through my window I watch him as he passes by
I say to myself, ""You're such a lucky girl""
To have a boy like him is truly a dream come true
Out of all the girls in the world he belongs to me

[Chorus]
But it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
It was just imagination runnin' away with me

Soon we'll be married and raise a family
Have a cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you I, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

[Chorus]

Every night on my knees I pray, dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take his love from me or I will surely die
His love is heavenly when his arms enfold me I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality he doesn't even know my name, oh what a shame

For it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
And runnin' and runnin'

[Chorus]

Just my imagination
In the windmills of my m ind I would think about him all the time
Just my imagination
But he didn't even know my name, oh what a shame
Well, it was just my imagination",Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)
Dianne Reeves,"Loving you is easy cause your beautiful
Making love with you is all I wanna do
Loving you is more than just a dream come true
And everything that I do is out of loving you

No one else can make me feel the colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in the spring time
Loving you has made my life so beautiful
And everyday of my life is filled with loving you

Loving you I see your soul come shining through
Every time that we, I'm more in love with you

Dianne Reeves,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice
Warmer than a summer night
But clouds were like a alabaster palace
Rising to a snowing height
Each star its own aura borealis
Suddenly you held me tight
And I could see the midnight sun

I cant explain the silver ring that found
Or was that a moonlight vale
The music of the universe surround me
Or was it that a nightingale
And then your arms miraculously found me
Suddenly the sky turned pale
And I could see the midnight sun

Was there ever such a night
Its a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve
The flame of it may twiddle to remember
And the stars forget to shine

And we may see a meadow in December
I see white and crystal light
But oh my darling ill always remember
When your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun

The flame of it may twinkle like 
An amber in the stars forget to shine
And we may see a meadow in December
I see white and crystal light
But oh my darling ill always remember
When your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun
We saw the midnight sun

I can see the midnight sun, yeah
What a weekend",Midnight Sun
Dianne Reeves,"Once, I loved
And I gave so much love to this love 
You were the world to me
Once, I cried 
At the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye
Then one day 
In my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again
Now I know 
That no matter whatever befalls
I'll never let you go
I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away

Dianne Reeves,"Packing my crib and I'm taking a trip out of town
Over the weekend
Must have a change from the sight of this strange lonely town
Over the weekend

Far from the noise of the crowd
There must be some place for me
Where I can shout to the clouds
Shout that I'm free

High on a mountain top
Time and the world will stop, I know what ill find
Love uninhibited, nothing prohibited
If its insane I don't care, let me lost my mind

Monday will seem as unreal as a dream in the night 
Over the weekend
Back on the train I could never explain my delight
Over the week end

Will I have any regrets
Back in the hole in the wall?
How long before I could get
The thrill of it all?

I think that I can hold on
To love when it's over and gone
I'll let the curtain descend
Over the weekend

Oh, oh, what a dream, what at time, oh, what a day
Oh, love, love, love
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know

I wanna shout from the highest mountain top
Oh, what a night, it was right
Right here, right now",Over the Weekend
Dianne Reeves,"I been to pass your doorway
Gave you a buzz, that's all
Lately I thought all about you
So I thought I'd pay a social call

Do you recall the old days
We use to have a ball
Not that I'm lonesome without you
I thought I'd just pay a social call

I lie and say things are just swell
But to tell the truth
I haven't been too well
And if you should try to kiss me
I wouldn't even stall
Maybe we'll get back together
Starting with incendental, elemental
Simple social call
Yeah

Being here with you again
Has brought such precious memories
Awaking many feelings
I feel so alive again
Sitting here talking to you
Late into the night
Feels like we've never ever been apart
You've always been in my heart

I vividly remember things we used to do and say
And laugh and dance and ooh
You were my boo
How we ever parted 
I guess life just ends up being
Then we went our separate ways

Singing has been so amazing
So many wonderful things
I've worked for, prayed for
Have filled my days
But while this fabulous life is taking place
That one special love has not filled sacred space 

Now I feel the heat, the fire, the sweetness
As you hold me in your arms
There's no way I want to go
But baby, take it slow
Let's do some laughing, dancing
Dreaming and romancing
Ooo let's give it a go

I lie and say things are just swell
But to tell the truth
I haven't been too well
And if you should try to kiss me

You'll never let him go
'Cause you know and you know that you know

Of your heart, there's no way you can wait till tomorrow

Like a wheel within a wheel

Like a carousel thats turning

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping 
Past the minutes on its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern 
Where the sun has never shone

Like a door that keeps revolving 
In a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble

Words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly?
Was it something that I said?

Lovers walk along the shore
And leave their footprints in the sand 
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or a fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of his hair?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Dice Raw,"[Verse 1]
Since I been peein' straight, striaght crime's been my mindstate
Proud to be a petty thief ever since four feet
But I make dis records so rappers would have to advance
And stop wearin' the same corny watches and leather pants
Psych, I don't give a fuck, rock your ice
Just don't step out of line or you'll get rocked by Dice
I toured around the world like Tina and Ike
Brought the house down in Sicily and Milan
Fucked all types of women like your sister and mom
Ask around your breakfast table, you'll say ""Raw's the bomb""
Slow down son, you can't go one round with Dice, dude
I make clowns like you bow down like Ice Cube
Women, I make 'em feel like they gave birth to God
Grip 'em by their pigtails, make 'em slurp the rod
Catch a Mack-11 slug with a pair of chopsticks
Cut a priest off at the funeral to rock shit

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm the real Raw, all y'all others be fakin'
Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin'
Talkin' all that shit like you can get some
You just a sucka, you can't get a fuckin' crumb
Man I'm the real Raw, all y'all others be fakin'
Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin'
Talkin' all that shit like you can get some
You just a sucka, and can't get a fuckin' crumb

[Verse 2]
I ain't lettin' niggas rap no more without my approval or stamp
I'm drunk on power, I don't feel the weed or the champ'
Voices like a million watts pumpin' out, goin' amped
Hit niggas bang pow to the moon like Ralph Kramp
Once I'm there, carve the moon into a pair of dice
Or put a star in a jelly jar and use it for a night light
Give it to my daughter, bomb your headquarters
It's Dice, here I am rare despite all denial
Just raw ass lyrics, no self-proclaimed titles
Whip out what I'm concealin', then aim for survival
Seein' is believin', my fist is an eyeful
Dice is raw, there ain't no mistakin'
Me against y'all is like Santa against Satan
When I say y'all, I mean y'all suckas that be rappin'
You're soft like satin from hard skull crackin', aiyyo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So MCs that want to battle, step up reluctantly
If Jesus could rap, He couldn't fuck with me

(beat stops, thunder rolls, beeps and buzzes)

Yo, yo what the fuck is that?  Aiyyo, what happened to the beat?
What's goin' on in there, man?

     Hey Dice, man what the fuck are you in there doin', man?
     The fuckin' board's smokin'; there's all this type of fire and shit, man.
     I know your budget's not gonna cover this shit, man.
     This session is shut down!

[Verse 4: Dice Raw as God]
Dice!  You dare blasphemy against thy Lord?
I can do anything, even rhyme!

The builder and destroyer of all worlds
Creator of man, woman, girl
Some call Me Allah, Yahweh, Jehovah
I can start a beginnin', or endin', it's over
On Earth's first day alive there was darkness
Shape was worthless, I gave this small planet purpose
Breathed life into the surface
And created every beast in the sea
Feast eyes on the Son of God for thou souls to free
Since the Garden of Eden, I told men believe in
Thou Lord, and never worship falseships and act accord
But always, serpents slither across floors
Everything that is, always has been, always will be
A chill in your bones is how you feel me
At the end, when the moon turns blood and the sun blackens
Great men of the world running wonder what's happenin'
The sky'll part
And where I once said ""Let there be light,"" I'll say ""Let there be dark""
After the lamb's spoken, last seal's broken
Trumpets sound, last men on Earth found chokin'
For these events not to take place, you're hopin'
Balls of energy fly from my hands explodin'",Brain Softener
Dice Raw,"[Chorus 2x]
Now do you want it?  (Hell yeah nigga, I want it)
And do you need it?  (Yeah, I need it, man)
Well, they got it (They got what?)
Everything, so let's take it (Take, take, let's take it)

[Verse 1]
Niggas can act like, act like they, they want it
Knowin' that they don't want jackshit, them niggas fronted
When it came down to stackin' mills and smackin' grills
Them patty-cake niggas thought that they needed to chill
When all the real nigga feels is a need to kill
Unrevealed, the catastrophic, we gotta stop it
They tryin' to kill us, so all my niggas better watch it
Tap water and Newports, yo man, that's that hot shit
Mixed with Hennessey and a blunt, it gets toxic
But fuck it, pass the la, let's get high
I'm goin' in shootin', does any man wish to die?
This ain't metal gear, solid, you can't pause my killin'
I'm bustin', lick off them head for a schillin'
I can't be happy, 'cause what's happy?
I'm from a place where everyone's strapped and tryin' to clap me
Flesh and bone turn to stone, so if you want it, ask me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you and I, me and you, we ever verse
Then I don't know yo, the shots might disperse
'Cause I got, got you on scope, kid, hundred yards away
Grassy Knoll raw dog might blow that ass away
Talk, talkin' that dumb shit, caps I'm peelin' it
This be a-ro-ro-rockin', all ya feelin' it
My gat, concealin' it, fuck that, revealin' it
Let the young brothas know beef, then how to kill it
Or get your face slammed on a skillet and then you're sauteed
A new law's laid, it's the Raw Brigade
Or Raw Family Stone
Hammer and hip-hop goin' straight up to your dome
Keepin' your own words shinin' just like chrome, so what?
If y'all want something over here, then come get a piece
I'll damn sure cut y'all a slice
But ya might lose your life when ya gamble with Dice

[Chorus]",If You Want It
Dice Raw,"[Verse 1]
The whole goddamn world's on fire, and it's burinin' like a stack of logs
Beware if your pockets resemble a catalog
That's fat, down here niggas got cattle prods
What's that?  Fuck it man, it's all gone to the dogs
In fact, it's like a fuckin' sauna, it gets so hot
Sometimes you just want to, you know, ka-ka-KLOCK
Ka-ka-KLOCK KLOCK for no reason
That's why you breathin', fuck do y'all niggas believe in?
It's lava, clips, revolvers, there's eruptions
Everytime niggas be like ""Whassup then?""
And you can feel the tension vibratin' off a brick
Babies hangin' like cell phones (?)
Fuck the feds, when you see the CIA on your strip
You MIA out this bitch, you can't play with these pigs
Niggas are trippin' and I'm flippin', straight stick the clip in
Back me up against the wall, Raw starts spittin'

[Chorus 2x]
Yo, it's so much drama, who do we shoot at first?
As time goes on, the fire burns, it gets worse
It's a million degrees, and the street's about to burst
Because the ghetto's the hottest show on Earth

[Verse 2]
Shit be gettin' wilder and crazier by the millisecond
Walk around protected, or walk around naked
'Cause nothing's sacred, not even Granny's tennis bracelet
She gave you on her deathbed, niggas'll still take it
Man, I was raised on a constitution written by thugs
Niggas that G, kill, lie like prayer rugs
It's deranged, pocket full of shells like loose change
It's fucked up when your bull start actin' strange
I seen people give up lifelong dreams for gravy
Get snitched on by their team, or set up by their lady
Who gives a fuck?  Not even us, 'cause God (?) all I trust
But, my first thought is to bust, can you dig it

[Chorus]

Yo, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up
Yeah, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up
Yeah, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up
Yeah, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up

Yo, they got us locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Yo, they got us locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Every artist locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Every rapper locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound

Man, it used to feel like hip-hop had a lock on my soul
And a deal was the only way I'd get parole
I got knocked years ago when I wrote my first rhyme
Ever since then, I been locked down doin' time
Payin' dues with a lot to gain, but more to lose
I play the game, but they keep changin' the rules
The studio's a holding cell for lyrical criminals
Doing demo tapes, hold mics like shanks
Battlin', that's like a fight in the yard
Lines chase niggas down like Lieutenant Gerard
But I love it there, and some say that I'm institutionalized
Freestyling's our only form of exercise
I don't lift weights, lift my mind to a higher state
If your shit's wack, you just can't relate
I have nightmares of bein' back on the streets
But when I wake up in my cell, I feel relief
Bein' on tour is like bein' transferred to jail
And the companies reattempt to boost your sales
In my last case, they came at me with a deal
The D.A., I mean A&R, said ""You can still keep shit real
But instead of Raw, be Dice Chill
Give us some hits with some commercial appeal""
I refused, then sent back to my cell
And from next time, a poet's memoirs from jail

[Chorus:]

The prisoner, verbal incision
They strangle me with barbed wires of fire, fuck a mainstream vision
The label is the feds, they want to find me and sign me
With a market and promotion behind me, but they slimy
My cellmate Dice Raw is nice, why'all
I assassinate rehearsal, if I go commercial I'll slice why'all
Studio's solitary, so I'm soliterrorizin' MCs
Steve G's, freeze, melt, refreeze
Mics get raped on my cell block, we battle for commissary
Parole boards for adversary
I lost the trial, I lost the case
What a waste, judge threw the rhyme book in my face
But my brain left and right is like the unstoppable engine
Locked down, pushin' for mainstream like syringes
Fuck a C.O., my shit's gone gold like C3PO
Ask Kelo, he know we go T-O
The top, this is cell block hip-hop
Yo, the underground keep the shank hot
Locked down with MCs doin' life bids
Beware when the pen zags and zigs

[Chorus:]

Aiyyo, it was far from warm, the middle of a storm
And fifth Dynasty was on our way to perform
It was me, Steve G's, Dice and the Quick Drawn
And we got pulled over, we knew something was wrong
The law wasn't concerned with license and registration
Insurance information, or our point of destination
But peep, they got us up out the Jeep five deep
And took a look and saw the mics up under the seat
And start'd snappin', flippin' and shit like ""Who's rappin'?""
Got on the radio and signaled back to the captain
Who warned them we was known for action
""Use caution, and get them contracts from when they brought us back"" and
The fingerprints matched and linked identities
D.T.s was like ""Shit, it's the fifth MCs""
Ain't no escapin', locked us in a lab and started tapin'
Mandatory, the judge said ""Fuck jury deliberation""
Maximum incarceration
In these camps for concentration we call radio stations
A place where hip-hoppin' is against the law
Forever locked down within a lower corridor
Of sound, where they sniff out cells with bloodhounds
Pure MCs, MCs' remains is found
Pick the park when a record executive's around

And I begin to think it's true
It's awful hard to love someone
When they don't care about you

But now she's gone and left me
She done turn me down

Now I ain't got nobody, and nobody cares for me!
That's why I'm sad and lonely,
Won't somebody come and take a chance with me?

Dick Curless,"What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.",Great Speckled Bird

A lad stood alone in tears
For he had just said goodbye
To the one he had loved through the years.
He stood all alone with his head bowed down
As though his heart would break
Then the parson came over and took his hand
And to him these words he did say.

When God comes and gathers his jewels
All his treasures of diamonds and gold
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers his jewels.

Each night when the pale moon is shining
You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted to'ard heaven
He's repeating these words he was told.

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Dick Curless,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, 
As I walked out in Laredo one day, 
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen, 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Singy the Death March as you carry me along. 
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, 
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."" 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by. 
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story; 
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!"" 

""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water 
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said. 
Before I returned his spirit had left him 
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead. 

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",Streets of Laredo

Dick Curless,"What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield you; you will find a solace there.

Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised Thou wilt all our burdens bear
May we ever, Lord, be bringing all to Thee in earnest prayer.
Soon in glory bright unclouded there will be no need for prayer

The back seat's piled high with things in the front seat

So, you can be the girl you want to be
Go get 'em little miss up-town
Ride high ride free
But say goodbye to January April and me
The tiny rocker teddy bear and dolls are gone
And won't be in your way
I forget that al' pipe you never liked
Just throw it away

And knowing you'll be a part of all we do

Dick Dale,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet

Thus every kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender
Some social join and leagues combine
Some solitary wander
Avaunt! Away! the cruel sway,
Tyrannic man's dominion
The sportsman's joy, the murdering cry
The fluttering, gory pinion

But Peggy dear the evening's clear
Thick flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the fields in view 
All fading green and yellow
Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of nature
The rustling corn, the fruited thorn
And every happy creature

We'll gently walk and sweetly talk
Till the silent moon shines clearly
I'll grasp thy waist and, fondly pressed,
Swear how I love thee dearly
Not vernal showers to budding flowers
Not autumn to the farmer
So dear can be as thou to me
My fair, my lovely charmer",Now Westlin Winds
Dick Gaughan,"I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always
Let it be me

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And say you'll always
Let it be me",Let It Be Me
Dick Gaughan,"I'll sing you this October song
There's no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the still of evening
Birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows lying

When hunger calls my footsteps home
The morning follows after
L swim the seas within my mind
And the pine trees laugh green laughter

L used to search for happiness
L used to follow pleasure
But l found a door behind my mind
And that's the greatest treasure

For rulers like to lay down laws
And rebels like to break them
And the poor priests like to walk in chains

L met a man whose name was time
He said I must be going
But just how long ago that was
L have no way of knowing

Sometimes l want to murder time
Sometimes when my heart's aching
But mostly l just stroll along
The path that he is taking

I'll sing you this October Song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the cool of evening
The birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

",October Song
Dick Gilroy,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Dick Gilroy,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Dick Gilroy,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Dick Griffin,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo
Dick Hafer,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me"
Dick Hafer,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely
