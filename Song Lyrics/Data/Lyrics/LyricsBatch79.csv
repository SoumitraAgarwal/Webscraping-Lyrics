E-Rotic,"I want you to leave 
The party is over 
My mind is a thief 
My soul is a rover 
May be someday I'll miss you 
Somewhere at night 

Baby hearts are a changing 
And love sometimes dies 
And we all have to listen 
To sad lullabies 
Baby hearts are a changing 
They follow the tide 
We keep feeling forever 
The pain so deep inside

Our love was so true 
As deep as the ocean 
But shadows of blue

E-Rotic,"Why did our feelings die in action
When we fought for satisfaction
But our hearts sent S.O.S. save me
Why did our love lose all it's magic
Missing you is kinda tragic
We were heading for the best

In the heat of the night
Much too close to the fire
And the power of our hearts
Make us weak by desire
In the heat of the night

I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
But our heaven had no ceiling
Now it seems we've lost our love, forever
Stay, can't you hear my heart is calling
Only you can stop me falling
Just one kiss would be enough

In the heat of the night
Much too close to the fire
And the power of our hearts
Make us weak by desire
In the heat of the night

In the heat of the night
There is no one to blame
It can heal all the pain

Missing you 

So many nights of loneliness

Can't you see I'm still missing you 
Miss the magic of love that's around you

E-Rotic,"You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When I was lonely
And your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever

I was walking alone on the desperate
Sands of twilight island
And my dreams of love and understanding
Seemed to die in the cold of the night
I was in danger of losing my soul 
But then your hand touched mine

Oh baby you found me just in time
When the nightmares were calling
Shadows of fear were on my mind
And my heart was crying

You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When I was lonely
And your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever

You lit a light in the fog of frustration
So I could find the way out
And your love sent a guarding angel to help me
You made me feel sure that I wasn't alone
On twilight island anymore

Oh baby you made my blind eyes see
When I thought I was dying
Gone were the winds that tortured me
And then I stopped crying

Taking a walk along the river

Together with a young girl

Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he
Likes to play

You're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price

In paradise
And one day you'll
Find out he
Wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angel eyes

Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought
I could never live without him

Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back
All the pain
How can I forget that name

But yo, life is hell and that that's grown to be expected.
The only way to cope with the pain is to accept it. times is
Hectic, we grow up quick. endure the hardships and watch
Our skin grow thick. in turn. you gotta learn my heads as
Hard as a brick, so can't nobody ever tell me shit. and
That's the truth. as youth I hated all of you with a passion.
Those who never stood in my shoes would be laughing
And cracking jokes while their two folks raked in the

Ain't never did shit I was told. I get too mad too

Maybe I scream too loud...but what goes in,
Must come out. and I'm hurting inside. I can't
Show it. obstructed by pride. I ain't being hard I
Just don't know why. fuck tomorrow if I live or
I die. who comes first? you not before i. I'm still
A ways off from my lofty goals, so fuck those
Who oppose and those who's acting like ho's. I
Ain't got time for ya'll. focus my goals. I chose.

Do you listen? do you pay attention? pay attention. kids are
Starving for attention. for so long. ask yourself, where did
We go wrong?

You don't forgive.
All I see is the evil that surrounds me.

it's amazing how quickly the mind matures
When the world outside creates internal war.
I know, I know what's right... I do the wrong thing.

May the fire in my eyes light the way for me.
May the bridges that I burn take out my enemies.

Pissed on it and put your dick in. I couldn't believe every
Night I pray ""help me please"" down on my knees. and
You never answered me.
One foot in the grave. no you cannot be saved. it's what
You thought I should be. you can't fight destiny.

To stand alone against the tide of tears

Tell me, if there is a chance... 

I fell like I fall from the sky 
I wonder where you are 
I never did understand why 
You had to go that far.... 

I feel like I fall from the sky 
I wonder where you are 
I never did understand why 
You had to go 

We could have had all we wanted 
Do you remember all the things we said 
Or have you lost that sense of freedom we hunted 
Are all the dreams we had forgotten and dead?

E.M.P.C.,"See me loving you
A fool without a lover
How can that possibly be
Maybe you can show me why
I shiver when you're closer
I remember your touch without it
Let me drown in your ecstasy
It's got to be do or die

Don't tell me love is just one night
I know it's not true
There should be someone there to catch you
When the rain falls
And you can turn away my heaven
And maybe I was wrong
I depended on the inner voice of

Experience, or just imagination
Whatever you believe in, you can lose
And one way or the other, we can find
Another world we can run away to
I'm living for the
Experience, is only what you make it
You live forever but you never know
That somebody loves you 
And when the sky is open 
Fly away lovers can share
I'll be there 

And you can make the earth move
You can take me with no struggle
Lead me through your mystical dreams
Show me what you are
And we can make the wind blow
You're the power and I'm in it
You can be the fire I start
I want your heart

And let there be a story when the stories are told
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure
You can not ignore
I'll make it more than

Experience is not imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
Somebody loves you
I couldn't get no higher
Fly away lovers can share
And we'll be there

Experience is not imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
And one way or the other
We can find another world we can run away to
And I love you
Experience is only what you make it
You come together when you let yourself go
And somebody loves you
I couldn't get no higher
Fly away lovers can share
And we'll be there

Motherfuckers be a fool, skipping school with snakes
Old dumb ass nigga, can't pass the ties test

For this year 2000, I sell my bricks on the internet
Man I'ma wreck, break boys off and keep flossing
Prepare to roll, like I'm Stone Cold Steve Austin
Boss hogging big balling, me falling nigga never
Wide body Denali, metallic gray matching leather
Put it down for whatever, big Benz blue lens

I suggest you stay humble, keep from falling under
Hit the block drop the top, eight 15's of thunder
Let's get ready to rumble celebrating all night
Do a song one day, while two gray fog lights
Top doller rottweiler, fighting pits no poodles
Millionaires still eating, Chimmy Chang's and noodles
Lamborghini's fettuccine, electric gates with genies
Codeine and Crystal, end and martinis

Tailor made taper fade, on the cover of GQ screaming

Beach house by the docks, candy yacht bass fishing
Eddie Bauer Expedition, goin' be infloyd
2000 drop dogs, thank Gotti and Todd
Swift and Ken with skin, with two Canadian hoes
No pouring up of pints, syrup stains on the road
Tyte Eyez and Ronnie, D, Dolla and Reck
Need two forms of I.D., to cash this fat ass check
Almost wrecked the Vette, doing a hundred kilometers
So much ice in my mouth, I done cracked the thermometer
Ninja bikes for the summer, we Southside stunners
Boys got plex, you best to take a fucking number
Might as well call the plumber, they bust they windpipes
Screaming here they come, when they saw them new lights
It'll be alright, when I get seven figgas
And be in the basement, with that nigga named Tigga living

Yes we are, yes we are
Ooh, we getting money - 3x
Man, I done came a long way
Now all my people getting money, like the song say

[E.S.G.]
Now what you know bout sleeping on old sheets, and wasn't no silk
I was coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs, but wasn't no milk
And when the heat was turned off, I grabbed my grandma quilt
Man I swear times was hard, mama look what you built
The other kids use to laugh, and say our clothes was stole
You almost got caught, stealing games from my Nintendo
My little brother didn't know, and I ain't say nothing
I use to love when you bring the Jabos, and Polos with the buttons
I gotta tell you mama dearest, I love you to death
Made a kid from the projects, win best dressed
I'm one of the best up out the Southwest, ES the name
We having a ball, like a income tax check done came
No more sitting at home, and rolling blunts all day
Doing a in-store, I'm on to all work and no play
Even if it's mimimum wage, at least you getting paid
Put your drinks in the air, if you getting money (hey)

[Hook]
Yes we are, getting it
Yes we are, getting it
(broke days, was the worst days
Now we sip champagne, when we thirst-ay)
Yes we are, getting it
Yes we are, getting it
Yes we are getting it, M-O-N-E-why fa sho

[E.S.G.]
This for my Master P's, P. Diddy's and Russell Simmon's
All my Snoop's and Ice Cube's, that's Hollywood pimping
All my independent bouncers, that ain't thinking bout stopping
Look at old J from Rap-A-Lot, he making millions from boxing
Ain't no job oppritunities, in my community
You don't believe me Mr. President, well come and see
Old lady up the street, bless her heart she mad
Cause the city built a street, cut her garden in half
And the mayor won't answer back, heard she got cancer black
Some can't afford treatment, how he gon explain to that
Couldn't hold her pain back, couldn't bring her brain back
But it still remain the facts, money could of changed that g'yeah

[Hook]

[Intro]

[E.S.G.]
Now get your money peeps, if you in the streets or a athlete
If you jump out the gym, get insurance on your feet
Know that pro money sweet, million dollar occupation
In case you don't make it, homie grab your education
Don't want to wind up, been a should'a-would'a-could'a
Remember no cool-Aid, mixing water with the sugar
People forgetting who helped em out, I ain't quitting or selling out
Get your money coast to coast, cause we getting it down South

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Now ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to propose a toast, that's right
Everyone 21 and over, grab your drinks
Ya underage grab your cool-Aid, cause it's still playa
But check it out, this one here is dedicated
To everybody who had it hard in they life
Cause homie I know I struggled, but you know what mayn

E.S.G.,"(*talking*)
Man, on a normal occasion
I'd tell you to roll something up
Po some'ing up, but I ain't feeling that way
Everytime I turn around, another funeral
Another away man, how much can we take feel this

[E.S.G.]
I'm riding one deep with my gun, naw I ain't having fun
Wondering how to break the news, to my partna lil' son
His daddy probably the saw the angels, death he couldn't stop it
But God, why'd you have to take my dog Todd Prophet
Already lost Mello, now who gon be next
Think I'm feeling safe fake ass rappers, having plex
Who you playing with, don't take your life for granted
So many good people, seem to be the victims on the planet
Can't understand it, now which religion talking noise
Them Catholic priests, be touching on lil' boys
Can't trust your homeboys, you drop em off at home
He call his partna on the phone, they done broke in your home
Now what's wrong, said the Lord people dying too often
With no health or no insurance, can't afford no coffin
So today no flossing, another wake at eight o'clock
Jam Master Jay wasn't a gangsta, but he still got shot what's up

[Hook: (Kirby)]
My partna use to be a baller but
(now he's gone, ah-oooh)
And all I can tell his son, is
(try to hold on, ah-oooh)
Yeah she use to be a star, but
(now she's gone, ah-oooh)
Hey mama, they thought your son wouldn't make it but
(I stayed strong, ah-oooh)

[E.S.G.]
Now lil' Tamika up the street, wanted a baller real bad
Only 16, but already giving up the ass
You got cash you could smash, you don't have to ask
She needed money for clothes, so she stayed skipping class
Catch her flipping in a Jag, or flipping in the Lex
Laughing at the nerdy chicks, who believed in safe sex
She had one baby, had twins then another
Now didn't slow at 18, all living with her mother
Steady bouncing out of town, rent-a-cars with crack
Missing her kids birthday, what kind of mother is that
The ass started getting flat, without using Metabolife
Whole neighborhood wondering, if Tamika on the pipe
Strip clubs late at night, with bags under her eyes
Had the flu for three months, feeling like she bout to die
Boyfriends disappeared, and so did the queen
HIV in her bloodstream, girl died ay 19 damn

[Hook]
[E.S.G.]
Now Lord I know, I'm in the valley of death
And can't no man predict, how many days he got left
Use to run the street, with some devilish ass demons
High on dust not giving a fuck, smoking wet steady scheming
Had to change my ways, and go another route
Now I use the studio, to let my pain out
No more chasing dreams, gotta make it on my own
Can't be waiting on the next man, gotta get my hustle on
Now in case you ain't know this, playboy I'm focused
Only got one chance, no way in hell I can blow this
Turn my last five dollas, into a quarter million
But money can't change, the fucking pain that I'm feeling
From Chris, Paul to Tremain, who else gon go
They even killed Romeo, from the Steve Harvey show
Said I'd be dead in a year, that was two years ago
Thank the Lord I'm still here, hope I live to see mo' let's roll

It will last forever

And we know that our love will decide
Our true love will survive

And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus

Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust

Better yet

Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle

A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain

Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

Just call me your daddy O

Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid

I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control

Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got

For us to turn its way instead

Have come to visit me so clear
Beyond the third dimension
Beyond what I can see
I cannot touch what touches me
Under my skin
The feelings begin
I know you're there, I sense you
The air is thick where it was thin
So I rebuke the darkness
And I lift up my fear
Believing they will disappear
Beyond the third dimension
Beyond what I can see
I cannot touch what touches me

What more can I say than reason he was gone

What more can.....can I say

Of blowing a brother away

I take my gun and I give it to my prey
I turn my back to him and start to walk away

I could sure use the money, but I´m ashamed to ask

The traffic has buried all of last night´s rain
The words are all different but the accent is the same

The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between

There´s at least ten different strains of smoke in the air
And my prints are on them all, to prove I was there
And I love the curses, but I´m not one for the trenches
And I do love the walking, but thank god for the benches

It´s hard to tell where green begins, and the city gray stops
I guess the trees all bought their armor at second hand shops
My second had is working, but the minute hand is broke again
I know time will pass, but I don´t know when

The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
And there are no shades of gray in between
I know the great ones have been here, but where I can't tell
there's dreams here a plenty, but they're being withheld
And I'm more impressed with the closed doors than the ones that are open
The whole place tells time by a tower clock that's broken

The pigeons are ravens, and the gulls are vultures
And trash is art, and cash is culture

The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
There are no shades of gray in between
There are no shades of gray in between",Shades of Gray

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night

I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down

With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms; they fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said, tell me, oh, tell me, was I alright?

It ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows
And dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side

Go 'round with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell the dancer
From the dance

Eagles,"There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go.
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child,
And I have loved you in a tame way,
And I have loved you wild.

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

There are stars in the southern sky.
And if ever you decide you should go,
There is a taste of time sweet and honey

Eagles,"Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might lose
After the thrill is gone

The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone  oh
After the thrill is gone

What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well

Time passes and you must move on,
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone

You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of lovin' at all, well

Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose

Eagles,"Out in the shiny night
The rain was softly falling
The tracks that ran down the boulevard
Had all been washed away

Out of the silver light the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh it seemed like a holy place
Protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud
The things we could not say
We thought we could change this world
With words like ""love"" and ""freedom""
We were part of the lonely crowd
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh, expecting to fly,
We would meet on that shore in the
Sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true,
Some just passed away
And some of the stayed behind
Inside the Sad Cafe.

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by,
And wonder at the powers that be.
I don't know why fortune smiles on some
And lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly,
If they ever change at all
There's no use in asking why,
It just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby
Inside the Sad Cafe.

You say he's a liar and he put out your fire,
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

You got your stories to tell.
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well.

Against your skin so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight

On the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul

You don't already know how to go
And I got a peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down

As you stumble to your bed 
You'd give anything to silence 
Those voices ringing in your head 
You thought you could find happiness 
Just over that green hill 
You thought you would be satisfied 
But you never will- 
Learn to be still 

We are like sheep without a shepherd 
We don't know how to be alone 
So we wander 'round this desert 
And wind up following the wrong gods home 
But the flock cries out for another 
And they keep answering that bell 
And one more starry-eyed messiah 
Meets a violent farewell- 
Learn to be still 
Learn to be still 

Now the flowers in your garden 
They don't smell so sweet 
Maybe you've forgotten 
The heaven lying at your feet 

There are so many contradictions 
In all these messages we send 
(We keep asking) 
How do I get out of here 
Where do I fit in? 
Though the world is torn and shaken 
Even if your heart is breakin' 
It's waiting for you to awaken 
And someday you will-

Learn to be still 

You just keep on runnin'

Eagles,"It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away
And she became the girl from yesterday

He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away
And she became the girl from yesterday

She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long
And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away
Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday

The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory that's never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday",The Girl From Yesterday
Eagles,"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
in the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfold
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hand on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And tak care of your own
One day they're here;
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

But you can never leave!",Hotel California [LP Version]

You can spend all your love making time

Would you still be mine?

There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama,
There must be someone you know.

You might have somethin' to loose.
Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna
Do in those shoes?

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart.
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start.

Desperation in the singles bars
And all those jerk offs in their fancy cars.
You can't believe your reviews.

Oh, no, you can't do that,
Once you started wearin' those shoes

They're lookin' at you, leanin' on you
Tell you anything you want to hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere

Never seem to learn

Peanuts and politics
They think they know it all
They don't know much of nothing

Cover to cover

Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

You’re my love drunk friend
All that red wine and candlelight
And soulful conversations
That go on until the dawn

How many times can you tell your story?
How many hangovers can you endure
Just to get some snuggling done?

You're living in a hollow dream
You don't have the slightest notion
What long term love is all about

All your romantic liaisons
Don't deal with eternal questions like
Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?
Whose turn to take the garbage out?

Frail grasp on the big picture
You keep on rubbin' that, you're gonna get a blister
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
I've seen it all before

And we pray to our Lord
Who we know is American
He reigns from on high
He speaks to us through middlemen

And He shepherds His flock
We sing out and we praise His name
He supports us in war
He presides over football games

And the right will prevail
All our troubles shall be resolved
We have faith in the Lord

Frail grasp on the big picture
Nobody's calling them for roughing up the pitcher
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Heaven help us

Frail grasp on the big picture
All waiting for that miracle elixir
It’s a frail grasp on the big picture
I don't wonder anymore

Frail grasp on the big picture
Somebody says, ""You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her”
It’s a frail grasp on the big picture

Frail grasp on the big picture
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

Frail grasp on the big picture

She bows her head and lifts her hands
Her hips begin to circle slowly
Her eyes have closed; her face is holy
She holds the whole world in trance
I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

She likes the slow songs of love lost
They take her a million miles away
'Cause to dream, sometimes, is the only way
To go places you can't get to any other way
Our eyes connect; she takes my hand
I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
Will it ever satisfy my longing?
I'm gonna hold on to you for as long as I can
For who knows, this dance may be our only dance

So we danced together, close and slow
So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck
Slowly breaking down my will
The room spins so I can barely stand
The song ends; then, she lets go of my hand
There?s so much I don?t understand
But I love to watch a woman dance

As evening falls, the gentle breezes blow
The time we shared went by so fast
Just like a dream, we knew it couldn't last
But I'd do it all again
If I could, somehow
But I must be leavin' soon
It's your world now

It's your world now
My race is run
I'm moving on
Like the setting sun
No sad goodbyes
No tears allowed
You'll be alright
It's your world now

Even when we are apart
You'll always be in my heart
When dark clouds appear in the sky
Remember true love never dies

But first a kiss, one glass of wine
Just one more dance while there's still time
My one last wish: someday, you'll see
How hard I tried and how much you meant to me

It's your world now
Use well the time
Be part of something good
Leave something good behind

I take my bow

Shadows movin' on the sand
Somebody whisperin' the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his tremblin' hands

Somebody tryin' just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

Silent stars blinkin' in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passin' by
Galaxies unfoldin', new world's bein' born
Pilgrims and prodigals creepin' toward the dawn

Smokin' fine cigars and swappin' lives

Give me another piece of that pecan pie""

We're ridin' to utopia, road map says we'll be arrivin' soon
Captains of the old order clingin' to the reins
Assurin' us these aches inside are only growin' pains
But it's a long road out of Eden

Back home, I was so certain the path was very clear
But now I have to wonder what are we doin' here'
I'm not countin' on tomorrow and I can't tell wrong from right

Weavin' down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda

Been down the road to Damascus, the road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way

Of afternoons in the clover fields

Where we once made love
Then wandered home together

Where we made our own weather

Another summer's promise almost gone.
And thought I heard some wise men say that every dog will have his day,
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long.

I don't know when I realized the dream was over.
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day.
You know it didn't go down in flames,
There was no final scene, no frozen frame,
I just watched it slowly fade away.

And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for my time to come around again.
And hope is floating on the breeze,
Carrying my soul high up above the ground.
And I've been keeping to myself,
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing.
Even know you're with somebody else,
He'll never love you like I do.

I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows,
While peacocks prance and strut up on the stage.
If finding love is just a dance, proximity and chance,
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade.

And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for the dust to settle down.
Along the back roads, running through the fields,
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town.
And I imagine sunlight in your hair, you're at the county fair,
You're holding hands and laughing,
And now the Ferris Wheel has stopped,
You're swinging on the top, suspended there with him,
And he's the darling of the chic, playboy of the week,
The flavor of the week is melting down your pretty summer dress, baby what a mess you're making.

I've been stumbling though some dark places,
And I'm following the cloud.
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's all right now.

And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for the summer rain to fall.
Upon the wild birds, scattering the seeds,
Answering the calling of the
Tide's Eternal tune, the phases of the moon,
The chambers of the heart, the egg and dart.
A small gray spider spinning in the dark,
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart.

And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for my time to come around again.
And hope is floating on the breeze,

Around the time I first went on my own 
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of 
And my friends and I were one 
Now the distance is done and the search has begun 
I've come to see where my beginnings have gone 

Oh the walls and the windows were still standing 
And the music could be heard at the door 
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions 
Asked if I came very far 
And when my silence replied they took me inside 
Where their children sat playing on the floor 

Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on 
And it left me so warm and so high 
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun 
I heard that highway whisper and sigh 
Are you ready to fly? 

And I looked into the faces all passing by 
It's an ocean that will never be filled 
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles 
That even love cannot rebuild 
It's a hotel at best, you're here as a guest 
You oughta make yourself at home while you're waiting for the rest 

Well I looked into dream of the millions 
That one day the search will be through 
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions 
Looking into you 

The great song traveler passed through here 
And he opened my eyes to the view 
And I was among those who called him a prophet 
And I asked him what was true 
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone 
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own

And then when we hit Texas 
We'll stop in Amarillo for a bite to eat 
We'll stop on over in Dallas 
And visit my friend but we can't stay 
For more than a week 
I've got the south in my veins 
But California in my mouth 
And that's the simple reason 
Why I'm leaving the south

They always talking a lot of smack
But ain't saying nothing
They steady fronting every time that I confront them
Common they just a bunch of ho's, 
Swinging on the poles
Buying coke, then they sniff it up in they nose

Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

You can tell me,
Now ain't you a friend of mine.

You'd be so nice by the fire

Earl Blake,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Earl Bostic,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Earl Bostic,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

I feel your kiss and then you disappear

A moment of bliss we spent

You and the song are gone

I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Earl Hines,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Earl Hines,"Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Weary totin', it's such a load,
Whike I'm travelin' down, travelin' down that lonesome old road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.",Lonesome Road
Earl Hines,"Don't forget our Monday date
Oh little baby, don't be late
I said don't forget our Monday date
At the same little place, about half past eight

Now I'm gonna press my suit
I'm gonna shine my shoes
I'm gonna spread the news
And I'm gonna chase away the blues
So don't forget our Monday date
Please, baby, don't be late",A Monday Date
Earl Hines,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Earl Hines,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way

Earl Hines,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

Earl Hines,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

My heart grows wings then away it flies

Earl Hines,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings

But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

That comes with each new love affair

From Memphis to St. Joe,

Earl Hines,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Earl Hines,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues [Version 1]

It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Earl Klugh,"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine

Hang it on a tree.
For that's the way to start to make a pretty world, 
For you and for me.

And for the sun we'll take a lemon bright balloon, 
You can hold the string.
Oh, can't you see that little world of ours will be, 
The prettiest thing.

We can gather rain enough for the stream, 
To hold our happy faces.
When you want a breeze, 
I'll blow you a kiss or two.

Take me in your arms and our little world, 
Will be the place of places.
Nothing must be made but breakfast and love.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Earl Klugh,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

As my eyes visualize a family

Not for a year but ever and a day

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

I wanna go and bounce the moon

But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love 

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Why is this song I sing so sad?

Loving the love I love to love to love to love

Over the shadows and the rain

Earl Klugh,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Earl Scruggs,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word

But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no

The coldest winter in almost fourteen years
Could never, never change your mind

And I love ya
Yes indeed and I love ya
And I love ya
Lord I love ya
And I love ya
And I love ya",Mandolin Wind
Earl Scruggs,"Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch",Country Comfort
Earl Scruggs,"Sometimes I feel like an innocent one
To deserve this fate what I have I ever done
I know that I made all the rules
But time can even change the hopeless ways of fools
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I won't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

Who's looking after this see-through heart
Someone up there isn't doing their part
Oh Cupid you foolish boy
You should take better aim with your brand new toy
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I don't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

So if I die before I wake
The innocent one whose heart could never break
Lift me up take me out of this bed
Watching the angels shake their heads
Don't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cry
You can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and by
I'll be riding that train I'll be singing that song
But I won't be gone for long
'Cause the angels won't have it

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind

For all those folks I left behind.

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues,

And I'm back to ramble,
To my Blue Ridge far away.""

I'm goin' to do right by my Ma,

Goin' to see my old oak tree,
Gonna hunt the possum 
Where the corn cob blossom,
In my Blue Ridge far away.

I see a window with light,
I seem to hear them both sigh, 
""Where is my wand'rin boy tonight?""

Earl Scruggs,"At every glance, you steal from me 
I catch your eyes still offering 
Ill-got desire bought with deceit 
'Cause borrowed love ain't never free 

I vainly swear in my starved mind 
To crave your look only one more time 
And pray not to reap what we might sow 
If borrowed love should start to grow 

Borrowed love, not yours for givin' 
Borrowed love, not mine to seek 
Borrowed love, this road we're takin' 
Toward one another's awful steep 

Forgiveness for what passion wreaks 
Bears a hurtful cost that don't come cheap 
Its wages paid with misery 
'Cause borrowed love ain't never free",Borrowed Love
Earl Scruggs,"Mobil station where I stand
This old gas pump in my hand
My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel
Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel
Here comes a big shot from the city

'Fill her up son, unleaded
I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'
Up in the front seat a pretty red head
'We're going to Vegas we're gonna get wed'
'So fill her up son, don't be staring

I'm gonna fill her up and head west

I can sort it out later on the phone
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home
And as I head through the woods on the way back
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven
And there's music playing
This money is cold in my hand
And a voice somewhere is saying
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing
And what real happiness can it bring?'
You're gonna fill her up with sadness
You're gonna fill her up with shame
You're gonna fill her up with sorrow
Before she even takes your name
You're gonna fill her up with madness
You're gonna fill her up with blame
You're gonna live with no tomorrow
You're gonna fill her up with pain
You're gonna fill her up with darkness
You're gonna fill her up with night
You gotta fill her up with Jesus
You gotta fill her up with light
You gotta fill her up with spirit
You gotta fill her up with grace
You gotta fill her up with heaven
You got the rest of life to face
You gotta fill her up the right way
You gotta fill her up with care
You gotta fill her up with babies
You gotta fill her up and swear
You're gonna love that girl forever
You're gonna fill her up for life
You're gonna be a loving husband

Grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album cracking to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm going to blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want I'm taking no advice
Nigga, I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish
And I'm stressing over payment, so don't tell me that I made it
Only relatively famous in the midst of a tornado
Misfitted, I'm Clark Gable, I'm not stable, abrasive as fuck
And they all pay me, I'm chuckling, cross-faded in public
Heart racing 'til blunt is lit like, ""He don't give a fuck again, right?""

""Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga?
I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga
I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through
Or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em""

I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga, night life living
Riding in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's aight nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it
The nicest doin' it, what the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga

Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
North north is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept the sticky in the Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at 2, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big roll dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement, covered trussled drugs, toughen up

Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address me by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type

It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks

Uh time lapse, bars rot in heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex-fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much, you made my life
Harder, and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit""

Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake through the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke",Uncle Al

Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, ate nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Raquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea kettle songs

Yeah, the misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick, thought out
Toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Earl Sweatshirt,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",AM//Radio
Earl Sweatshirt,"Intercepting a fifth of whisky
And neckin it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless
I never hugged a fence
I pick a side and trust in it
Stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other cleanse
Sunday binge, Monday
Then another 6 days back to Sunday when it's done again
And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the street lights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic
But that's just the difference
Nigga my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look I got hoes in my britches
Big up Dill and britches provark em and soon
Thought you knew this my nigga
It's crackin like french tips
Just checkin and balances
And checks and salaries
Testing my friendships
Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me
I threw the rest off the balcony
Shoutout Da$H and Retchy
I know yo bitch check for me
So much for chivalry
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my 20s now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdained from the loss since a fucking child
Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all and we running out
Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya
Tell mom I'mma get a gun
If I get too popular
I'm just being honest with it
Tell her
Stop whining
It ain't no mo problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
I'm just home when you speaking
Ain't no home for the weekend
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there

And I'm low and I'm peakin
It's cold in the deep end

If you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA
Bitch nigga, we the train
If you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA

Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that
I ain't seen us in years
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack
Your momma heart intact
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back
A house on the hill with a big ass grill
We could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me

Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Just trying to see an end and some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal
Staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August
In the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell
And I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith they never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet

And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run, don't chase me

Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
As hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born readily
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I’m a fluid brawler
Rain checkin’ on ya product, never (im)'pressing papa
Out the toaster, I gotta focus on my family problems
Shrunk and widen up with the bumps in my personal filings
It hurt cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
A reverse of the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for tryin’
Still this nigga too busy wildin’

Good grief, I been reaping what I sow
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focus on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, nigga, shit

I'm fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Mama taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar

I'mma wallow when I lie in that

When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back",Grief

Face the same but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home
I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors
Guess he isn’t home
Probably ‘cause that fucking faith I didn’t show
Skippin church, flip the work
Hit a dirt, like Tommy run it bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasn’t in
Came up of of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn’t hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty they ain't dollar top lotto picks
Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end
Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me
Back roll
Garbage bag full of sand
Place myself the rap stale
Cash is in hand
Packs get vac sealed

Really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late
I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave
Now you in the industry ocean
And missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish
Home gets distant
We working I'm on the road again
Cold and his spirits is
Bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits
And the crib mirror mirror
Let me hear why the niggas
That's the peers see and hear us
Then mimmick the fucking motions man
Keep the circle closed
Let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen
The rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker
It help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit
Who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Never trying me, I'm diving
Falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems I don't holler
Rather fix 'em by myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you
This the shit to yell

This the shit right
Keep your chin high up
Cause when she ain't fucking with you
Then her friend might
Let you get up inside yup
Let this shit ride

And they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick

And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst
Cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My abscence, a fuss
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed & we scuffled

Never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me

But lately conversation only comes
When someone's calling on the phone,
Oh, but I'm not asking questions
Afraid that I might find out
What's really wrong
You give me that silent treatment
I can take it or leave
I'm getting that silent treatment
And it's working on me
Oh, but leaving off all the changes
I remember back when our love
It didn't hurt
Like when I'd wake up close beside you,
And you'd just lay there begging me
Stay home from work,
Now you don't like to talk about it
But lately we've been missing

And with all of your heart you're gonna try to keep my honest

Ever drag you apart
From the only girl who could ever
Ease your pain
She would follow your dreams
To the farthest extremes
But she needs more than just someone
To be true to
While it seems you just need someone sane
Who can drive all that noise
From your brain
Well you can roll on forever
Once you're out on your own
Until you finally catch up
To the truth
Then all the signs run together
And boy you're too far from home
To leave Ruby Ann
With the blues

Said the only way to get to him was a telephone
So she held on to me when she couldn't hold her own
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle somewhere between right and wrong
She said you know I never was the kind to spread it around
But I'll let you get to me as long as you don't let me down
Said I got the kind of love it takes to make if feel slow
But don't care how you get me there just long as I go
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle somewhere between right and wrong

For she's got you thinking of something so different tonight
It's too late to worry what's right or what's wrong and you're a little too crazy to leave it alone
When you're looking at something that's too good to push it aside
Boy, she's got your head in the clouds and your heart in a bind
How come you're feeling so proud when your love's on the line?
You still think your first love's the best in your life when you know you should hurry
But you can't say goodbye 
And you know you can't go back and feel like you're where you belong
Now the sweet taste of freedom is hard to control when the touch of a woman's so tender to hold
She won't even let you remember how long you've been gone

Earl Thomas Conley,"In solemn response, to your wishes and wants
I stand with my heart in my hands
Though the courage it takes to live with mistakes
Makes me feel less than a man
Because girl you're the beat that robs me of sleep
By keeping my face in the rain
But how can I rest, when your love's the test
That leaves me with no one to blame
And proves I'm attracted to pain

Unintentional pain
Like a continual rain that's falling
Down on me

So with helpless consent I pay for the rent
On a room where we hide in the dark
From a woman and child whose love is on trial
By a man who once swore on his heart
That only in death would they part

But unintentional pain keeps calling
Like a continual rain that's falling

Be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right

She made my days long before you made my nights

Gee, it's been a long time

But I can't win for losin' you

Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back

And can we be happy, happy alone?

And we go right in, it's there, it's new, it's cool
It's something we ain't seen before

To clip off our carefree flapping wings
Show us the things we can't afford then throw us overboard

Until I see you off at home, down the sidewalk in my head
I might be sinking like a stone, but perfectly happy, just openly happy

And everything is fine
Lock down the doors
And that's what we're paying you for

Open your eyes
Find your faith in Jesus Christ

No matter what they try to do
'Cause you can't pull out the circuits
Remove the bulb or blow the fuse

And it just might be the brightest star
Discovered yet by man
But it might as well be a pin hole
From where we stand

There are times when I thought
It'd be easy to ignore
But it just takes one look
And I don't believe my theory anymore

I won't get upset, I won't fight it
I'd have no escape in mind
But the distant roar of the highway
Just won't subside

So don't leave soon, don't leave this room
We'll be on top of the moon but 'til then
It's a bloodbath, it's a bloodbath
It's a bloodbath and it's getting worse

In a crowded room
There are people planning our time
And the next time I know when I see them
They will be older and we'll be fine

You can count up all of your friends
Who still really know you on just one hand
And the others that come around too
They'll understand

So don't feel bad, don't look so sad
We're much more than that
But for now it's a deathtrap
It's a deathtrap, it's a deathtrap

For every single tear you cried 
I'd probably never miss

Of half living creatures to butcher for organs
Transplants extend another's life span
Re-created, twisted in neo-god's hands

To increase their output for human usage
Left immobile as designed
Trapped in a tortuous unexistence

Horrific cruelty inflicted
Demons in white coats leer down on their prey
Trapped in a hell on earth that's unknown

Trained to deny that they're even alive

Profit estimates drown the cries of pain

Reach up for a hand but they're all bitten

Killing brain cells, pure misery
Killing brain cells, renounce, relapse
Killing brain cells, over and over again, again

As weak promises shatter
Used up all the second chances
Given by the ones who matter

Have all worn thin and through
The escape route transformed
Changed into a death trap

Killing brain cells, pure misery
Killing brain cells, renounce, relapse
Killing brain cells, over and over again, again

Through free will it was chosen
Can't pin it on anyone else
Can't pin it on anyone else

Broke through the thin ice once stood on
Fall down into the nothingness
Die from the venom intaken
Now there's no one else to be blamed

One that likes to dress up and be cool

You gotta love you 
And learn all the beautiful things around you, 
Trees and birds...and if 
There ain't no beauty, 
You got to make some beauty

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
 
Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

All the need to be loved can't be wrong
