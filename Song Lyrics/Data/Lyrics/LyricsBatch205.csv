Johnny Horton,"In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship, they had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship, the Hood
And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

 We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck  cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismarck on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firin' fifteen miles away
""We gotta sink the Bismarck"" was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""put every ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea""

 We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down""

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismarck"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship been makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismarck and prepared to cut her down

We found that German battleship been  makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
We found the mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down",Sink the Bismarck
Johnny Horton,"I mushed from Point Barrow through blizzard of snow.
Been out prospectin' for two years or so.
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a-boom.
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog sea-loon.

As I walked in the door, the music was clear.
The purtiest voice I had heard in two years.
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold.
When its springtime in Alaska it's forty below.
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below.) 

It was Redhead Lil who was singin' so sweet.
I reached down and took the snow packs off my feet.
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune.
We did the eskeemo hop all around the sea-loon.

With a caribou crawl and a grizzly bear hug.
We did our dance on a kodiak rug.
The song she kept singin' made a man's blood run cold.
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below.

I was as innocent as I could be.
I didn't now Lil was Big Ed's wife-to-be.
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw.
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below.
(When it's springtime in Alaska he'll be six feet below.)",When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)
Johnny Horton,"The snowflakes fall as winter comes
And time just seems to fly
Is it the loneliness in me
That makes me want to cry?
My heart is sad, like a mourning dove
That's lost its mate in flight
Hear the cooing of his lonely heart
Through the stillness of the night

Whispering pines, whispering pines
Tell me, is it so?
Whispering pines, whispering pines
You're the one who knows
My darling is gone, oh she's gone
And I need your sympathy
Whispering pines, send my baby back to me

See that squirrel up in the tree
His mate there on the ground
Hear their barking call of love
For the happiness they found
Is my love, still my love?
Oh, this I've go to know
Send a message by the wind
Because I love her so

Whispering pines, whispering pines
Tell me, is it so?
Whispering pines, whispering pines
You're the one who knows
My darling is gone, oh she's gone
And I need your sympathy
Whispering pines, send my baby back to me",Whispering Pines
Johnny Horton,"(Mr Moonlight)
[ guitar ]
Nobody really cares where the moon goes to dawn
Just as long as it's around when the sun goes down then it's nothing wrong
Mr Moon and me and baby makes three we're just like one big family
Everything is right when you're shining bright Mr Moonlight
When the storm clouds gather and you don't know what to do
Pack up your troubles and take a walk underneath the moon
Tell him what's wrong and before too long you'll be hummin' a happy song
Everything is right when you're shining bright Mr Moonlight
 
[ guitar ]
Well I've been gone for a long long time from home
You can bet your money honey when I walk I walk alone
I'm not mixed up with Mr Moon around it's the word that sounds upside down
Everything is right when you're shining bright Mr Moonlight
If you and I Mr Moonlight we make three
And don't forget baby will have all night you him and me
He'll put their moonbeams in your hair I bet John Lovin' he'll take it from there

Johnny Horton,"Well I went out a fishin' to make a little mon.
To take to Cajulina so we could have some fun.
On the way back, I knocked a hole in my bow.
I got a hole in my pirogue, I can't go see my gal.

The purtiest sight that you ever have seen
Is a moonlight night down in New Orleans.
I'm up the river, just around the bend.
I got a hole in my pirogue, I just cain't hold it in.

Well Catelina's waitin' with tears in her eyes.
Munchin' and a crunchin' on a crawfish pie.
I smell a feeling floatin' through the air
I got a hole in my pirogue, I can't go see my Cher.

Yeah I'm here on the bayou, sittin' all alone
With a busted bottom and I cain't pole it home.

Johnny Horton,"If you told me that you loved me I'd feel so proud
If you let me hold you honey I'd holler out loud.

Oh wantcha let me baby just to kind of hang around.
I'll always love ya honey and I'll never let let ya down.
I'll never love another even if I can.
Oh come to me baby, I'm a one-woman man.

Get your face all pretty and your hair done right

I'm a coming home I gotta make some love
I'm a coming home sweet turtle dove
I'm a coming home to make sweet love to you

Johnny Horton,"You fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

Saw you a-marchin' with Robert E. Lee
You held your head a-high, tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost, they speak highly of your name

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they begin to fall
You had tears in your eyes, 'cause you couldn't help at all

But you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

I saw General Lee raise the sabre in his hand
Heard the cannon's roar as you made your last stand 
You marched in the battle with the gray and the red
When the cannon's smoke cleared, took days to count the dead

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song ""Dixie""
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb

Johnny Horton,"Well way down yonder on Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from a wagon seat.
I tune fiddle and I rub my bow.
Play a little tune wherever I go.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

Now Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg.
The wooden leg was nothing but a little wooden peg.
With one shoe off and one shoe on
Do the double-shuffle 'till the cows come home.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

The racoon left and the old hound whined.
John said 'Sick 'em', and the racoon left.

Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

I took my money and I ain't worked since.

Johnny Horton,"Oh, well, I bought me a donkey, about four foot tall
To plough my cotton in the early fall
He's runnin' around, it was an awful sin
I had to build a fence to keep my donkey in

I rigged up a wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at large
Inside this bin I turned him loose
Thrilled by volts of electrified juice

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, the first time he backed up against it
He threw back his ears and he had a fit
He brayed real loud and he hit high gear
He jumped up into the stratosphere

I just got word from Albuquerque
A donkey up there was looking for work
He's my donkey and his name is Jack
Oh, how I wish he'd come on back

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, more word came from Palomar
A man up there was a-watching the star
While looking through his telescope
He nearly had himself a stroke

He saw something riding up the rainbow trail
With two long ears and a puckered up tail
The thing he saw when he 'firmed the states
Was a donkey heading for the pearly gates

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence",The Electrified Donkey

Why didn't I leave you when I saw you kissin' him

You said it didn't mean a thing you even said I was to blame
You said forget let's start anew I make amens and I'll be true

Johnny Horton,"There was a Yankee Cornel in 1862 
Who fell in Love with a southern belle where the sweet magnolias bloom

He offered her a band of gold and his name to share 
She said that she would marry him and even set the day 
But little did he know that she loved a soldier boy in grey.

She took every little thing from Cornel dressed in blue 
She wouldn't let him hold her in a fond embrace

When I pass by all the people say he's just another guy on the lost highway

And now I'm lost too late to pray Lord I've paid the cost on the lost highway

WRITER DAVE BURGESS

Now there's a little place that I know about
I go there with my baby everytime I take her out
We park by the rock and watch the lights down below
And I tell her things that she ought to know
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
I just can't wait for Saturday night
We'll park by the rock in the pale moonlight
I'll grab my baby and steal a kiss and then
I know she'll be stealin' it right back again
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Well, everybody's got a little place they call their own
Where they can always go when they wanna be alone
Lover's rock is the best around
It's a short way up but it's a long way down
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on

Johnny Horton,"High on the mountain tell me what you see
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
Better get your rifle boy before it's too late
Cause the bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed
And some folks say he look a lot like me
[ harmonica ]
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees
Cut down the trees but my honey's all gone
Old Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
[ harmonica ]
Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below
And the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him up the gully then we'll run him in the well
And shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell
He's big around the middle...

Johnny Horton,"In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship, they had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea

And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea

I whittled out a fiddle from my wagon seat.
I fiddled my fiddle and I rubbed my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John, better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
And try to get to heaven 'fore the Devil gets to you.

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose he flopped but he couldn't get loose.
Said John to the goose ""If you don't be still,
We'll miss my supper down in Candyville.""

Well Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg.
The little leg was nothing but a little wooden peg.
One shoe off and one shoe on
He'll do the double shuffle 'til the cows come home.

Now I got twenty dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since.
Sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now.

The raccoon laughed and the old hound whined.
John said ""Sic 'em"" and the raccoon left

There is one who's smiling face the Gods would see
Cause she'll walk along beside me up to golden stairs

And to see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never ever take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in uncaress

But don't be afraid 'cause you've got it made

That's why it hurts so much to lose it

So why don't you use it?

That my love is a sure thing, girl

Johnny Lee,"When the train pulled into the station
He'd open up his case and resin up his bow
Play upside down the orange blossom special
'Cause if you want to make a living you've got to put on a good show

And when he'd smell the smoke and the cinders
He'd slick back his hair, and open up his case
He'd play the Cherokee Fiddle, he'd play it for the whiskey
'Cause good whiskey never let him lose his place

He was always there, playing for the miners
The Devil's Dream was a song they understood
Then he'd go back to Oklahoma
Wait till the trains were running and the weather was good

And when he'd smell the smoke and the cinders
He'd slick back his hair, and open up his case
Play the Cherokee Fiddle, he'd play it for the whiskey
'Cause good whiskey never let him lose his place

Now the Indians are dressing up like cowboys
And the cowboys are putting leather and turquoise on
And the music is sold by lawyers
And the fools who fiddled in the middle of the stations are gone

Some folks say they'll never miss it
Old fiddle squealed like the Indian race
Cherokee Fiddle is gone forever
Like the music of the whistle that the old locomotives made

So when you smell the smoke and the cinders
Just slick back your hair, and open up your case
Play the Cherokee Fiddle, you can play it for the whiskey
'Cause good whiskey will never let you lose your place
No good whiskey will never let you lose your place
No good whiskey will never let you lose your place

Johnny Long,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Jeannine, I Dream of Lilac Time/Ramona"
Johnny Maestro,"Blessed is the rain that falls on me
As far as that girl can see
The earth that I walk upon is heavenly
Blessed is the love I bring to her

And knowing what it means to her
In the eyes of that girl
I am everything to her
But what happens

When the statue on the pedestal
Comes crumbling to the ground
I don't want to be around
To see the sorrow on her face

When she thinks I let her down
And what happens
When she finds the world is real
And not the fairyland she thinks it is

That I'm a man who lives and breathes
And makes mistakes and not a
Superman she dreamed
Blessed is the strength she finds in me

And the weakness she'll never see
I'll go before the image falls apart
And blessed is the way I'll always
Stay in her heart

Oh, blessed is the way I'll always
Stay in her heart",Blessed Is the Rain
Johnny Maestro,"The hours before the morning
Walking home I pass her door
I send a special prayer
Up to the room on the second floor
For my mind is in there with her
But my body takes me home
And I need to have a love
Because I've been too long alone
So won't you
Welcome me love
My name is lonely
Tell that girl that I think of her only
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eye
Welcome me love
I know you don't know me
Take my hand there's a lot you can show me
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eye
I'll try to make her happy
And I promise I'll be good
I'll play it by the rules
Just like every lover should
Times that I will fail her
And we let each other down
But I'm sure that we can make it
As long as you're around
So won't you

Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Can I get the world right here?

Step out to symphonies 
They play on for you and me
When we faced that July down
In uniforms
One and one, no wrong
We chased that summer down

I'm in something alright I know
I got to live it out uh-oh
I can't resist

It turned out like I said it would
Can I get the world right here?

Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Johnny Marvin,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go

Johnny Mathis,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,

How do you make it last?
How do you keep a song from fading too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say?

And since we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart

That in her eyes, I may not see forever, forever

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

So I told the friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills,
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent
Home by the radio

Some like to just reminisce

Just give me one like this

Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

That we walked among
Lying in the hay, games we used to play
Wild around the sun only yesterday

The life of the year, the night of them all
For all of the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke

I walk in a room, a party or ball
There's laughter and lights and wine for us all
And beautiful girls all put to [Incomprehensible]
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees, silent memories

Its good to live it again",Autumn in New York
Johnny Mathis,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Johnny Mathis,"The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing ev'ry song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to prey

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music [From The Sound of Music]

Learning to enjoy at my leisure all the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
That this is all I ask, this is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than Spring",This Is All I Ask

You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'

I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day

Just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

You know what the trouble is, the trouble is that probably
All the good things in life take place in no more than a minute
I mean all I did, I, I bet you
At the end of seventy years, should you live so long
You can sit and you can figure the whole thing out

You spent nineteen years sleeping, you spent 5 years going to the bathroom
You spent thirty five years doing some kind of work you absolutely hated
You spent 7,853 minutes blinking your eyes
And added to that you got that one minute of good things
Then one day you wonder whether your minute's up

And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road

You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

All of your clothes and things were gone.
There wasn't a trace of you.
How could you go and leave so completely?
Nothing was left of all the memories that we used to share
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half-filled cup of coffee:
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair.
At least you could have said goodbye you
Shouldn't have run away!
Were you afraid that I would cry?
My tears might have made you stay.
Where are those dreams that kept us together?

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
When we finally say good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
But as long as you love me so.

How can you stop the sun from shining?

How can a loser ever win?

And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets spurned in a three way script
Ends up number two
The movie queen to play the scene
A bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real

That I just don't get it

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And let it be like they said it would be 
Me loving you girl, and you loving me.
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older,
So darling, you run to me.

And when you're out in the cold,
No one beside you, and no one to hold,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And when you've got nothing to lose,
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me

Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older,
So darling, you run to me.",Run To Me

Were hand that I could hold
I'd keep them warm.

And in my hand
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand
We'd choose
The moments that should last.

Timeless moments
That have no future
And no past.

The summer
From the top of a swing
The comfort
In the sound of a laughter.

The innocence
Of leaves in spring
But most of all
The moment when love touched me.

All the happy days
We've never learned to fly
Until the hands of time
Would choose the wave goodbye.",Brian's Song (The Hands of Time)

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And I think that's what I'll do

Johnny Mathis,"Sitting in a railway station
With my suitcase in my hand
Going back where I came from
I've had more than I can stand
Of watching them destroy my dreams
They picked my brain till it was clean
When I was up they knocked me down
I ain't going to hand around, I'm going home

I'm going home, going home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself,
Though I tried to play their game
But using people just ain't my thing
And won't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm going home

High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die

The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is
In the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairy tale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain

How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time the lovely long ago 
we didn't have a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years 
I miss the Hungry Years ?

Johnny Mathis,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Johnny Mathis,"I've been alive forever,
And I wrote the very first song.
I put the words and the melodies together,
I am music,
And I write the songs.

I write the songs that make the whole world sing.
I write the songs of love and special thing s.
I write the songs that make the young girls cry.
I write the songs, I write the songs.

And I've got my own place in your sole.
Now, when I look out through your eyes,
I'm young again, even though I'm very old.

Oh my music makes you dance
And gives your spirit to take a chance,
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move.

Well, that's a real fine place to start.
It's from me it's for you,
It's from you, it's from me,
It's a world wide symphony.

Johnny Mathis,"Isn't it rich, are we a pair
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss, don't you approve
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

My fault I fear,
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry my dear!
But where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns

Who could foresee?
I'd come to feel about you
What you felt about me?
Why only now when I see

Johnny Mathis,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting,
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon somehow
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born",When a Child Is Born
Johnny Mathis,"I was born in San Fransisco when the bay was full of cruisers
Where the west wind smells of fishing boats for fifty miles around
My father wore a crew cut, he was lean and he was handsome
And my mother wore a sash of yellow roses on her gown

They would walk me down from Green Street
Pass cathedrals on the hill sides
And the carillons could fill the hearts of any one in town
I remember how they looked then, when their eyes were always living
When my father loved a girl with yellow roses on her gown

Then we moved to Placid County where the weather was a joker
And I watched my parents laughter turn from amber into ice
But my father never stumbled, he would tell me things would change soon
He would bear and bear the insults of a pair of loaded dice

And my mother stood beside him though her heart was on the hill side
Of a city where a soldier and his lover better die
And at night amid the whisper of the pines and [Incomprehensible]
She would cry into the sash of yellow roses on her gown

Now my father's living eastward by the Sacramento river
And he swears to me he's happy with his practice and some land
In the springtime and the summer when the fog is off the valley
I visit him on weekends, his grass is overgrown

Sometimes after dinner, I will gaze away the evening
In the attic at a sash of yellow roses on her gown",Yellow Roses on Her Gown

Love fresh as the morning air

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow

Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love

Time wont change the meaning of one love

This is more than just a simple hello.
Hello, do I smile and look away? No, I think I'll smile and stay
To see where this might go.

Cause the last time I felt like this, I was falling in love,
Falling and feeling, I'd never fall in love again.
Yes, the last time I felt like this, was long before I knew
What I'm feeling now with you.

Hello, I can't wait till we're alone, somewhere quiet on our own
So that we can fall the rest of the way.
I know that before the night is thru, I'll be talking love to you,
Meaning every word I say.

Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like fourth dimension
Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's theory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die

Very slowly picking me apart

And how they change with the times
And lately, all I've been seein' are people
Throwin' love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
'Cause I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurtin' each other
When love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?

I've been listenin' to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe

I see love hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even tryin' to keep it alive

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?

Like some violins are playin'

Hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair
She's lost her smile
Changed her style

And pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through

The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night,
O night divine!

Led by the light of Faith
Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!

Oh praise His name forever,
His pow'are and glory evermore proclaim

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Johnny Mathis,"Like the sweet morning dew, 
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.
 
Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best, 
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination.
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more.

Johnny Mathis,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep a song from fading too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say?

And since we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

I know the way you feel for her, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in her eyes, I may not see forever, forever

If you can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better
As it grows, with any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends

Johnny Mathis,"So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting
The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
I wouldn't change a thing that happened
On my way to you",On My Way to You
Johnny Mathis,"I guess I wanted something new in my life
A new key to fit a new door
To wake and see a different view in my life
What I've been waiting for

Dreams like everyone I had a few in my life
Who knew that this one would come true in my life
I knew the moment when you touched me
You touched me

You're like a sudden breeze that blew in my life
A new face, a new smile, a new song
And now I know I wanted you in my life all along

You're like a chance I had to take in my life
I found you and couldn't lose you
And all the difference that you make in my life
The feelings I never knew

I guess I must have saved an empty place in my heart
For you to come and fill the space in my heart
That long before I said, I loved you
I loved you

Whatever happens this is true in my life
When all the springs have come and gone
Whatever doors I may go through in my life
Whatever else that I may do in my life

From now on
I know there always will be you in my life

Johnny Mathis,"Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses morning me, evening me
And as the world slips far away, star away
Forever me with love

Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence quietly whisper me
Forever me with love, forever me with love

And every day I'll gentle you, tender you
And oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine

Suddenly, magically we found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you happy me
Summer me, winter me, always be mine

Suddenly, magically we found each other

Johnny Mathis,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind

Johnny Mathis,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?

Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

Johnny Mathis,"I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'

Johnny Mathis,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens

What chance would I have, why let the fire start?

I'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me

It could happen to you
Don't count stars or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble

It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be

Endless rain into a paper cup

Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Johnny Mathis,"When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

And in the silence of a mist, of a morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise of happiness?

Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and precious memory
Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and me
This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share

The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving can give the heart
When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night

Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love
Together, so much in love
So tell me

You kiss me, and with your kiss the world begins

And we breathe in the cool salty air

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you and you melt in my arms
There we are, darling, only you and I
What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is full of wondrous things it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own
And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

And I say to myself

Johnny Mathis,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [Live]
Johnny Mathis,"A certain smile, a certain face
Can lead an unsuspecting heart on a merry chase
A fleeting glance can say so many lovely things
Suddenly you know why my heart sings

You love awhile and when love goes
You try to hide the tears inside with a cheerful pose
But in the hush of night exactly like a bittersweet refrain
Comes that certain smile to haunt your heart again


But in the hush of night exactly like a bittersweet refrain
Comes that certain smile to haunt your heart again",A Certain Smile [Live]

The moment you come into view,
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you.
Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine,
Chances are you think my heart's your Valentine.

In the magic of moonlight,
When I sigh, ""Hold me close, dear,""
Chances are you believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes.

Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And, if you think you could,
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good.

Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan 

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again 

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning 

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning 

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear,
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
Would I wander through this wonderland alone

My hat from my glove,
I get misty, and too much in love.

And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn,

Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times

I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

And not feel you going through me?
Split a second without never think of you
Are all impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you couldn't I ever want for more?
It's just impossible

And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'll get it
I will sell my very soul and not regret
'Cause to live without your love it's just impossible

Impossible, impossible, impossible

Johnny Mathis,"You are like the sun that starts my day
Everything is easier to see when you are around
Hearing the sound of your voice, I just have to stop and smile
Even if this hurried world should turn it's back on me

Who needs the world when you here with me
No one in the world, no one in my life could take your place
Everyday there's someone in the world
Making even hard times easy like no one in the world

In the night comes in the heart of love the dark
Listening to the sweet eternal music of your heart
I wish we had more than one life
I'd spend them all with you

Everyday I'd find another reason to be the last
I have the chance to be here with you
No one in the world, no one in my life could take your place
Everyday there's someone in the world
Making even hard times easy like no one in the world

So stay with me
Everything the world can give
We're gonna find together

Like no one in the world can do
Just as long as I have you
Nothing can ever stop me

Stay right here
Everything that's fine and that's clear
Started the day I met you

Like no one in the world you are
Like a very lovely star

Johnny Mathis,"It's our past that holds us captive
That made us who we are
That blinds us when we have to see
Beyond every scar

It is you who wants to hold me
Until the end of time
Hold me so hard I cannot breathe
But our words don't rhyme

Your love just makes me colder
Although I want to feel
The fire that I gave to you
Hoping it would heal

The bleeding wound deep in me
The emptiness inside
To unveil the buried love
That I try to hide
That I try to hide

Sometimes love is not enough
Sometimes love is not enough

We are still so different
Love doesn't conquer all
If we want to fly together
We are damned to fall

Sometimes love is not enough

Johnny Mathis,"So are we over now?
Do we just turn the page and let the story end?
Do we just walk away?
Just like we never meant

I know we said some things
And now you want to leave
But baby that's no reason
To let a good love die

Why goodbye?
Why must it be this way?
So many words, so many other words
That we could say

Why goodbye
After all this time?
Can't we try?
Why goodbye?

Why can't we work it out?
Why can't we talk it out a little more this time?
Search though the rain and find
A ray of hope still shines

We can't just close the door
We're still worth fighting for
We've come too far together
To leave it all behind

Why goodbye?
Why must it be this way?
So many words, so many other words
That we could say

Why goodbye
After all this time?
Can't we try?
Why goodbye?

The road of love is never easy
You'll get lost along the way
But in time you can find your way through

We can make it through the bad times
We can make it to the good times
Through the stormy weather 'cause we belong together

Why goodbye?
Why must it be this way?
So many words, so many other words
That we could say

Why goodbye
After all this time?
Can't we try?

We're still worth fighting for
We've come too far together
To leave it all behind
Why goodbye?
Why goodbye?

Johnny Mathis,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

So if I want to show you all you're worth, 
I'd have to try shopping up in the sky. 

I'll buy you a star, 
Not just a star but the best one in the sky. 
You'll have a cloud to sleep on, 
A cloud as light as an angel's sigh.

But I won't rest until I buy the moon.

Johnny Mathis,"Ring the bell, it's a glorious sound, people gather around
And start to cheer and the cheer start to swell
If you like to taking a bow then you got to know how
To ring the bell

Dreams that dwell in the back of your eyes
They'll materialize if you get up and get out of your shell
You can't depend upon bait for your height and your weight
To ring the bell

There's a grindstone for your nose
There's a treetop for your toes
Don't stay home and decompose
Just get out and get going where a go getter goes

Who can tell if you missed a few meals?
If you're down at the heels put on a well to do smile
And you'll do well
Don't hide your head in a truck just come up, all up
And ring the bell

And it's like I always say
Don't do anything halfway
There's a time for work and play
Don't put off tomorrow what you could do today

Ring the bell [Incomprehensible]
Why it's simply absurd how much a wide awake crook can compel
When it's the time to get up, that's the time to get up
When it's the time to get up, that's the time to get up
And ring, and ring, and ring the bell

",Ring the Bell

Come shining through

Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Just because they know a thing or two.

They wear those flashy ties and collars,

Others have girls on that old tenderloin,

From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,

They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.

And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,

Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

And flash a Missouri bankroll.

Sometime out on your own now to find your way back home

As touching’ you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you

We’ll be together
It won’t be long, it won’t be long
But it feels like forever
And it’s hard to be strong

Baby, ’cause I’m missing you now
And it’s drivin’ me crazy
How I’m needin’ you, baby

I’m missing you now
Can’t wait till I’m alone with you
To show you how I’m missing you now

Wishin’ you were here by my side
Is all that I can do
My arms around my pillow at night
They should be holdin’ you

I thought I was stronger
How could I know, how could I know
I can’t take this much longer
It’s so hard on my soul

Baby, ’cause I’m missing you now
And it’s drivin’ me crazy
How I’m needin’ you, baby

I’m missing you now
Can’t wait till I’m alone with you
To show you how I’m missing you now

Baby, I just can’t wait till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you’re close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then, will I be satisfied

We’ll be together
It won’t be long, it won’t be long

Johnny Mathis,"Many men with lofty aims strive for lofty goals.
Others play at smaller games, being simpler souls.
I am of the latter brand. All I want to do
Is to find a spot of land and live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home
On a hilltop high, you and I,
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called
""The folks who live on the hill.""

Someday we may be adding
A thing or two, a wing or two.
We will make changes as any family will.
But we will always be called
""The folks who live on the hill.""

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.

Where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured someday soon
We kissed and clung together
Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return I will to old

Brazil the Brazil that I knew
where I wandered with you
Lives in my imagination
Where the songs are passionate
And a smile has flash in it
And a kiss has art in it
For you put your heart in it
And so I dream of old Brazil

Where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured someday soon
We kissed and clung together

Johnny Mathis,"Oh why do the leaves of the mulberry
Tree whisper differently now
And why is the nightingale singing
At noon on the mulberry bough
For some most mysterious reason
This isn't garden I know
No, it's paradise now
That was only a garden a moment ago

Take my hand I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland a stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed that's the danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside an angel like you

I saw your face and I ascended
Out of the commonplace into the rare
Somewhere in space I hang suspended
Until I know there's a chance that you care

Won't you answer this fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair from all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms to this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be a stranger no more",Stranger in Paradise

When chains are torn by courage born
of a love that's free
A time when dreams so long denied can flourish
As we unveil the love we now must hide

A time for us, at last to see
A life worthwhile for you and me
And with our love, through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm

A time for us, some day there'll be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me
For you and me

And with our love, through tears and thorns

Then say you love me every winter morning

Say you need me with you, now and always
Promise me that all you say is true

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light

Your fears are far behind you

All we need is freedom
A world that's warm and bright
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
That's all I ask of you

Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning
Say you feel the way I do

With distengue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...

To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.


Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.


Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.


I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you make me feel brand new

Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that's sometimes back

Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

And you make me feel brand new

That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

The part

Cause when our friends begin that
Heartless rumor
I know I'll really need my
Sense of humor

I'm gonna laugh you right out of my life
Make it a beautiful joke
No one will know you broke

Really meant that last goodbye
Then I'm gonna laugh so hard

Johnny Mathis,"I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon

Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air

It's wonderful, so they say

And, with a moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way
So they say",They Say It's Wonderful [From Annie Get Your Gun]
Johnny Mathis,"Many men with lofty aims strive for lofty goals.
Others play at smaller games, being simpler souls.
I am of the latter brand. All I want to do
Is to find a spot of land and live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home
On a hilltop high, you and I,
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called
""The folks who live on the hill.""

Someday we may be adding
A thing or two, a wing or two.
We will make changes as any family will.
But we will always be called
""The folks who live on the hill.""

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.

Johnny Mathis,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

To tell the story of how great a love can be?
The sweet love story that is older than the sea.
The simple truth about the love she brings to me.
Where do I start?

With her first hello!
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine.
There'd never be another love, another time.
She came into my life and made the living fine.
She fills my heart 

She fills my heart with very special things,
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings.
She fills my soul with so much love,
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely.
With her along, who could be lonely?
I reach for her hand, it's always there 

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?

I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have
Some fun down before I melt away""

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

Of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet, not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my mem'ries are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own like yours

A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again, I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone ya'
I'll never fall in love again yeah, I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what it's all about
Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You get enough tears to fill an ocean

Never fall in love again, again, again, again

Johnny Mathis,"Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare
Then your lips cling to mine
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you and you melt in my arms
There we are, darling, only you and I
What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is full of wondrous things it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own
And I say to myself
""It's wonderful, wonderful""
""Oh, so wonderful, my love""

And I say to myself
""It's wonderful, wonderful""
""Oh, so wonderful, my love""",Wonderful Wonderful
Johnny Mathis,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Johnny Mathis,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start
With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart with very special things
With angels songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-its always there
How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there
How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day

And she'll be there",(Where Do I Begin) Love Story [From Love Story]

And the beauty of it all
When the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you some time
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted waters's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building big castles in the sky

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

And that fantasies somehow come true
When dreaming of you
I've seen a moment's magic shine
Upon the darkest night
And fill it with light

Of love meant to be
I've searched the heavens for you
I've searched heaven and earth
Chasing my dreams on the wings
Of everlasting love
I've searched through heaven and earth
Voicing the song my heart sings
Heaven help us find our love...love
I've wished on a thousand stars
Just for a sparkle to shine through
And lead me to you
Then you appeared as if by magic
Shined your love right into my life
Made everyday bright

It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be,
Here is what Christmas time means to me.

City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style.
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas.

Children laughing, people passing,
Meeting smile after smile,
And on every street corner you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.

City street lights,
Even stop lights,
Blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures.

See the kids bunch,
This is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you'll hear:

And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples
Johnny Mathis,"Once upon a time, there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours,
Think of all the great things we would do

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we'd choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way

Di di di di di di
Di di di di di di
Di di di di di di di di di di

Then, the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If, by chance, I'd see you in the tavern,
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we'd choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days

Just tonight, I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass, I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we'd choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days

Di di di di di di

Through the door, there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we'd choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days",Those Were the Days
Johnny Mathis,"Today I saw you on the street
How sad it was for us to meet
For in that moment of 'hello'
I found the world that I let go
After all the years apart
How strange to find you in my heart
How sad to find that I still love you so
We spoke of all the happy days
Before we went our separate ways
Seeing you I knew the past
Had caught up with my heart at last
I was young and full of spring
Until I saw your wedding ring
It told me of the world I threw away

As we whispered our goodbyes
I held my tears behind my eyes
You kissed my cheek for old time's sake
And I could feel my poor heart break
It was a crazy thing to do
But when you left I followed you
I had to see the world I threw away
I saw the streets I left behind
I saw my yesterdays unwind
And in the park and in the square
The past was waiting everywhere
With each",The World I Threw Away
Johnny Mathis,"Yesterday when I was young,
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas,
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue,
And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday
When I was Young

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all",Yesterday When I Was Young
Johnny Mathis,"Well I'm drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.

Well I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me.

If my baby would only take me back again
If my baby would only take me back again.
Well you know I ain't good for nothin' baby

Well I haven't got no friends.

Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands through his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking
But he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care

If they have met they might have found a world of joy
But she lived on the morning side of the mountain
And he lived and the twilight side of the hill.

They never met they never kissed
And they have never known what happiness they missed
For she lives on the morning side of the mountain
And he lives and the twilight side of the hill.

For love's a rose that never grows
Without a kiss of a morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jude
To know the thrill of a dream that comes true.

This is more than just a simple hello.
Hello, do I smile and look away? No, I think I'll smile and stay
To see where this might go.

Falling and feeling, I'd never fall in love again.
Yes, the last time I felt like this, was long before I knew
What I'm feeling now with you.

Hello, I can't wait till we're alone, somewhere quiet on our own
So that we can fall the rest of the way.

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

My love, to tell you how I feel
My love, mere words could not explain

Precious love, you held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you, you make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you make me feel brand new

My love, whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend, with you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that's sometimes back

Without you, my life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

God bless you , you make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new

That I never had a girl to love.
Many a fine girl I tried hard to know,
But I think I never tried enough.

Sitting one day by myself,
And I'm thinking, ""What could be wrong?""
When this funny little Hedgehog comes running up to me,
And it starts up to sing me this song.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

Every day when the sun go down,
And the evening is so very still,
Many a fine girl I've held in my arms,
And I hope there's many more that I will,
But just when everything is going fine,
And absolutely nothing is wrong,
This funny little Hedgehog's always around
And every time he wants to sing me this song.

But you never quite learned the song, she sang.

Found myself a pretty little girl,

Running down the aisle,
And I don't have to tell you what he did sing.

On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental

Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

She's got a nervish, throwin' him a curvish

Johnny Mercer,"Hooray for Hollywood
That screwy ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic can be a panic
With just a good looking pan
And any barmaid can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan

Hooray for Hollywood,
Where you're terrific if you're even good
Where anyone at all from Shirley Temple to Aimee Semple
Is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck
Hooray for Hollywood

Hooray for Hollywood
That phoney super-Coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Paducas with their bazookas
To get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbon and legs in tights

Hooray for Hollywood
You may be homely in your neighbourhood
But if you think that you can be an actor, see Mr. Factor
He'll make a monkey look good
Within a half an hour you'll look like Tyrone Power

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I adore this ?

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips

""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out

So she stops and always just in time

And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest

I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you

I was curious as could be
To explain what to do, let him tell it to you
Just the way it was told to me

First you write a little ol' tune, real easy
Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy
Real simple chords in the key of see
A melody you can groove

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, ""My have you got a hit""
You act non committal and say, ?Just a little ol' tune""

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it
Dub in some top tenor harmony
Just me, me, me, as you groove

Yes, next you sing a baritone part from way back
Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback
And when they say, ""Ma, he's singing forte""

Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.
Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""

And down the field, pell mell.

Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""

Now that's the way my folks would always sing to me
When I was just a blossom on my family tree
But when I got around to datin' my first chick
This is what she said, an' did she spread it thick

Hey! You're ugly, oh! so ugly
You're some ugly chile
The clothes you wear are not in style
You look like an ape every time you smile
How I hate you, you alligator bait, you
Why don't you lay down and die
How I hate you, you alligator bait, you
An' here's the reason why

You're knock kneed, pigeon toed, box ankled
You're big foot, barefoot slue footed too
How'd they ever get a pair of shoes on you
Your short and squatty, just nobody

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

Johnny Otis,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow

Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
but don't say goodbye

To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be

To the blood red rose

And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Johnny Otis,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?

And just as soon as I see your smiling face 
I'll rush into your warm embrace.

It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just mid summer madness
A passing glow, a moment's gladness
Yes it's love, I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always

",This Is Always
Johnny Pace,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales

Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompañada
Por eso a veces se que necesito

Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas

Johnny Pacheco,"Te escribo esta carta Julia
Para que sepas de mi
Y sepas como me encuentro
Solo por tenerte a ti.
Al escribirte recuerdo
Las palabras de mama,
Pero como la queria,
Nunca la quise escuchar.

Que no confiara en ti
Que tu amor no era sincero
Y por ti mi pobre vieja
Se murio de sufrimiento
No eras nadie al conocerte
Te di nombre y apellido
Belleza que no tenia
Me sacrifique por ti
Porque por ti estaba ciego
Y mira como me pagas
Juliana que mala eres

Coro: Juliana que mala eres,
Que mala eres Juliana (4x)
Ahora comprendo que fui
Un hijo desobediente
Que mama tenia razon,
Pero yo era inocente
A los diecisiete años
Cuando una pasion te ciega
Aunque hoy me pase a mi
Esto le pasa a cualquiera
Creo que no soy el primero
Que una mujer engaño
Tu fuiste pa' Nueva York
Con tu visa de paseo
Pero pasaron los dias,
Semanas, meses y años
Y yo aqui en Santo Domingo
Quede, tu amor esperando
Hasta ayer que me contaron
Que con otro te has casado
Juliana, ehhh...

Coro:
Fragancia:
Tu eres mala
Despues que te di
Todo lo que deseabas
Me sacrifique por ti

No quiero mas nada
No quiero saber mas de ti,

Johnny Pate,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Johnny Pate,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Wanna laugh like a loon

And this I bet you
Some people lose and some folks win
It's a matter of what they do

Are you man enough?
Big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot your down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend
Just around the bin
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough
when the going's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

There's not pretending it goes away
With every step that you take you pay your dues
And I ain't lying
You got to struggle to see the light
Cause someone's looking to steal your right to choose
And they don't stop trying
It's like a jungle outside the door
And it's keeping you so confused

[Chorus]

Gotta keep your eye on the passersby
Better watch your step!
Cause you never know when the knife will go
And they ain't missed yet
The strong survive
They stay alive
They're always cool
But that they never teach you in school

[Chorus: Repeat x2]",Are You Man Enough

Women said they loved me my  how they talked on
Tellin' me lies
And fillin' my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold of myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin' to pull the wool over my eyes
I found you then the skies turned blue
I'm livin' in a house of love
Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit
I couldn't find love the blues were a habit
A lonely man and I couldn't understand
Why everything I tried went wrong

I can see me anytime I want to in my favorite chair at home
I played like a horse when the children needed one to ride on
With each memory I drink it makes me feel so good and warm within
I just think about you and I'm high on the thought of you again
I'm high on the thought just knowing that one time you belonged to me
And we lived in the world that was honest till he came between you and me
So I'll keep drinkin' memories cause the past is for I live in

Splendor Lord you got it wall to wall
And yet with all of that you're still not happy

You know where to find my door

Johnny Paycheck,"I've finally found a place where I can take it
all this loneliness you've left behind
On a mountain that's no hill for a climber
Just one step up, sit back and pour the wine

I climb up on barstool mountain
High above your world where there's no pain
And I'm the king of barstool mountain
Pretending I don't love you once again

At closing time I step down off the mountain
I'm strong enough to make it without you
I know that I'll be right back here tomorrow

Too weak to sober up and face the truth

I climb up on barstool mountain
High above your world where there's no pain
And I'm the king of barstool mountain
Pretending I don't love you once again

Johnny Paycheck,"She loved me more than life its self
But the liquid diet I was on starved our love to death
So it's not hard to figure out why my baby's gone
'Cause when I had a home to go to I never did go home

That house was quite a show place
Ten rooms, two maids, two cars
So now that I've got no place, I sure walk them bars
So pour another double while I tell you what went wrong
When I had a home to go to I never did go home

But wait I see her standing at the door
And those big soft eyes are saying we can try once more
So forget the double, keep the change, you can call me gone
'Cause while I have a home to go to this time I'm going home

Johnny Paycheck,"Here it comes, gonna rub on it

I drank fifteen beers
That's a whole lot of brew in one night
When you're tryin' to drown the memory from your mind
It took me fifteen beers to get here
I don't know how many more till I leave
Take my change in tears and drink fifteen beers

Well I rolled into Joe's about six-fifteen
And I was ready to pour 'em down
Because at eight o'clock Delilah was a-meeting me there
Well I thought I would have three or four just to loosen up
'Cause we were really gonna swing tonight
I could already see her face and touch her long red hair

Well at nine thirty-five I thought man a live
What could be a-holding her up
Just then a man in a long black Cadillac
Came in and told little Joe filler up
While he was cleaning off the windows a-kissing he saw
In the back and it was soft as rain
It was Delilah sipping on pink champagne

I drank fifteen beers
That's a whole lot of blues for one man
When you try to drown the memory from your mind, yeah
It took me fifteen beers to forget you
I don't know how many more to just feel
While he holds Delilah near I'll drink fifteen beers
Bring it on

I drank fifteen beers
And that's a whole lot of brew in one night

I'll take my change in tears and drink my fifteen beers

My fifteen beers how many of you, six or seven?
Fifteen beers, just keep bringing them son
Fifteen beers, that's what I need
Bring me that fifteen beers, and by the way",Fifteen Beers
Johnny Paycheck,"I'm going off of the deep end 
And I'm slowly losing my mind
And I disagree with the way (ha-ha) I'm living
But I can't hold myself in line

You give me no reason for my drinkin' 
But I can't stand myself at times
And you're better off to just leave and forget me 
Cause I can't hold myself in line

Hey, my weakness is stronger than I am
Guess I've always been the losin' kind
Now I'm full speed ahead down the wrong road of life
And I can't hold myself in line

Johnny Paycheck,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square 

Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said, ""Excuse me, Sir 
But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard and long hair"" 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that curb, an I thought to myself 
That's the house of the Lord, that guy's got the hell of a nerve 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees 

I said, ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind 
I just wanted to be with your people, Lord, it's been a long time"" 
A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears 
And I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years 

Then there's those fine cars parked outside, too many for me to count 
Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount 
Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it 
Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show 
Drinkin' beer, screamin, ""Sing 'Shove It'"" 

You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place 
With his coat made of camel hair an' sandals on his feet and a long beard on his face 
You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, and take 'em beyond the clouds 
To live forever in Heaven with you, well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd 

You know, Lord, I'm not perfect, some even call me no count 
But I'll tell you, I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, and not his bank account 
So if this is what religion is, a big car, a suit and a tie 

Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify 
Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
With sandals and a beard, believe you had long hair too 
Well, this is Paycheck, signing off 

I'll be seein' you Lord 
I hope""",The Outlaw's Prayer
Johnny Paycheck,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Johnny Paycheck,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
