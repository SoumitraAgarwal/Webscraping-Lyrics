Kalmah,"Water in eternal movement
Circling day after day
Above the surface in wind's face
Is the end cruelly grimaced
On the water, water lily's leaf
Is rolling on the stream
Beside the bluff there she dances
Water flea in her wedding
Master wind blows waves begin to rise

Her fiance tomorrow child
Just taken his first breath
Take his step and with his bride
They fall into ecstasy
Wind blows hard they do not see
Water lily's leaf is turning
With this move it falls down
Those lovers almost together
Lose their lifes for the others to live
Today it is calm
Tomorrow it storms
But still water
For ever flows",Dance of the Water
Kalmah,"The time is right you and I
We will fight the final battle
Gone away the bond of passion
Death of faith, left aggression

We sworn the oath, now it is broken
Gone away with deception
I'll root out the nest of rebellion
Wage of sin, total subjection

The ancient law from the old union, obedience!

In the face of judge you regret
Sue for mercy before the creating
Remove the one for me to end
Only way to endless purity

Now you find the path of rightness
Opens the gate to deepest openness
True peace in the place of paradise
Will decay

Whiplash, flowing tears
Resumed respect
Supreme power
Beats the evil out of you",Evil in You
Kalmah,"Holding the candle in my arms
I'm kneeling down to the altar
Waiting the call from my master
Soon will weight my soul

In the final scale I see my remains
Red dying flower the pan falls down
I see Anubis, ancient judge of fathers
Won't take my rose falling away

Into Hades I have atomed
Now I'm waiting
Waiting the call
Chance to reborn

Crawling on the ground darkness 
around searching for the light 
That guides me home
Into my cosmic face never shines 
the day cannot reach out prisoner 
Of gods in Hades

Turn into blood rage of sin
Turn into blood, this is Hades",Hades
Kalmah,"Land of mighty and glory
Reality behind the iron curtain

Waves of the bloody revolution
Demagog calling to join them
Puppets will gather
Controlled by the hind brain

Heritance of Berija
Comissar's iron fist

Blood is thicker than water
Innocent people pay the price

Chauvinist using the ultimate power
Democracy demigod of backward nation
The one who sow dissension
Submission or punishment

Salute the one",Heritance of Berija
Kalmah,"Life, testament of fathers
Forces to fight against the dark side
Mystery, still unsolved
Controller of the panel inner body

Hear the voices from the side of unknown
Leading body into temptation
False prophets message behind the mask
Breaking through the will, darker one to rule

Withering away
Only way to be awake
Dispensation into the light
Against the law, internal fight

Two minds destroying their cradle
Suicidal action towards the end

Believer, the feeble natured
Completely influenced by abuser
Awareness, disturbed
A matter of social needs

Suppression way to inner revolution
Denial is the force
Opens the lock of inner control
The enemy will lose",Withering Away
Kalmah,"A man highest in rank
Always commands
Obeys the will
Of the mighty word

Wealth is all he wants to reach
Don' t give a damn to our land

[Chorus]
He cannot see what is happening in our world
Our system falls by his hand 
Conqueror' s end

With toxic waste master creates
Catastrophes that lead to the end

A bio-war man never can win
Technology his only reward

[Chorus]

Twisted creation of mankind

[Chorus]",The Blind Leader
Kalmah,"Breaking loose from reality surrounding me
Keeping you bonded in my imagination
Drifting away within the limits of consciousness
Falling in sleep with memories you left for me

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left 
Inside me

Restless dream stiring up in my head
Shakes up my sweaty body from torture
Waking up in empty room filled with dark
Asking myself will this reality never end?

[Chorus]
Where are you, my wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up my hollow heart?

Please god never let me fall asleep
Make me real, keep away from my imagination
Dishearten mind, still looking for another answer
Hopeless act, action speak louder than words

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left 
Inside me

[Chorus]",Hollow Heart
Kalmah,"A man on the corner with glassy look
Telling a story of his lifetime
A thousand times told, desperate verse
But never listened

Another on by the bar talking to a barmaid
Has spent his whole life there
A naively trusting man never faced life
Or has just found Eldorado
Life is nothing but a gift

[Chorus]
Poor human fates
Pure human fakes
No human rights
The underrated

The third one by the table never said a word
Gazing into the distance
The observer, melancholic man 
Just drinking heavily

Not very old but still a veteran
Has lost his thread of life
In god-forsaken place they are the family
And they are at home
Life is nothing but a gift

[Chorus]

Use of education is not complete solution
Now it is time to look in the mirror

[Chorus]",Human Fates
Kalmah,"A pioneer of humanity
Declaring his truth to the crowd
Word of wisdom is what he speaks
Wisdom he has never reached

A well-educated know-it-all
But never has done anything
Collects info from sources 
The vice man has left behind

[Chorus]
Kill the idealist
Get him a job
Kill the agitator
Capital rules the world

So let him found a labor
On his own certain conditions
And try to heal society
Without support

[Chorus]",Kill the Idealist
Kalmah,"Waves of change creep over promised land
We have gathered in our secret stand
Time has come for us to carry through the plan
The bond of oppression have to be unchained

[Chorus]
Those in power, overthrown, revolution, found my nation

So my brother raise your scimitar
Join our legion in the name of god
Together as one we will fight till the end
Oppressive despots will be sent to hell

[Chorus]

Everlasting confederation
Never-ending condemnation

[Chorus]",My Nation
Kalmah,"See him on Tv-screen doing the rightest thing
Always being at the top of our blessed nation
With white smile in his face he lives on the fat of the land
And he makes you feel sarcastic

Feel him stuck in your brain and in your every move
He is showing you the way what to do
So raise your inner voice wipe the smile off his face
Let your feelings rise and decide

Kalmah,"I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

[Chorus]
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck to see in time
The white light's a train
Bearing down on me

[Chorus]

I won't feel the hurt
I'm not trash any longer
That that doesn't kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
That's what 911 is for
So, tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh to close the drawer

[Chorus]",Skin o' My Teeth
Kalmah,"Watery rubber boots
On the field of moss
Inside the boots weary legs
Of the man I always meet

Swamp full of mist
Icy embrace
Nothing left of
Sense of direction

[Chorus]
Swamphell
Kill me, let me sink in your lap

Once was the air crystal clear
Secular joys were so near
Glory days have left behind
Swamplord calls now misty mind 

Swamp full of mist
Icy embrace
Nothing left of
Sense of direction

[Chorus]

When there is nothing left on the surface
And the wind is blowing slow
Under the carpet of moss
Finally I meet my Swamplord",Swamphell
Kalmah,"Rhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defense

My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report

They rise into the air and fly away

[Chorus]
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge

[Chorus]

Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again

They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
But they will return!",They Will Return
Kalmah,"Thoughts of hope in the minds of those whose
Lives are on decline
A thousand lies told them with bright eyes
And believed without doubts of employment 
Now itÂ´s time to think very positive
Deny all the evil things
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen

Purity behind the mask of innocence
Weakness of this world
Blind-eyed fools will never rise from unfairness
Until theyÂ´ll join the Good!

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen

The carrier of the crown of thorns
Hides behind a dollar smile
And will judge the Poor!

So letÂ´s throw away all our useless hope
Nothing will ever change!
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen",Bird of Ill Omen
Kalmah,"There is a net under the ice
With a thousand knots tied
And unchecked amount of slime
Hanging down 
There is a burbot on the net
Into the mesh he has put his head
Now struggling for his life
Entangling more and more
And there is a fisherman on the ice
Drilling a hole with sweat and blood
Trying to draw the net above
The icy surface
But even though how hard he pulls
The net won't budge
Under the ice the net has stuck 
With thousand knots into the ground
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds
Burbot's revenge

With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength

Kalmah,"You take a frogÂ´s eye and give it to a man 
Pleased with your cyborg proudly you stand
This glorious madness that is not in gods hands
Makes you believe youÂ´re all powerful 
This inhumane robot 
Becomes a heathen god

Will be idolized and takes all control
Spreads over the planet and infects us all
With this evil act the main race will be

Kalmah,"Things move when IÂ´m not watching them 
They have their own will
And I donÂ´t even feel insane
Because I know IÂ´m ill 
I know there is an eye and IÂ´m under observation
I am a marked man got some information

Governments use millions for supervision
Global message interception
Satellite receivers of Echelon system
Carnivore technique for digital control

It is said that terror lives behind the wall of privacy
But what do the rights really mean in our society?

Finger prints, personal I.D, credit card, database
A paradox of privacy

Kalmah,"In the middle of nowhere
Where the wild spruces grow
Stands a man with his chainsaw
Gloomy thoughts in his mind 
Until my foot has gone to sleep I must have sawn
A million blocks of wood, no payment before
What a hell did I do wrong to deserve this trade
Feels like IÂ´m a marionette, an errand boy, a slave

But I never give up
I will never give up

Gnawing bones, muscle cramps, backache
Coldness, warmth, heavy rains, mosquitoes
And this goddamn saw that will never work
But with a madmanÂ´s eyes I carry on, nothing they can do

Kalmah,"I've chosen my way of life IÂ´ll drink my every coin
And even if IÂ´m broken IÂ´ll drink my homemade moonshine
Until it is all in my head and I will meet my fellows
Those who creep around at nights and will not allow me 
To be acceptable, to be respectable, to be normal,
To be a decent man
But IÂ´m neurotic, I am vehement, I am withdrawn,

We will gather in your neighborhood to reach our destination
We will drink our past, weÂ´ll drink our future for you my friend

And lifetime filled with happiness

So great is the sea so small your boat
But you don´t know if you don´t row
And so great is the sky above your blue eyes
But you can´t see behind the lies

In the smallest crack of your life´s track
Is a chance for me to attack
Now the time is right for you to say
Your last goodbyes

Face yourself, your own dreams
I am your real demon hidden in your mind
I´ll show you my own world, I´ll take you down to the

Kalmah,"And she walks her way so treatled
Leads away from the bless sheÂ's earned
Gone away the meaning
Before the day against the morning

Down the path of the blind souls she walks
Through the dreams of mystery
Tryin' to reach the touch of human
Finds the way to the secret lands

Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts
Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts

Hymn of temptation keeps calling
Makes her to believe the dream
She wants to lay to rest
And to take away her veil

Soon will feel the touch of the Taker
And will see the eyes of the Caller
CanÂ't resist the feeling
Hand in hand they will fall into sleep

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz

Kalmah,"The groan of wind
A hiding deadly disease
A killer that hides in the wind
And cannot be seen
A powerful enemy a threat that truly exists
By a hair hung our lives
We see that but we're blind

Ever-transforming, reproductive, worldwide pandemic

Our time is running out
The clock is striking on
And in spite of our drugs
We'll stay powerless

The groan of wind
A silent killing machine
There's no place we can breathe
Deep down in our lungs symptom breeds

H5N1 Lethal time bomb

Maybe we have earned our urns
We cannot endlessly breed
Our scientific achievements
Nature simply will beat

Kalmah,"A condemned man in a prison cell charged with a crime he has done
He draws a picture on the wall a symbol of victory
He clothed peoples thoughts in words declared peace and liberty
The iron fist clenching his throat depriving humanity

A political prisoner a propagandistic weapon
Of the proletarian dictature against the other world
After he has been released
Got his name on the paper
A part of a macabre tradition
Released as a gift
And we´re all staring at the news
Nodding our heads in approval
We think that the the world is better now

Kalmah,"Waken by the scream of a buzzard
Sending cold shivers down his back

Now across the barren desert gallops a horse
The only thing alive maintaining hope
soon the steps will slow and horse ends up dead
The rider´s hope now gone too tired to resist

The bonfires behind his back
The chasers wait for their last attack
The long arm of law has reached him
This time he cannot fight back

Now walking in procession hands around his back
Surrounded by the people who only want him dead
In his eyes the look reminds he´s not ready to tap
Yesterday a hero now a victim of combat
In Judge´s eyes the look - you´re mine

To the gallows
Says the voice through the white hood
To the rope

In front of the law he resisted",To the Gallows

Those once were alive behind my eyes
And I'm on the crossfire of my manic thoughts

Why did you follow my footsteps?
Why did you present yourself against me?

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind
The things I've done
Over the plains, over the mountain tops
Covered with snow, to the unknown
Into the foreign lands there shall I go
But I know they're after me and it is my time to bleed

Those restless dreams keep on teasing
I can see your eyes just before you died
And the blood red scar between my shoulder blades
It's making me mad

Dead man's shadow
Wavering above me

Restless soul haunting me

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind

Kalmah,"Desperate cry of a child
Who only wants to live
An innocent human being
Deprived of all his dreams

Painful faces of the others
Who once were the chosen
Innocent eyes of the child
Never going to see

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation

Remembrance behind the scene
Of unjustice and injustice
In the forsaken faces
Expression of frustration

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation

Fuck, duck down, niggas is shootin
And I can't go out like Sir Isaac Newton
Catch a stray one, cause from day one I been escapin
So I figure I'm due for a yellow tapin
But it ain't today, thank God
So I kiss my mother and count my bank rod
And then it's back to the warzone
In Southern California you gots to get yours on
A real East Side Story
I'm talkin Compton and Watts, for thyne is the glory
A tale of two cities where it's non-stop drama
Not the Apollo joint
But from the hollow-point
-blank, I sleep to the sound of a siren
The shit is so tirin
And other nights I can't even crash
Without the same fuckin mutts turnin over my trash
It's just drama

It's just too much drama

One-time got my street blocked off
And I wonder what's poppin
But I ain't stoppin
>From what it look like a officer got smoked
And most likely it's from some shit he provoked
But regardless the police is kickin up dust
So now it's like 'in glock we trust'
And everybody in my hood is suspects
But ain't nobody snitchin, so what's next?
They try to break the unity
Make an example of a nigga to frighten the whole community
So put out an all-points bulletin and on Kam
And Watts-Up - goddamn!
Ain't nobody said a word
But now somehow I'm under the ghetto bird
On a high-speed chase
The right time in the wrong place
I caught drama

Damn, I just heard about the homie
That's fucked up, give my condolences to the family for me
Cause I know they took it hard
The shit caught us all off guard
That was my dog, he ain't never meant no harm
I went and got his name tatooed on my forearm
Right after the funeral
Goddamn, that's two in a row
Homeboys I done lost to gang violence
And I ain't been able to smile since
I know everything happen for a reason
But now the blood in my veins is freezin
Ain't no more feelings left, I'm cold-hearted
I wasn't dearly, but nearly departed
So I know I got a purpose
But L.A. is like a circus
It's too much drama

So another day, another dirty dollar
Like Marvin Gaye sometimes it make me want to holler
While I try to make a livin, I'm givin
You pee o-n t-h-e U.S.A. - hey
So how much for the ski-mask?
Ain't none of your business what it's for, so don't even ask
Cause America is on the fall
It's every man for himself and God for us all
And action speaks louder than words
>From what I hear the Mexicans got the birds
I seem em puttin up stores
I say it's time I kick in some casa doors
And play Robin Hood, I been good too long
Takin this shit, you can't expect me not to do wrong
So the stage is set for an Academy Award
And oh my Lord

Lift every voice and sing
Yeah, but we gon' lift every fist and swing
So save the negro spiritual
It's 1992 and niggaz need a miracle
And no more song and dance
like we shall overcome, and ain't got a chance
y'all stuck on ""I have a dream""
Need to put the picket sign down and get on the team
Stand up and do somethin
Stop beggin for a meal, cause everything is real
Nigga look at yourself, you in hell
Claimin wel-fare, or should I say fare-well
Mr. Christian, you was too spooky
Now Bush want to slave, and Russia want to nuke me
And the most you can tell me is love thy enemy?
Stay off the Hennesey
Pops I want freedom, so hand me the nine
You can pray for yours, but I'ma go get mine
Now how long has it been?
For a hundred and thirty-seven years, but neva again

[Kam]
God bless America.. but for what?
How bout God damn America, the slut (yeah)
Now I can name that tune
Cause the land of the free is sellin negroes at noon
But how soon we forget
Mention the holocaust, niggaz have a fit
Sorry it's real but I'm fresh out of tears
Cause lynch that nigga's still ringin in my ears
I want freedom, justice, equality, Islam
So it's hard to keep calm
when I'm accused of bein racist for lovin my people first
Now they want to put me in a hearse
but black people never made white slaves
And we was too lovin to put Jews in a oven
But the pilgrims wasn't so friendly then
And by the way, I never ate a Indian
So who's the real savage?
Six feet tall on the average
Mark the number of the God damn beast
To the East my brother to the East say neva again

Oh say can y'all see?
It's the home of the slave, land of the never free
America me, the so called negro
with another verse, so here we go
As long as y'all been givin me hell
No wonder there's a crack in the Liberty Bell
to tell on America the Beautiful
The bitch need a facelift, for this race myth
And now for you to pull a caper, kidnap rape her
The penalty is DEATH
Cause we ain't forgave or forgot
blacks bein murdered, tortured and shot
Six hundred million, one-eighty-sevens
It's bringin wrath down from the heavens
So let my people go Pharoahe, the arrow
is point at your dome, and if we don't make it home
Cancel Christmas
Like EPMD we got some ""Unfinished Business""
From way back, payback for your sin

Kam,"Don't call me nigga, whitey...

Big fat extra-crispy bucket of chicken
2 liter of pepsi-cola drinkin' ass...

They say a negro ain't good for nothin' but a show
Talkin' slang and walkin' with a radio
Drippin' sweat on basketball courts
Dominatin' but that's at all sports
Or inventin' a new kind of handshake
To get they picture on a box of pancake mix
So I kick some hip hop
And go to church sunday to hit me a flip-flop
But prayin' ain't all we do, see
Next we play bingo and barbecue
Them days I could praise the lord and still gamble 
And eat more dead meet than little black sambo 
But I gotta hear a lot of old ladies
Catchin' the holy ghost most in their 80's
And I don't want to hear no yellin'
Naw, I just kick it and finnish this watermelon
Cause I'm the stereotype...

They think all black folks look alike
We either goin' strike or hut, hut, hike
Or up on the microphone makin' their neighborhood nervous
So I get poor service
Wherever I go they steady tryin' to put jackets on me
Cause I ain't one of they fake-ass homies
Naw, I'm just a negro who knows what's jumpin'
So they be actin' like I'm tryin' to steal somethin' 
When I go to the store or out to eat
Ladies start puttin' purses by they feet
Pullin' a mace out they bras like one-time
Waitin' on some crime
For me to commit so they can unload
That's how tricks get floored
y'all can't let y'all imaginations 
Get the best of y'all
And that goes for the rest of y'all
Cause I'm the stereotype...

So I'm just your typical so-called african-american
Back in your hair again
At your door for more free 
butter and cheese, please
Let me take my cake-cutter 
And tease this buckwheat hairdoo
To fit the stereotype scenario 
That I gave on my application
Unemployment information
Like moms can't find no affordable housin'
How many kids she got? About thousand
And everyone got a different daddy
And I had to quit my job cause of my bad knees
But before my injury I was fine
Did everythin' from a jack to a shoeshine
I was allways down to work then
Until I got stretched out in the pen
Now I'm the stereotype...

So, yeah, i get it all from the big screen
Showin' black girls hoin' at sixteen
On the corner outside in the cold half-naked
Ain't nothin' sacred?
Cause all they know is what they seein' on daytime dramas
So now they like teenage grandmas
Who gotta stop they work and roll
To the nurse for a purse full of birth control
And that ain't so proper cause in my hood 
They need to cancel soap-operas
Cause black females be belivin' all that
That's why they fall flat
So young and innocent
But by the time they reach eighteen 
They been done went crazy, hittin' that P-I-P
Every Gladys Knight with the silent E
So I'm the stereotype...",Stereotype
Kam,"God damn devils, done finally made they move on South Los Angeles.
In Watts, the shots don't quit,

And in Compton, we got the same shit.
Damn pigs is puttin' in straight work,
Murderin' blacks and just smirk.
Ain't nothin' but another day at the office.
So now it's damn near illegal to be a negro.
So do I make a run for the border?
Or - fuck Bush, and his ""New World Order?""
The law is the straw that broke the camel's back;
Just one more punk attack
On the black, and now the shit is on.
(Peel his cap and I'm gone!) Oh yeah.
See, now all hell is finna break loose,
And Uncle Tom ain't got no juice.
Nigga shoulda been down from the start,
But he ain't had a heart, for another Watts riot.

So we done lost all patience.
(Man, fuck police investigations!)
See, we gon' handle this right, tonight.
(We're tearin' up everything in fuckin' sight!)
And I ain't got a damn thing to lose.
So the news gon' have they hands full,
Not to mention the police, fool.
No justice, no peace.
It's a eye for a eye, so don't even try and speak
On how blacks, should turn the other cheek.
To hell with all y'all devils.
Ain't no love losses for no white crosses.
So what y'all know about this interpretation,
With your college education?
Y'all best just keep quiet,
And get your ass ready for this next Watts riot.

Straight pandemonium! Niggaz, I'm with nutty,
Mr. MacGillicuddy, done got, got.
And I'm tossin' more cocktails loc,
'Til the whole fuckin' block smell like smoke.
Black folks are loc'n, no jokin'.
Yo Kam, grab the coke and choke 'em.
Make sure that somethin' is broken,
And then you can smoke him. (C'mon.)
Got a clip on the news of me, with a TV,
And I don't give a fuck, who done seen me.
Fightin' the police with my peers,
With head and shoulders, and no more tears,
And they can't stop me.
'Cause, I'm eatin' more crackers than Polly,
For the Jack that smoked the black.
I gotta do the right thing for you, and Rodney King;
Burn down his market.
But then you claim, Ice Cube had to spark it,
Puttin' Beverly Hills in fear.
'Cause Hollywood burnt down last year.
So if you throw me Ozzie and Harriet,
I fuck around and bury it, huh.
Ain't makin' the hood look shitty.
Watts riot, insert your city, motherfucker!

The whole city is on fire,
And now it's down to the wire.
Time to call for a national emergency,
'Cause white folk goin' up in smoke.
Too fast, they ass is out before they know it.
So when I light this cocktail, Cube throw it,
And make sure that it reach.
Yeah motherfucker, that's for Howard Beach,
And Brother Olivert X, so what's next,
With y'all punk-ass cowards?
Each of us bring fo' devils,
And let's get this over with, yeah, no shit.
We ain't worried about dyin'.

Kam,"Check
I represent the left, with a death toll high
But I ride with the side called the F.O.I.
Where do or die is the code, banged out is the mode

Now everyone throw up your guns and unload
I'm bound to have your whole town sewed, 
Niggaz drinkin' and gettin blowed
To the sound layin' tracks down like the underground railroad

Can't no jail hold me, or no crackers control me
I shed tears for dead homies (and what) and fears Allah only
So haters don't want me to hit, tryin' to pitch ball four
Makin' peace with the beast but with me, bitch it's all war

I'm hardcore, hardline, hard edge on hard times
Here rap the records determined to get our shine
Turnin' water to wine, healin' the deaf, dumb and blind
With a stone backbone, I join your own to your own kind
So pass the clip as I mash the whip, with the master grip
Just waitin' for your ass to slip and I bang bang

Way-oy..., way-oy....
Way-oy..., way-oy...

Ring the alarm, code red, arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Soldiers on the move, show and prove, go out and get the dead
And spit the lead, let's quit this black and brown bloodshed
And get this bread, lay these crackers down in a mudbed

Like Spud Webb I go to war with the giants
Cause they just pawns in the game but I'm a lord of the science
I gets 'nough respect, while other niggaz is suspect
Ass-kickin' cash get them pretty boys, slash roughnecks

[Chorus]

So cocks the hammer back and rack the pump
Since the police hate me, unlock the safety just in case we have to dump
I'm ready for shit to jump, my niggas carryin' mags
Like ""Fuck these United Snakes and they American fags""

Uncle Tom's askin' Uncle Sam, ""Why can't we bond?""
But nigga Kam don't give a damn about no Yankee man
Stars and stripes I earn 'em, blow a whole through they sternum
See my arrangement with the Lord is I return 'em, he burn 'em

But I don't claim to be no saint, solely because I ain't holy
But you just got believe, foley
Everybody on the block knows, just how it go
I got flows, rock shows, clock dough and knock hoes

Down like a pimp on the track, just mackin'
Out for my dollars pop your collars, holla back, what's crackin'?
Shit it's your world I'm just a squirrel tryin' to find a nut
Catch me at the club, in the cut, watchin' the girls, wind it up

And I respect who respects me, YES
It's the Kam, god damn I guess I am kinda sexy

But I ain't led on (what?) Turn up my headphone
You heard what I said, you gotta break bread

And I don't come cheap is what I'm sayin
So the only way I'm playin (is what?) Is if you payin like you weighin

Shit, you got me crossed up, baby you get tossed up
If I ain't have no spouse
you'd be hangin around my house like a lost pup
Beggin me to maintain and support her
So bad, I'd probably have to get a damn restrainin order

It's more to me than meets the eye boo-boo, or do you care?
You might just be in fo' a surprise, what size shoe you wear?

I know a spot that we can stop and get some bud and some drank

[Ms. Red Bone]
If I was stank maybe yeah but you got bank baby
See out yo' income, you gon' have to spend some on me
You try to shoot game at me but I shot it right back
I wonder why you niggaz figure that you got it like that


[Big Solo]
Cause I'ma hog baby, straight up, you think I'm ugly?
Well I keep it so real girls still want to fuck me
You see what gutter niggaz do to catch a houserat?
Just use peanut butter and a bigger mousetrap

[Ms. Red Bone]
I'm afraid it ain't that easy to please me (oh well)
I got too much class to be f**kin in some cheesy-ass motel

[Big Solo]
Shit, you can go to hell with that, cause if I really want to fuck
I'll have your ass buttnaked in the back of my truck screamin

So many women give that lay back to take a spin
in my wheels, I feels like Pat Sajak {*WOF: puzzle revealed*}

'c'mon big money! Big money!'

Oh you funny but sonny I ain't just some hoochie you can yank up
By the time you finished with this coochie you be bankrupt {*whistle*}
Drinkin fifths on the corner, shootin dice, countin rips

F**kin with me, you be swallowin more than your pride
I ride like Bloods and Crips between them hips

But if you want to bet then put some coochie where your mouth is
I'm pussy-whippin niggaz and laughin as I'm walkin out

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Night o'er the valley is creeping!

While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above,

To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

Kamelancien,"Le charme de la tristesse
Savoure, savoure, savoure
Kamelancien c'est du lourd comme Aznavour
C'est pour Yahya, Mamadou et Steeve
C'est pour Oujda, Bamako et Setif
J'viens tout niquer comme les Généraux en Algérie
Ouais la rue me kiffe, elle m'appelle ""mon chéri""
J'ai toujours pas d'femme j'fais l'amour à ma feuille
J'aime la misère, tous les jours elle m'accueille
Traîne à Kremlin, traîne a Krinihoud
J'fais toujours l'même chemin j'suis pas radin j'suis pas un lihoud moi
J'aime mes frangins, toujours à jeun, on rêve de compèt' on rêve de cage hein !
Les MC s'la pètent, mais qu'est-ce que tu veux frère,
mais qu'est-ce tu veux faire, ils ont rien dans la tête
À part des rimes, moi le rap c'est secondaire, la tête sur les épaules et les pieds sur le tèr-tèr
1, Jean 501, une paire de TN, un banlieusard, Kamelancien
J'suis simple comme mon hall, comme mon ghetto
Jamais d'anniversaire, jamais d'gateau
Et l'vieux 'adess dur comme la pierre
Et vive moi l'hass, moi j'kiff la hass
Tu réussis bsahtèk, moi je m'en fous
Bientôt l'rap c'est fini, bientôt je m'enfuis
J'pense au prophète Youssef, et la j'me dit ""c'est fou c'que j'suis dans l'zef""
La vie c'est pas dur, c'est l'homme qui rend ouf, la femme qui rend
ouf, l'argent qui rend ouf
On est pas reconnaissant, vive le Tout-Puissant
J'rappe en même temps j'pense à c'qui nous attend
Tu l'a bien deviné, j'suis un taré
Terré dans mon quartier, j'suis toujours paré
T'as la rage cousine, j'te calcule pas
Ne lui en veut pas, Kamel il est comme ça
J'répond jamais, avant personne me sonnait,
Maintenant un par un, tout l'monde me connaît
Les p'tits jeunes me tchèkent, prennent la confiance, j'résiste, à l'époque c'était direct violence
Lance, Bimbadaboum, toujours timide comme à l'époque des boums
Des fois j'reste chez moi, dehors y a rien a faire, y a rien a voir c'est toujours la même mon frère
On s'regarde vieillir, y a pas plus tard qu'hier, on était une bande de gamins qui attendait l'hiver
Le quartier nous a marqué, rien qu'on s'fait remarquer, si tu tombes j'suis là pour t'remorquer
On s'entraîne, à bas les traîtres! Des baffes dans leurs gueules, c'est comme ça qu'on les traite
J'suis fils aîné de la tristesse, elle m'a élevé, je l'aime, devant le monde entier je l'atteste

Avec elle j'suis bien, j'm'embrouille jamais
Elle m'a appris à m'relever, m'a appris à ramer
Elle a fait d'moi Kamelancien, un chien d'la rue
Hein rue ! L'égalité, moi j'viens d'la rue
Là ou, les darons galèrent à mort, la où la jalousie passe par les rats morts
Là ou l'Aïyn met fin à des carrières

L'autre jour j'ai rassemblé des mc dans mon hall j'les ai défendus
V'là le grand méchant loup, le méchant banlieusard je rode tard le soir
dans tous les tier-quar j'suis venu j'ai fait peur au rap, quand mc m'invite en featuring
dans la cabine, il met d'la mort aux rats, ils veulent me dead pour eux c'est dead
Les mc déçèdent et moi jamais je cède, J'suis de l'acide dans une soirée coca-cola
Oh la, même les ennemis font la olla, J'suis là les autres font pas long feu comme Fofana
Ils sont trop chim, ils devraient tous rapper en Chine

Dis-leur de ma part que leur flow n'est pas en règle
Revenons à nos moutons, il en reste quelques-uns en vie
De eux j'ai envie, le grand méchant loup vie la nuit,
Loupe jamais sa cible est décidément trop précis
Danse avec les loups danse la danse de guerriers
la danse des banlieusard, c'est la fête c'est toujours férié
Le rap m'a confié un secret en gros, il m'a dit de tout niquer en restant discret,
sacré, sacré mc c'est Kamelancien il n'est pas comme les autres
c'est ça qui est bien il en fallait au moins un parce que les autres se héchém

Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide

O Black Tower

Why do you devour?
The souls they sleep in the night
Casting evil shadows signs of no tomorrows
Why must I fear for my life?

And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide

I feel the waves crash upon the shore
As the sea sprays on my glowing face

As I lay my head to sleep at night
I dream the sea and me we flow as one
But I'm a prisoner of the sands and
no one understands these childish dreams

An old man approaches me
His feeble mind confusing to thee
He speaks in riddles and rhymes
Tales of an old witch that cast him
from the sea
But wait my eyes full of splendor
or could this be some crazy old tale
I look to his eyes for the answer

I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity

And so the journey begins
The pain and suffering
Are your dreams worth this torment?
You can deal Another hand
But the light in the distance
promises this the journeys end

Great god Poseidon

Eyes tell me what do you see?

Raging the knights in shining armor
Surely death awaits the weak

Plunging the northern seas
Crossing the blue horizon

Their fingers

And the cries for life that
I'd seem to ignore

Their Ears Ache For The Shrill Of The Horn,
But Roland Persists On Holding His Ground,

The world will cry a tear
In the heavens will appear another angel
Hear the elders cry
Waiting for their time
As they look towards the heavens
Why won't they answer?

We are playing with nature
Splitting the atom
Confusing religions
Killing the masses

We are not separate from what we destroy
Time has come for us to make the only choice
We are not separate from what we destroy
Time has come for us to make the only choice

We rape for our power
Not caring for life
We tarnish our waters
'Til they are as black as night
We visualize the future
With the eyes of the blind
We hear nature calling
But we still deny

We are not separate from what we destroy

Mighty kingdoms shall rise
Crystal ships have returned
Like pawns on a distant shore

There's a cold empty place inside
Where you know there's no end

I'm a creature of the night

All my demons cast a spell 
The souls of dusk rising from the ashes
So the book of shadows tell 
The weak will always obey the master

Heading for the dragons lair 
Another time and a different sphere
I leave the nothingness behind
And when the sense of logic yields
I'll escape the outer shields
Into the universal mind

I get stronger in the splendor
Of a lucid moon
Only creatures of the night 
Can heal my wounds",The Spell
Kamelot,"I see you when it snows
In crystals dancing down
From a sultry sky
When silence is pure and unbreakable 

I can see you smiling
In every frozen tear
I can hear you whisper ""You and I?

Little did we know 
That they were life itself
The days passing by
We both had our share in the sacrifice

Once upon a time 
We had something beautiful
Once upon a time 
I thought ""you and I?

Take me wherever 
The answer lingers in the sand
Show me the way as the story unfolds
Love is remote 
In this wailing winter wonderland
Show me the way to the temples of gold

Bless me with a kiss
Across the universe
When day and night converge
And whisper my name till I fall asleep

Tell me tales from days bygone
Tell me little lies
Tell me once again it's just ""you and I?",Temples of Gold
Kamelot,"Sometimes my visions
Are distant and vague
Down at the base
Of the mountain
Once in a while I am
Weak and afraid
Tired and sick of it all
I don't believe
That my story is set
Nothing is destined
Or blatant
Bound to this body
A world full of hate
No one will heed if I fall

No one can see it
But you know that it's there
Guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth
In the cross that you bear
Die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning
Remember
No one can save you today

The questions are more
Than the answers I know
That doesn't mean you are lonely
Searching for more
Consecutive goal's
Making it worth to go on

No one can see it
But you know that it's there
Guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth
In the cross that you bear
Die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning
Remember
No one can save you today

You, and you alone
Is forging the path
Leave your sorrows with the past

Never believe
That the story is set
Nothing is destined
Or blatant
Bound to this body
A world full of hate
No one will heed if you fall

No one can see it
But you know that it's there
Guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth
In the cross that you bear
Die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning
Remember
No one can save you to

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning

No one can save you
No one can save you
No one can save you today",Wings of Despair

Kamelot,"I recall one summer's night
Within the month of June
Flowers in mahogany hair
And smell of earth in bloom
Only such a melody
Comes without a sound
More than faintly heard by those
Who know what they have found
Now it's just a memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night

Meet me by the wishing well
In cover of the moon
Whisper to me tenderly
That I will see you soon
Sing that song from long ago
So I remember you
Flowers in mahogany hair
And mellow days in June
Only for the memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night

From ashes we were born
In silence we unite",Wander

So take me cross the river wide

On my soul
Grand delusions lead astray
Ice-cold wings swept my heart away

As the autumn leaves flew by
Until one day, she told him, ""This is when I die""

""What was summer like for you?""
She asked him with a smile
""What's tomorrow without you?""

She said,

""I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
Cause I love you, I love you to death""

But the sorrow went too deep
The mountain fell too steep
And the wounds would never heal
Cause the pain of the loss was more than he could feel

I just can't stand the waiting
To revive ecstasy

It's time again
All light is spent
My soul is free
And blessed to see

Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

I won't sustain another day
My love, my darkness
Daylight reflects my starving soul
And open wounds for everyone to see

Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

Kamelot,"Once my life was plain and clear
I recall
Once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came
Like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind

Why oh why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

Binding promises were made
On my soul
Grand delusions lead astray
Ice cold wings swept my heart away
Bring me back to you

Why oh why my god
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

Kami Kaze Inc,"[ Intro ]
Sometimes I write about something, that like something I went through
Or something my people went through
And I felt like they needed some motivational shit
And it usually ends up going something like this...

( Chorus )
My first day, without you in my life
Things felt strange, a bit deranged
Even so, I hope you're doin okay
Take it slow, you just never know... ( just never know, oh!)
Yo, you just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)
You just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)

( Verse 1 )
My systems caught in conniption, stomach in knots
Feedin for my medicine, overcoming addiction
The first step is quittin, nah the first steps admittin
I got a problem, I need help, this is something I can't beat myself
I almost felt like I can't be cured
Rehab won't take me 'cause I ain't insured
Layin in the bath tub, shakin like a new born
Searchin for the courage it'll take for me to move on
I've been livin life like this way too long
Beggin God please, bring me home
I stopped before, three or four days
Always end up back in the same place
People call me a junkie, dope fiend
How they gonna judge me, they don't even know me
Lights off, want to be left alone, I'm tryin to enjoy the methodone
Put a Jimi Hendrix record on, and excuse me while I kiss the sky
Dosed off, woke up, sick to my stomach, ran to the bathroom
Started to vomit, the methodone wore off and the withdrawal started
That first day was the hardest...

( Chorus )

( Verse 2 )
Stayed strong, endured the rough weather
I ain't fully recovered but I'm doin much better
I can keep my food down to shakes and calms
They lowerin the doses of methodone
I eat V's and blow lots of dro
It's like chewin gum when you're tryin not to smoke
Keep my mind occupied, calm my nerves
It's not the same high, deep inside I...
Just want one more but I can't turn back this week for it
But I done made it, almost a month
With just a couple of V's and I blew some blunts
But that weed and gonna make me OD
That other shit was gonna kill me
Six weeks, and everything seem so clear
Before I knew it, time flew and I was clean for a year
Can't believe something started off socially
Something I almost allowed to take over me
Days went by and it was sixteen months
And I swear to God I didn't fall off once
I, feel like a brand new guy and I'm definitely livin a brand new life
Some days I still resist the thirst but none's worst than the first (believe
that)

( Chorus )

( Verse 3 )
Two years and I ain't touched it
Got a lot done, I been so productive
Rebuilt, I was so constructive
Can't believe I was so self destructive
Got a good job and I make big bucks
Went to the lot and got a new pick up
Got a brand new crib and a brand new kid
I think anybody can quit if I did
If you want to quit, get up and go get the shit
Walk straight to the toilet, drop it, flush it, fuck it, fight it
Just resist it and if this helps then just keep listenin
When you start slippin I'll send you another one
Sonny, wasup?, we just saved another one
I know it's so hard like there's no God
But through him you're able to go so far
Hey, I don't want to sound corny
I'm just like you either hungry or horny
Seems as though we get hooked so easily
Quitting becomes an impossibility
I ain't sayin treat your body like a church
Just don't let dope put your body in a hearse
The streets inside you, you just gotta search
And know that no day be harder than the first

( Chorus )

[ Outro ]
Yo, all my people, goin through they thing
Whatever they thing may be
Just know, God got his hands on you
And he'll grant you the serenity
To change the things you can't
And you can change that, aight
Hold me down and I'ma hold you down... one",Sprang on 'Em

Kami Lyle,"My paper cuts have turned maroon 
The color of my bow 
I tied it like a noose today 
And I almost got sent home

'Cause I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And that southern sun is in my eyes 

And chickens keep on drifting down 
In plastic bags of red 
With turkey necks and smoked hog jowl 
And none of it looks very dead 

And I'm a vegetarian 
And I'm not from the South 
But if I were you, I'd bury them 
Not put them in my mouth 

But I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And there's something 
Something in my eye 

And Mister is a blind man 
With a smile pure as the Pope 
And as I help him find his way 
He whispers me all his dirty jokes 

He offered me a ruby locket 
One day behind the store 
But he couldn't make me want it 
'Cause I've heard that one before 

And did I come here to chase the truth 
Or to run away from lies?
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And I'm so tired I want to cry 

But I met Harlan Howard here 
And I smiled at Lee Sklar 
And now I'll sit and sneak a beer 
While I sing my songs for these dusty cars 

'Cause I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And maybe so should I",The Grocery Song
Kami Lyle,"As a family of lawn chairs gathered 
Underneath a clean suburban sun 
There were seven pink flamingos 
Standing pigeon-toed, not hurting anyone 
Her mama called her ""Precious"" 
And her daddy called her once or twice a year 
When she was five, she practiced magic tricks 
In hopes that she could make him reappear

And she'd say, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And pray a little prayer 
Then she'd wave her hands 
Like butterflies 
And make a big red heart 
In the air 

Her best friend was Angie 
They played Barbies after school for three whole years 
And on weekends they'd have cider 
On the railroad tracks, pretending it was beer 
Just like family till Angie's front yard 
Grew a sign that said ""Just Sold"" 
And the tears that came on moving day 
Were more than hearts that small could ever hold 

So they said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart 
In the air 

And daddy never showed 
And Angie never wrote 
But there's always hope 

In a pile of broken daisies fell decisions 
At the turning of her life 
There was a boy she was in love with 
And he'd asked her if she'd want to be his wife 
But they were both from broken families 
And quaking at the thought of taking vows 
So they shared a secret wedding, just the two of them 
And they're still together now 

They said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart 
They said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart

Dusty old sunbeams 
And a handful of pennies 
You whisper your wishes all to

Here in the dark I appear in your room 
You'll say you love me 
But I'll never hear it 
That ain't what they wrote on my tomb

When all of the lights have gone down 
Spooky and faded 
With clowns drunk and jaded

Somewhere inside my mind 
Neon blue sign used to hang out here 
Blinking cool under a July sky 
We used to dance to the faded blues 
Of the hand-me-down grooves 
Wearing nothing but the beat 
The summer was all that we had to lose 
In a room full of two fools

At the Midnight Club again 

There's a trumpet wailing the night away

Give you strength to die alive

Words: Gyle Waddy			Music: Kana Bukuru Lesouple

Don?t worry about the things you've been through
what ever happened was meant for you.
Sometimes it's hard to understand,
but if you only try you, you can.
Yes, one day you're up and wearing no frowns.
You think you know the plan. You're on sure grounds.
Then suddenly your days turn gray,
don't worry 'cause life's that way.
You've had your love. You thought it was true
the joy that it gave, now it's the blues.
Money you've made hundreds by the day.
Oh you played now it's gone away.
Now it's gone away. Now it's gone away.

Everything must change.
Nothing remains the same.
No one is to blame it's just that way
life is one big game.

Sometimes you find your energy is high
you run around you have stars in your eyes.
Without a warning all is through,
you think that you've been voodooed.
And even though rainy days do come,
and you find you have no song to hum
just look into yourself and say
that tomorrow's another day.
Now don't you worry. Don't pay it a mind
just keep your thoughts on the brighter side.
Don't worry about tomorrow
even though there'll be some sorrows. 
Some sorrows. Some sorrows.

Everything must change.
Nothing remains the same.
No one is to blame it's just that way
life is one big game.

No, don't you worry believe me it's true
there's no difference from me or from you.
So don't let life get to you.
No, don't let life out-do-you.
Don't let life out-do-you.

Everyone, everywhere
I've been thinkin' a lot about
mankind and I have doubts.
I'm afraid things aren't going that good.
Seems to me 
that this world is turning wrongly.
Thanks to man for his modern technology, 
to science advancements for everything 
that help us live easily;
help us live very com'tably,
but there's a question that that I ask myself, 
'Why so much ignorance, insolence  
turned against them who have less chance?'
When we see people bleeding, suffering, dying
why can't we help them without demanding 
that they give something in return? 
Why not give peace to all mankind?
I hear a mother's sigh, baby's cry, 
hungry eyes that are full of flies.
Child warriors taught by men:
Little girls that are sold they're innocent.
Such a crime. Now's the time! 
Stop these horrors let's clean those ignorant minds.
Stand against inhumanity!
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's have peace!
Come on!  For mankind!
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Kana:
It's our lives. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's make peace the bottom line
There's no choice. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
It's your life! Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.

We have to stop all these atrocities 
that are going on in the world. 
There's too much pain, too much hurt, 
come on let's put our hands together. 
Let's stop the war. Let's help those kids 
who need help. All those people out there 
want the same thing as you do, as I do. 
We have to keep on going. 
We have to keep our faith strong. 
You see without humanity there's nothing. 
We are the chosen people. We have to do it. 
If we don't do it what's going to happen? 
Let's give peace to mankind. 
Let's put our hands together. Let's hold each. 
I think it's time to do that right now. 
Come on put your hands together. Hold each other. 
Come on it's now, I would say it's now or never.

In positions that weren't cool

You know we've been through this before
So you can't come back, you can't come back

You're in and out of my life
This time was your last try
You made your bed, so there you lie
So you can't come back

The last time you deceived me
You said give you one more chance
You blamed it on your weaknesses
Of just being a man
I was a fool to believe in you
Put my heart in your hands
I shoulda known when you did me wrong
You'd just do it again

Please just leave, no convincing me
You will ever be the man for me
I'm so sick and tired

Just pack your bags

But still, there wasn't enough
Gave you my heart and soul, total control

I could not imagine life without you
It was such a painful thing to go through

But I, I dried my tears
Even though it took a couple of years
I guess I had to just get over my fears
Of bein' alone

Thought I would be oh so sad darlin'
'Cause you left me here to face all my fears
All by myself, with nobody else
Now that you're gone, I just gotta move on
But my love'll never change
It'll always stay the same
I felt you were gone, the lonely nights alone
I get weak, then I'm strong

I cry so much there's no reason to wipe my eyes
Way down deep inside my mind
I still deny that I must say goodbye
To the one I thought would always be mine

Now I believe that what we give comes back to us in time
And I believe that if you search for long enough you'll find
What you always knew to be the truth was right before your eyes
And so if I, if I have to let you go

Wherever you go
If there's a road that leads you back my way
I'll be at the end of that road
Just so you know
I, I'm gonna be there

There's just no easy way to prepare for something like this
Cause you never know just what you'll do
Until the moment exists
See, I tried to tell my heart to just behave
My lips want to beg you to stay, but it'll be okay

If I can convince my arms to let you go
Now, I don't know how I'll ever get over this
Cause there's this chance
That you might find somebody else

I'm hoping the odds are all against it
But if you do and it's not what you want in your heart
If it's tearing you apart, you need to come on back here

Something precious, set it free

She got my back, like 'sho 'nuff
""You talkin' bout me""And when I find him, I'm gonna keep him all I can
You'll never catch me stressin' him 
You'll only find me lovin' him
I'm a real woman who wants a real man
And when I meet him, I'll give him all I can
You'll never find me trippin' on him
I'll only be givin' love to him

You talkin' 'bout me
Bout me
Boy, don't you see
That you talkin' 'bout me
Bout me
Boy, don't you see

From the first time I met her
I knew she was heaven sent
After bomb sex and it's been on ever since
Caramel complexion, lips sweet as candy
Perfect vision, standin' in a T-shirt and panties
And then we get to the sheets
And next to me at the Grammys
Thick and thin, got a 'Best Friend' like Brandy
Never stressin' when I run the streets wit my family
Sometimes it seems that she's the only one that understands me
No need to creep, she knows what I like
And on top keeps me laced from my neck to my Nikes
When I'm broke, holds me close on cold nights
Accepts my collects I'm lookin' to spoil right
I been searchin' my whole life for Ms. Right
Home cooked meals and good sex
Just a little bit of spice
Wit my luck, I know I'll only get one in this world
And that's West Side Riders love
With this big southern girl

My woman's gotta have skills in the kitchen
She's gotta keep it real with nothin' missin'
""You talkin' bout me""
And when she hangin' with her friends gettin' tipsy
She call me where she at and say she miss me
""You talkin' 'bout me""
She gotta give me good lovin' through the night now
No matter where she at she be like 'right now'
""You talkin' bout me""
And when a brother's goin' through some of that raw stuff
She got my back, like 'sho 'nuff

Heard you in the booty club
Tryin' to get new love
I wanted to scream and shout
But I went home
Just picked up the phone
Cleared your bank account out
It's gonna be such a shame
What I'm gonna do to you
Revenge is a must
When my heart you crush
You know I'm goin' burn yo' house to dust
Cause a girl really gets so serious
When you really make a girl so furious
It's such a shame

That I'm goin' let you get away
With all these games that you're playing with me
Cause I kept seeing the signs
But I ignored them anyway
I once was a blind but now I see
Cause when you came home last night
You just wasn't smelling right
And that look in your eyes
Is telling me what is going on
What the hell is that smell

That you left behind
And I got a better me
It took so long to find
I've got a lot of nerve
Mmm to ask you back at all
And I put this picture of you and me
On the hole in the wall 
Ain't touched a bottle in so long
'Cause now the only thing I ain't got
I was kinda hoping you'd prove me wrong
You'd give me one more shot
You'd give me one more shot 
And I got this old shag rug
We used to crawl on
And I got this telephone
That you used to call me on
But since that last goodbye
Well, the phone don't ring
I've got this empty home
Filled with so many things 
Ain't touched a bottle in so long
'Cause now the only thing I ain't got
I was kinda hoping you'd prove me wrong

Kane,"It's been a long time since I've wore this rattle snake smile
A lot of my friends haven't seen it in quite a while
I feel my eyes rollin' deep inside my head
And there's a feeling of misconception in the air
Then I started to see 
I do believe
Well I use to have a soft Southern glowing face
And I used to leave my heartaches with the chase
When you get stung with a heart of a little child
Well that's how you get that rattle snake smile
Well you better keep your distance from this stinger and shape I'm in.
Now no one better touch me right now in this cold blooded thick skin
Aww I think you better run real fast when you hear that rattling sound
Well you better run real fast man or this one's gonna knock you down
I sit alone and try to shed this skin that I'm livin in 
We're trying to clear my vision once again hoaw!
Well I ain't no good and no no how matter right now
'Cause I got to run myself and I've got to run now
Do I look like something you can put in a fucking cage?
Come on over here and give me a kiss
I I I started to see
I I I do believe
Better keep your distance from this stinger and shape I'm in
Now no one better touch me right now in this cold blooded thick skin
Yeah well nah son you better run real fast when you hear that rattling sound
Well son you better run real fast man or this one's gonna knock you down

Kane,"There's a little girl down south 
And her daddy's got a ranch about as big as my town
And one day I swear I'm gonna go down there and get her out
From the letter that I got last fall 
It says you know you're the one I love most of all
But My face is up on the sheriffs wall and there's reward signs posted up and down 
The Red River Line that I cross out every night
Trying to find my heart and looking for a fight, and there were four guards 
Standing on the wall I drew two six guns and I watched them fall, oh yeah
Well I came busting through them gates into a twelve gauge and a thirty-eight,
But I was quick on the draw and I got em all, yelled out to Rosa Bella,
And she came walking softly through the night,
With her hair so long looking at me with those big blue eyes,
Well I grabbed her hand and we ran to leave,
But her daddy came running from around a tree 
And said ain't no way my daughters leaving here with no Cherokee
Well it might it reach into his surprise
I looked him deep in his buckshot eyes
And he had his hand on his gun but I was holding mine
And I'm runnin down this Indian highway
with a bottle of red
I've got a loaded gun and things are going my way for a change 
Well you might think that I'm gonna be swinging from the trees
Although I'm a spirit boy...
Ain't nobody gonna catch me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah and numerous other sounds
We made love that very night
Under a burnt auburn Cancun sky
And I guess now I'm a Mexican cause in Texas I'm a wanted man
She got up in a long white gown
For the man that shot her daddy down
Somewhere around in the heat of the night there was a shot
And I'm running down this Indian highway
With a bottle of red
I've got a loaded gun and things are going my way for a change yeah
Well you might think that I'm gonna be swinging from a tree
Although I'm a spirit boy
Ain't nobody gonna catch me
Yeah I'm a spirit boy
Ain't nobody gonna catch me
Yeah I'm a spirit boy
Ain't nobody gonna catch me

Kane,"It gets wetter and when spring rolls along
It's hotter than hell than when we met last fall
It gets better and better every time we touch
A sticky situation we're in
We're trapped in the car and it's raining again
And girl every time it stops
Lord, I miss it so much
And I want to take the top off
And throw it in the barn, man
And just put it in drive 
Run into that
Sweet Carolina Rain 
(Sweet Carolina Rain)
In that Sweet Carolina Rain 
(Sweet Carolina Rain)
We would drive on out to the river again
Just-a prayin' to god my ship comes in
I'm just a modern day Tom but an old Huck Finn
Get my guit
Pick her out the trunk
And get pickin' boy just to bring me some luck
And I will sweep her off her feet like the southern wind
It's really comin' down now
Yeah, well
It's really comin' down now 
In that Sweet Carolina Rain 
(Sweet Carolina Rain)
Yeah that Sweet Carolina Rain 
(Sweet Carolina Rain)
It's soakin' wet in the middle of the afternoon
A little honky tonk
Heavy pettin and rye
Playin' David Allen Coe
Well, please come to Boston too
Yeah, reaching for a little piece of that pie
I pray a man loves to feel the rain on his face
Well, they eat it up now
Preacher man's daughter said I was goin' to hell
And I'm a little superstitious now
Driving down the road going a hundred and ten
Braggin' to your mama's little boy he's a man
You swear you'll never feel that way again
No not 'til you're back in that

Yeah that Sweet Carolina Rain

I've been questioning nights.
Though my heart is awake,
Life is passing me by.
I prayed to the moon, the silent rain,
To lift me up and then,
Heal me again.

I've been questioning times,
I've been questioning thoughts.
Inside these ivory walls,
Within this ivory heart.

Love like a ghost,
My only friend,
Would seal me up and then,
Leave me again.

I don't know how,
And I don't know where to go,
'Til it lifts me up, 'til it fills me up,
And I'm back again,
All alone.

I've been waiting too long,
Contemplating my bet.
I expected too much,
So you bitterly fled,
Crashed into the wall,
Of the final round.
Was saved from the flames,
But burned to the ground.

And i don't know where to go.

And let you know,
That this is written only,
Only for you.

That we're in it,
That we're in it for life.
I feel different now ok.
Please, well,
I am still around.
You know that right.
Sometimes I got the feeling that you don't.
I got the feeling that you don't
Sometimes,
I got the feeling that you can't.

I know I let you down,
But then I knew,
I always would.
Some things feel better now,
But then I knew,
They always would.

So don't you stay,
Oh don't just wait,
Oh don't you know,
I had to let you go.

Still I miss your crazy warnings,

Still here,

Let me touch you like I never did before.
Take my heart and let me love you,
Like I never did before,

And we see ourselves no more.
When we're closing every door,
It's so much harder than before,
So before you let me go.

Before you let me go

Save the dance and let me spin you,
Till your world is turning round and round,
Round and round, round and round.
Save the chance and let me show you,
Just like you need a little more,
Just like you need a little more.

And I should have tried just to talk about it,
Waiting, ending.
I should have tried just to let you know,
That I'm still here.

But we waste it every time,
Now my heart is on the line,
Until we see ourselves no more.
When we're closing every door,
It's so much harder than before,
So much harder than before.
So before you let me go

Before you let me go

But we waste it every time,
Now my heart is on the line,
Until we see ourselves no more.
When we're closing every door,
It's so much harder than before,
So much harder than before.

Now my heart is on the line,
And now we bruise with every step.
When we're closing every door.
Can we make it easier.

Kane,"Here's the palm of my hand for a life to see,
Here's the thunder-rage as a part of me,
Here's the beat of my heart,
Here's my reason for asking.

Sometimes when the sky falls down on me,
When the lightning flash leaves a stain in me,
I feel the beat of my heart,
It's my reason for asking.

Yeah

Sunrise on a worldwide boulevard,
New dice on the edge of a brand new start,
Every day is a day,
Is a reason for asking.

One step for the free fall ride in you,
One dive into the dark, deep sea of truth,
No one knows where to go,
So you might as well take it.

Till it feels so real,
And you're free.

Time flies as the world walks out on you,
Toss, turn, it's the catch in 22,
Don't you know, don't you know,
There's a reason for asking.

Sometimes when your head caves in with doubt,
You feel like a fool with no way out,
Feel the beat of your heart,
It's the reason for asking.

Until it feels so real,
Till your mind reveals.
Until it feels so real,
And you're free.
Until your heart cries out,
Until there's no way out.
Till it feels so real,
And you're free.

Reach out when your heart screams out to you,
It's the quest for a lifetime search in you,
Put the pace into place,
There's a reason for asking.

Sometimes when the worst is all you see,
You're as free as you'd thought you'd ever be,
No one knows where to go, so you might as well taste it.

Until it feels so real,
Till your mind reveals.
Until it feels so real,
And you're free.
Until your heart cries out,
Until there's no way out.
Till it feels so real,
Till you're free.",Free
Kane,"So I've been waiting for the fall,
I've been waiting for the crash,
Wait a minute Mr. Man,
Can't you see this is the end,
But this is no goodbye. (No way man, no no)

And I've been calling out your name,
Oh at least a million times.
So wait a minute Mr. Vain,
You got caught up in the game,
But I am still around, I will stay around.

Until you see me, you hear me,
Till you reach out and feel me.
I can't discover why my love was never healing,
I can't discover why all you do is suffer,
You've got to keep holding on,
You see the worst, but I want the best.

Hold the line,
For every single ray of light.
You've got to hold on,
You've got to hold on.
Read the signs,
In every truth, in every lie,
You've got to hold on.

I'd like to thank you very much,
You overrated little prick.
And I'd like to tell you this much baby,
I want you to be here another day.
For I'll be calling out your name.
So wait a minute Mr. Saint,
For we are heading for the end,
So this will be goodbye. (This gonna be goodbye right? Goodbye!)

Until you trust me, you hear me.
Till you learn not to fear me,
I can't believe the fact that you're only out to hurt me.
I can't discover why all you do is suffer,
You've got to keep holding on,
You see the worst, but I need the best.

Kane,"Well the answer is always the same,
Won't you please just let it be.
'Cause I've been there and all I can say,
Is that it slips away from me.
With the memory of yesterday's grace,
She spins away from me,
So I can go on.

As cold as the void of the night,
The dark's surrounding me.
She leaves me there every time,
As alone as I can be.
And I drift with the thought of her eyes.
She's all that I can see,
But I will go on.

Every long night,
Every whisper,
Every song that never saw it coming,
And she says it's oh so right.

Every cold night,
Every shiver,
Every time I didn't feel it coming.
She says it's oh so right.

As heartless and cruel as can be,
She moves away from me.
Still I need to be hers every time,
With all that I can be.
As she calls in the deep of the night,
She takes all I've got from me,
So I can go on.

Every long night,
Every whisper,
Every song that never saw it coming,
Baby don't you know that it's not alright,
It's not alright, no, no, no.

Every cold night,
Every shiver,
Every silent scream,
And she never listens.
Well it's not alright, not alright.

She rides with the gods of the night,
She rules the tides in me.
She crushes the waves with her sigh,
And she, oh lord, becomes a part of me,
But her care is as sharp as a knife.
I'll say, for how can she step away from me,
How can you just walk away from me?

Every cold night,
Every whisper,
Every silent scream,
And you never listen.
And you say what? It's alright,
Well it's not alright, no, no.

Every last time,
Every shiver,
Every dirty game.
Well it just isn't right,
It just isn't right.

She wakes at the dawn of the day,
And takes my heart from me.
Leaves me with nothing to say,
Nothing left for me,
But the fever of final goodbyes,
She spins away from me,
So I can go on 

I can go on.",Let It Be
Kane,"Mother,
Don't let me down,
I've been away, but I'm here right now.
And mother,
Don't let the past hunt you down,
Cause I've been away,
Well I'm here right now.
I've been away, but I'm here right now.

And I will be here.

So this time,
We won't speak a word.
I'll swallow my pride, oh I know, I know you're hurt,
And this time,
We'll run till the sun begs the night,
To give up the trail that you once left behind,
Oh she'll give up the trail that you once left behind.

I will be here,
And I will not fade.
I will not ever fade.

So come out and trust in the mercy of love,
And drive out the ghosts, that you see when I'm gone.
And reach out,
Rise like the sun in the sky,
Light up the dark nights, light the hard times,
On your way now.
Light up the hard times,
All the way,
Till you see me again.

I will be here.
And I will not fade,
I will not ever fade.

Right or wrong,
Life goes on,
So trust in love
Always trust in love

Boss chick you don't want to see her 

Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters 

Mia's right and left well known with the clout 

To wire your mouth, knock your grill out 

That's what this here be bout 

So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip 

Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit 

Too much to deal with 

I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man 

And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands 

My flow so grand it make the beats say damn 

Shit jumps back makes you want to holler 

But I sees nothing but dollars 

Feminist power 

My lyrics knocking like a KL beat 

It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her 

Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4 

How they still need a ladder to face this hoe 

For sure, cause I be living for the drama 

The biggest mama flexing shutting down this motherfucking basement sesion 

Shop closed",Basement Session
Kane & Abel,"featuring Master P  Silkk the Shocker 



(Master P) 

 Like 2Pac said  only God can judge me 

 But I think only black Jesus can help me 



Verse 1 (Kane) 



Six in the morning and I see the sunrise 

Wish I died in my sleep didn't want to open my eyes 

To see this world so fucked up for me 

And my family  worked so hard but can earn a decent salary  

these bills keep whooping a nigga ass 

Spent my whole check trying to dress with class 

I found myself having to smoke weed just to chill 

Both my parents got killed and I ain't cried still 

All my niggas getting shot, peoples mama's smoking rock 

And who the hell can stop these fucked up cops 

They like to overseaers and we like the slave bitches 

Offer pussy to a nigga even though they got AIDS 

You jumping in that pussy thatn you diving in the grave 

White man build the prison and the niggas come through 

Like the motherfuckers giving out free barbeque 

Lock a nigga up for life and say fuck you 

Most of ya'll ain't make it pass the 12th grade 

That's why you making minimum wage or slanging rocks for chump change 

a lot of people died for the right to vote 

We don't use white devils taking nigga land and missuse it 

On top of that I think my uncle on crack 

My boy Quay Shaun took a slug in his back 

>From another black now he in the coma trying to make it back 

Come on come on 

My old lady think she pregnant I ain't got no cash for her 

She probably fucking another nigga I wouldn't put it past her 

My mind got me murderous like John Doe 

Bitch ass niggas trying to play me like a hoe 

And now I'm rolling round sucking on a steel dick 

Bout to pull the trigger end it cause I'm tired of this bullshit 

Know what I'm saying grown men don't cry 

But the ghetto got me wheeping like a bitch I'm gone die on my knees 



(Chorus) 



Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up 

Allah, tell me why this world so fucked up 

Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up for me 

For me a nigga 



Verse 2 (Abel) 



They say that I was dealt some bad cards in this game of life 

But before I take my trip I'm gone leave with them stripes 

Sending dime bags of weed, toting nines til nose bleeds 

My nerve so bad I had to pop one of those be	's 

I had to strap my jimmy hat or catch this double mint disease 

See the devil in a crack pipe pointing at me 

I seen a nigga shaking just lke he caught the holy ghost 

But he really scored a gram of heroin for 80 bones 

I got them stones, if you take a hit you can't resist 

Now I'm crying, I think one of my brothers on that shit 

Do you care if you live or die, really I don't know 

But if there's hell below I think we all gonna go 



(Chorus) 



Verse 3 (Master P) 



Tell me is this heaven, is this hell 

I ain't LL, but all I hear is funeral bells 

The ghetto's trying to kill me, a born loser 

A born hustler my uncle's a drug user 

I'm from the projects or should I say the 3rd Ward 

Where fools into killing and fiends walk like androids 

Hooked up with the twins or should I say Kane & Abel 

Trying to keep some change in my pockets, some food on my table 



Verse 4 (Silkk) 



You know what P your right 

Cause Silkk was on the block like last night 

Niggaz doing anything from selling drugs 

to sell mugs smoking that glass pipe 

I'm from a messed up city where niggas don't live long 

they parents out-live they kids 

Rest in peace to my homie they like split his wig 

Now who won't walk that last mile to they death 

Imaging taking a deep (inhales) that was your last breath 

Just imaging your mom was prostituting your mom was smoking 

Imagine your eyes don't close imagine your eyes don't open 

I be like trying to keep the world and stay TRU 

There's too much drama in my hood, gotta stay cool 



Verse 5 (Master P) 



As I lay me down to sleep 

Black Jesus if you real, take me out this ghetto g 

Cause its crazy its wicked 

I got niggaz on every block trying to get a meal, ticket 

They killing they murder 

Little kids in 3 inch girdles 

And life is just like Pac Man 

Niggaz gumping up niggas but who gone be the next man 

To lose his shoes, I mean lose his life 

Who gone think twice, dying in this ghetto life 

Cause in the White House, politicians run the country 

But where I'm from in the ghetto's its bout drug money 

Ice cream slanging 

Niggas banging red and blue everybody's hanging 

Niggas bout it, little kids get rowdy 

But will I make it out this ghetto, I doubt it 



(Kane & Abel talking) 



I think the devil trying to get me to sell my soul 

He keep on walking with me, he keep on talking with me 

I think the devil's trying to get me to sell my soul 

He trying to temp me with the bitches and money

Than save me and my ghetto people",Black Jesus

Running through your click like busting on you like death wish
Spinning your head like the exorcist

Viscious, foaming at the mouth like rabies
Ain't no good cause in my hood we was doing bad like crack babies

Putting in work spitting game on your Boo

Taking everything you got with that infared dot on your knot
Down South Hustlers got on lock, with that J-L-O-see on cock

By the hands of that 4-4 (Clack Clack)
Pull the hammer back (That the last)
Live fast and watch them die slow
You know I really want to say is that they don't car about soldiers
Falling asleep behind the whell in the Range Rover
Can't remember the last time I was sober

Gotta watch those, 
The got some nerve talking bout the supposed to protect and serve
Took my money and my herb
Every player that on my team got a laser beam
Knock your head off, steal your dream
Not first you sure, ain't nutting nice serving fiends ain't what it seems
What the south about, big money, big guns and those big booties

Cause Choppers and street sweepers think murder peoples ass
You phony rappers talk about the game
Been there, done that

Turn you into fortune like Pat Sajak
Get down and dirty while you busters cleaner than Ajax

Kane & Abel,"[Kane]
See this here, this is somethin' serious right chea
I want all y'all ignorant niggas to listen to this
Not preachin' or teachin', but somethin' that y'all need to know

[Chorus]
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Whisper in my ear when my casket close
When it's my time to go, take my soul out the ghetto

[Kane]
Nowadays niggas kill, at the drop of a dime
There be wars and Pulitzer Awards in the last time
Killuminati comin', I read it in Revelations
A one world government, United Nations
Penetentaries like concentration camps
Visa Cards and food stamps turn the microchips in ya hand
I don't understand in this land I'm from
It's like the rich get richer, the poor fightin' for crumbs
We some killas of our own kind wit nines
The white man pimp us everyday and we don't mind
Crack kills the mind, but life kills the soul
And your time to go, is somthin' you can't control
The government designed a system, keep 'em mentally inslaved
Control the population, outbreak, and AIDS
The media keep niggas divided and confused
Poison us with the food, and give us drugs ta use
Keep you in the county, used niggas actin' like fools
Runnin' 'round like y'all ain't got nuthin' ta lose

[Chorus] x2

[Abel]
I know what you sayin' Kane

[Kane]
What?

[Abel]
Feel my pain
Test of time, put stress on the brain
I learnt ta do my hussle at the age of fourteen
How ta stack that triple beam, servin' stones ta fiends
And it was only for tha style, all I got ta slangin' dope
I was broke, ask my boy for weed
He said he only had coke
Ever since they been husslin', always went ta find a car
When I die put my name up on the wall
On my casket write, ""fuck all of y'all""
Remember Kane, those ladies used ta beat us, at tha foster home
Since the age of sixteen, we been livin' on our own
My momma pregnant wit us, shootin' up tha heroin
Nigga from ya zone, grab that dirty Chrome, it's on
Got two rocks left, prayin' that I make it home
Cause only God knows tha truth, only God knows

[Chorus] 'till fade",Only God Knows

Slim speaking on behalf of that wild magnolia 

My people gave me the low while I was doing time upstate 

Told me a nigga from downtown caught a little uptown fame 

That he ain't seen no real nigga yet 

But I bet he don't want no drama 

Laying with my people and don't give a fuck that somebody shot his shhh 

I only fuck bomb killers dope dealers and real niggas 

Ill niggas and trill niggas get it how they live niggas 

And they thought they roam uptown for the doo doo brown 

Better get face down on the ground when a nigga tie yo legs down 

See that's the heart of New Orleans 

Ask another nigga from another city about his 3rd 

I bet they tell you that the water quick reserve 

Leaving and stanking on the curve that's what they heard

Do this for the soldiers with the bourbons and lacs
High rollers smoke big weed burn cool by the pack
Watch your back New Orleans is a fool like that
Out the blue you crooked punishments choose to jack
You might see me on a cell fussing with my girl cussing
If you see me in the club it's only right we got to smoke something
Don't want to see me on the street busting like a mad russian
Banging niggas up like percussion need to turn it or crush em
Not for nothing ladies love it when twins be rapping
Taking titties out their bra they drop their g-string
Got our own company so come to us for the D
But that depend on how royal you want the hustle to be
It depend on how ployal you want the hummer to be
Don't trick give you the first hit for free
I know you missed us now we returned to the game
Still gangstafied bitch we invented that name
Ain't about to let no snake lay me out my chains
Cause i raised the stakes and put a stain on your grave
Underestimate here's the murder advice
A straight coward be the first one to take your life
Stop hating decide to get your own game tight
Cause i ride in the morning rather ride at night
Slide my flow get dough like Leo Dicaprio
Play your watch out gangster the rap Vito

If you can find danger after every step
Run a mile with death and see who win the fucking race

Got indicted on a case ain't stressing a bit
Boss Player pass the weed (Nigga hit this shit)
Bitch eliminate stress with sess get it off your chest
Take off your vest dance to the death
Spill blood for my beliefs cause that talk is cheap

Do you want to live or die
Break to the sky
You don't want this life

(Verse 1)
Still in the ghetto sit up in there a long time ago
But in my [?] it was the time to go
I got my hustle on in the street had to eat
Knew I was sinnin and I knew you will forgive me
I used to hang out with the thug figures drug dealers
So got love for my hook but you're my loves bigger
Stuck in the county jail pacin my cell
Facin 25 with a L million dollars bail
Thinkin 'what do I believe in, heaven or hell?'
Sometimes the street's stressed do my best but still fail
I grew up poor put in work and got rich
With you in my heart by my side I got some happiness
[?] your life get my life right
Because you're comin like a thief in the night
Dedicated to you for being there for me
Even though my life I do is so much tragedy

(Chorus) 2x

(Verse 2)
Did so much dirt in a world so cold
You took my mom and my dad when I was 6 years old
And everything I do I did it to get paid
In time I'm payin for those mistakes that I made
You called Clarence my boy we was in 11th grade
Preacher say you had a purpose for me -I stay
My grandmother told me that I ain't livin right
And my name gon be missin in heaven's book of life
The lady down the street say I'm goin to hell
With every day you let me live it's a story to tell
When my money was low and my hopes was high
I looked to the sky and you got me 'PA

(Chorus) 2x

(Verse 3)
Love you more than money in the bank much more than dank
Live without you I can't
I give you prayers and thanks
Ain't no killer in the ghetto better than you
Forever with you cause you're the most powerful
I ain't perfect never said I was perfect
But you put me through trails and my life
I know it's worth
Fell on my knees in the [?church?] prayin to you 
Don't got no gun in my waist I got respect for you
I got no fear cause the Lord you got my back
And we're livin in the final days of the last days
I believe that ain't no lookin back keep the contact
It's dedicated to you for being there for me

Is gonna make sure got harmed by no one, by no one

[Sundown]
So many snake ass niggas I come around with my trigger
And V and the Sundown, playboy how did ya figure
Ya supposed to be dog, do whatever fuck the stormy weather
If I had beef and you had beef we put the shit together

Which ever was clever, I spoiled to the depths
They wouldn't take yo breath
Without a retaliatin' rippin' someone's chest
Into the flesh, leavin' a bloody mess

Could ya picture bullets flyin', niggas dyin'
Families cryin' cause I thought this nigga was tryin' to take mine
Shit gets better and you can imagine
I got mad love for ya but it ain't that kind of passion

It's the kind where .357 be blastin'
Niggas be duckin' and passin'
Behind the ones I love so much, shit gettin' drastic
I can't have it like I can't have it

Behind my back runnin' ya mouth like that
Get cha' shit straight to the fact
Let's see what the fuck possessin' you to think like that
And where the courage came from for you to pull off that act

[Kane & Abel]
I was brought up by snakes, taught me to survive in the grass
Use one eye to watch your friend the other watch your ass
Let no man be excused from suspicion when something missin'

Listen to his story but when he guilty become victim
Quick descions get cha' post cut short
Get cha' filled with cha' mind, keep it with much heart
Business is yankin'

Fuck with strays and ya family, friends
And money mix like mayonaise and cotton candy
Strangely the roots of all evil
Could easily be the fruits for all people

Anything with a life got a price
If it can't be bought, it can be knocked off for a pair of Nikes
Tight as times is ya mind is ya weapon
Keep it when ya steppin' use it when ya threatened

A blessing from God can never be taken
By the hands of a man who can never understand
You sucker ass snakes

Somebody gotta pay, I been on this block all day
Tryin' to get off all this yay

[Verse 1]
I'm the boardman bitch but let me tell ya how I came up
Cooked a lot of that raw, never sold that fake stuff
Cutthroat cha' if ya try to bring me some harm
Don't look at me wrong cause I'll be bustin' ya long
Blunbt smoke with the rocks in my mouth, see all dirty
Gotta see my P.O. tomorrow on a hot Thursday
But today I'ma make it bump around the way
I lay K off in the grass so ya better not play
If ya just jumped off the porch I'ma slam ya
If ya talkin' crazy nigga I'ma have to handle ya
If it's real I can serve ya, we can do a little business
Keep it on the low when we straight I'ma hit chu' with that issue
As long as I got narcotics make me richer
Before I stop I'ma blow up the block this year

Fuckin' with me and my loot then it's gonna be a murder
I creep in ya house like a burglar
Do you really think it's a game, you lame
When bullets flame you gon' be the next nigga unnamed
What cha' heard, my click can't be flamed, crazy in the brain
Yes we do get into this hustle so don't fuck with out brains
On the block is where I hang
In the same fit for three weeks
For this goof that steal my money race like a track meet
On a Friday ain't no heat, only if you got beef
It's about to be a X for nigga tryin' to hit a ho with that bare meat
In the streets it's known that we got em' anything can happen
I'ma make it so the crack and rap and hustlin' is happenin'

[Verse 3]
I jumped off in tha game back in 96
Nigga hit me three bricks, nigga post that list
Servin' Boxcar Ramone, that nigga was kissed
I used to give him two stones just to test my shit
Got my first piece of pussy in a project hallway
Pussy to the gun play, we can play all day
Smokin' big weed, keep my conscience clear
P.O. bitch touched me now I'm back on a tear
I can't wait to see them niggas when they see my face
Give my lawyers six figures now they droppin' the case
When I was small big niggas on the block would ball
I had to look up to em' like they was 20 feet tall
Fuck y'all I'm stack my tips, take these hits
Fuck a thick bitch in a brand new six
Now it's Friday, like a ho to do it my way
Only do the speed limit and a third on the highway

When it defies
And the opiate is spiteful

And your ravaged torso

And complete the stunning response to the spite

As he burns at your feet
And then you spill your guys

It's like a kiss, kiss on the forehead
And it's how you kiss them
That just cracks my skin through
It's time to steal another kiss from your broad shoulders

It's time you lick my heart
And burn my eyes with your hip acid filled caress
You keep the endings coming
And I'll keep the vomit flowing

Your mating calls are showing
That the best thing in life aren't worth loving
What if I lined my lips with your poison then you'd better kiss me
You'd better make me give in, make me your everything

What an index that could make for
What your body is scarred from, the bombs on the first floor

We'll blame it on the housing projects

And I want to live forever

Shake your thorax to the footsteps

They'd love to dream of blackmail
They'd love to bathe you in your former glory

Next stop, faith in the fact that
You'll have the answer to everything
Faster, faster, won't you make it
Faster one more time?

To breathe your breath in time
Your breath is out of time, make it faster
Now shake your hips with culture
Now point your fingers to the sky

Save your ritual tragedy, it's time to celebrate our new
Noble complacent so lucid serenity
Take it from here and I'll save our eyes
With your forked tongue, living like a fascist lover

Kane's River,"Back in 1860 when the buffalo still ran
Annie met a man who talked of 
Living off the land
She can't believe that years ago 
At wild-eyed 16
They hit the rutted wagon trail 
West with just a dream

After months of travel 
With the other pioneers
Miles from the Rockies they just stopped 
And dropped their gear
Looking back the summer grass was 
Green as green can get
They settled in a good year, 
It'll be a dozen 'til the next

Now she knows there's 
A love off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

Summer killed the crops 
Beneath the brutal August sun
Cattle starved to nothing 
Found the mercy of a gun
Love had warmed the cabin when 
The nights were 10 below
Bitter words and hatred now 
Are all that they can grow

Now she knows there's a love 
Off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come w
Wen the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

Desperate times and drought years 
Can destroy the best of men
She can't help but wonder 
If he'll ever love again
Her dreams have turned to nightmares 
And they're all about the rain
Now she thinks of as just 
A thousand acre pain

Now she knows there's a love 
Off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm",Calm Before the Storm
Kane's River,"It's the 13th of November 
And I cross another day off the calendar 
That hangs there by the door
A silent witness to the lonely life 
That I have made 
Where every passing hour 
Is just like the one before
When love is new it shines 
Like sparkling diamonds 
In the sun, like morning dew 
Upon the leaves of gold
But if it is neglected it will slowly fade away 
And leave you there with nothing but a heart 
That's sad and cold

I know that you are gone 
Because of things I didn't do
You left because of things I didn't say
The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame 
For sending all my bridges up in flames
There's nothing left to do but pray for rain

At first I didn't realize just how far 
We'd grown apart, our sunny skies 
Reduced to shades of gray
I thought that I was falling 
Out of love with you 
And so, I heard but didn't listen to 
The things you had to say
But no man is an island, 
Or so the saying goes, 
And a house that has no love is not a home
Life without you has got to be 
The hardest thing I've done, 
And if you can forgive me 
We won't have to be alone

I know that you are gone 
Because of things I didn't do
You left because of things I didn't say
The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame 
For sending all my bridges up in flames
There's nothing left to do but pray for rain

The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame
Nothing left to do but pray for rain",Pray for Rain
Kane's River,"I remember the face of an angel, 
A love that was faithful and true
I left that dear girl in the mountains, 
For a ramblin' life empty and blue

Sweet roses bloom where they're planted, 
Wild flowers seed on the wind
That valley was closer to heaven, 
Than any place this poor fool's been

It's a far cry from here to Virginia
But I've crawled every inch of that ground
My teardrops fall like rain on the roof
Of that blueridge home where I'm bound

This old highway is a ribbon of lonesome, 
I don't care where I lay my head down
Virginia has died broken-hearted, 
My poor mountain darlin' is gone

But I've crawled every inch of that ground

Kano,"Seriously man,
Like, you know when you got a good girl,
Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name. 

Here we go again
Here we go

Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her ""ladybird"",
Cos she always played red, in connect four. 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

Look, 
I call her nite nite
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, my favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
""I'm way too tired"", my favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right? 

Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you. 

So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,
We speak from like 8 till late at night,
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line:

Girl, I ain't going nowhere. 

I plain ain't going nowhere,
But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like

Here we go again,

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: ""no drama"", I don't need beef like (? )
I'm just focused on making the peas, breaking the team, chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me. 
You? you got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't ""sort-of"", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me? 
Treat me massage me and make me a tea? 
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees? 

And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? that's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me? 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's ""long baby"", cos you always on my mind, yeah. 
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,
No, no, I know, no, I know, oh
Yeah I like you,

Here we go again,

Kano,"It's just one of those days
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days 
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
And now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep 
It's just typical me 
I must have one of them faces
Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

Innit
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just typical me 

I must just be unruly
So no-one call over Rudy 
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

It's always Kano getting in the madness
Me I'm in the corner sippin' on Champers 
But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss
That's what you're doing
I'll try my best to not be aggressive

For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing keeps me together

But ain't no rave better than the old raves,
Shut champagne and the low fade,
Skank out heartless I'm old school,
Love bug burden over you, it's overdue,
No hype no fighting over tunes,
Ten guys on the mic all over you,
No ravers just some rude girls,
They don't make them like they used to.

Kano,"There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

True, you can move food on the street
Did a bitta that, got bored of that
Didn't move the brown or the crack
Use to pick up for the fact
I could make more back by breaking down to scores n that
Stack to buy out the stores n that
Didn't give a shit about loads of that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you ain't so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
Coz where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
Fuck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Look I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyle's too much
If I bust, be proud of me
You can't take it out of me
So I'm a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
I'm still about, I'm home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out
I'm too bad

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

Look, you can do moves on the street
Id rather spit bars on the beat
Id rather that than nick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So I'm solo like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I ain't on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he bust K's
That undergrounds like roll this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But I'm strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can I'm a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I ain't through man
I'm'a ball through like a cue dan
Watch me, ain't gonna let no-one stop me
UK I'm gonna break you properly
And If you ain't gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A â?¦ I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute
And next minute you're gone away

I fear my safety, I fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still gon' blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Right, night, record then start to write okay
But I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only I'm to blame
Today I saw the signs that came, and it's got a good look
But that's life they say, crime pays
And Ill stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime ain't making me mill's
So I'm picking up a 9 today
And spittin' ain't getting me deals
But this shits just getting real

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
The next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

There are lots of sugns in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute
And next minute your gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by worst, you will get paid



",Signs in Life
Kano,"Yo, yo yo yo yo
When I see the fans go mad I think why do they like me?
There's about a thousand other boys just like me
Spittin' lyrics on the mic dressed in Nike
What makes me so special?
When they say I'm the next one to blow 
I say why do they think me?
All I do is stay in mostly and sleep 
And all I do is watch channel you and drink tea, why me?
All I do is listen to myself and get my lyrics in order
Play my own songs and give a mirror performance
Now I'm about to sign I'm sort of in there with warmers
I'm movin' on now, wish me good luck
My manager said this the quickest deal ever
I said 18 years ain't the quickest deal ever
I'm tryin' 2 sell and make the quickest meal ever
Support my family so I can feel better
But its not for the cheddar,
Its not for the fame
Its not for the rolex 
Its not for the chain
Its just for the respect, I've been doin' this for years remember
Free of charge I ain't rich yet

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a popstar I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Finkin' could be underground goin' mainstream
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Finkin' could be underground goin' mainstream

Its so real now, I've had dreams of this album
So reality is the theme of this album
Boy I dunno if ill make cream off this album
I just wanna see fans screamin' and shoutin'
I ain't doubting my ability but sometimes I think why me particularly
What different have I got to offer lyrically?
But maybe there is something about me that the worlds dying to see
And without me, who can replace me a few can amaze me
And literally do what I do to the rave scene 
And go from spittin' in the booth to the mainstream
But am I gifted? Maybe I am
18 I'm only a baby I am they say
But was I born to do this ? yes
I don't have to sign no forms to do this but
I just take it one step at a time
One word at a time
One stage at a time
One breath at a time
Until I run out of time.

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a popstar I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Finkin' could be underground goin' mainstream

Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick

I drink too much when I was forty

Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique

I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick

I try my best to not be aggressive but

It's always Kano getting in the madness

But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss

If being fatherless
Means no gift under trees, fuck it and plant the shit
Still got a tick on my feet, mothers are hustlers
But pushing little sis on the swing's a box I'd rather tick
Ramping with my niece
Makes me think about the sis that I never see
'Member the day you was introduced to me and Lee
You won't remember it, you was only two or three
You had your hair in twists, pretty little sunshine
Dropped you off just one time
Then we didn't ever see you again, was it the Choc Ice?
But maybe Dad's no longer with Mum, Jamaican bloodline
But I feel responsible 'cause I could've reached out just one time
Now I wonder if you know who I am
I wonder if you tell your friends that we're fam
I wonder if you're listening to this
Even though you must've grown all big

This one's for my little sis
This one's for my little sis

So many landmarks missed
13, 16, 18, landmarks missed
For all I know, you've got a kid that Uncle Kane can't gift
Tiny baby Stan Smiths, ah, now they match my creps
You could all be married now and I didn't give no speech
No, not that speech, the De Niro speech
You know where the groom goes in a headlock in the hotel suite?
You're in the circle of trust, best treat she like queen
Family trees and olive branches
Or maybe we'll next meet when Daddy passes
See you there
I'll be in my funeral suit and Jeffery West
But maybe you've been thinking for years to send a text
But I get if you don't wanna come across like you're begging friend
Some girl rolled up to me at Lovebox, said she knows my sis
I said ""nah, love, I ain't got no-"" shit, how could I forget little sis?

East Ham, Plaistow, with Maxwell Leyton dreams
You were one of the first to make me believe in my first 16s
But did the heights I reached jeopardise the dial and speak
But we go back since manor and ride-on-the-play scheme
District coach, one Walkman, one ear each
Napier Road, Black Pitch
One-day travel cards and Fat Chaps chips
We toured the country, took it overseas
Took it from the streets to The Streets
And if someone was in your ear
Just know my intentions was clear
I was helping us all, we
I made sure we was all there
It's kind of hard when you're the face of it
Was you jealous of my fame a bit?
Funny thing is, I don't even want these questions answered
I just wanna have a brandy and a laugh regardless
Instead of acting like we're strangers, yeah

Seven years ago was Shane's little one's christening
AB was there tryna put to bed all the bickering
He made a phone call to you in the toilets
Said ""someone wants to speak"", gave me the phone to my annoyance
I said ""hello?"", you must've heard my voice and hung up
I just heard the phone cut out and picked my rum up
And hit the dancefloor to some Mavado, finger gun up
Water off a duck's back, but truth be told, that hurt, my brother
What dem a do? What dem a try?
To make our friendship fly into the sky
I said in ""Celebrate"" that I ain't even met your kids
A falling out has made us look a fool for this
I can't pinpoint where the problem started at
Who's to blame or who should even claim half of that
If it's stubborn competition, we both win
So who would just pick up the phone?
Could even if we grew apart, we're still a partnership
So why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?
Oh boy, we ain't strangers

I wrote those first two verses last year, last year
Then the other day, was raving in west end and I see you there
I see you there, bredrin, I see you there, yeah
And we didn't have that brandy but we laughed
Plus we drank some vodka and a half
Oi, if you're hugging mate but wearing all-black, is that still gangster?
Gangster or not, that's my damn darg
And things were back to normal for one night, that's enough
Just to let us know there's no grudge, it's all love
But we all carry scars, we're all cut, we're grown ups
Teenage no more, we're older, we've grown up
But the next day got me thinking what if I was the reason?
Or if the tables turned, whether I would be seated
Or if your battery died that night at that christening
And I thought you disrespected, what if it was just reception?
So the straw that broke the camel's back of this friendship
Maybe it wasn't the intention, but would symbolise the ending
Now, what if you thought I hung up
And for seven years, you've been hung up on the same shit that I was
I guess we'll never know, it's pointless digging deeper holes
Cause if we go down that road, these burnt bridges charge tolls
So I'd rather bromanticise about these things
And write a song about what-ifs, cause I could never write no diss
Cause that's my brother
That's my brother
So bruv, why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?

Can I have time? Is it right what I feel?
At times I doubt what I normally know is real
But right now I don't know what to do
And it's all because of you
I could tell you if I knew that you'd believe

As slight and elusive as life sometimes is
Right or wrong as we both know we all can be
I could never have denied that I need you by my side
'Cause without you life don't seem that much to me

I can see an old man cry, it's his time to die
And life no longer gives him any breaks
He hasn't got a home, no one to call his own
Still he tells no one that it is more than he can take

When the time is so unkind, an empty future plays in your mind
When the darkness cries out to you, can you escape it?
What can you do?

All the world's forgetting the hate that filled our hearts
The times of selfish reasoning that keeps all apart
This world was meant to share, let them know you care

Unheard it always will remain
Beyond our reach, beyond our gain

Trapped in life's parade, a king without a crown
In this joy of madness, my smile might seem a frown
With talons wrought of steel, I tore the heart of doom

The slumber of the earth is pure and deep
From a distant wood, drifts the echo of a beast
The old man stirs and wakens in the night
He stands before his window gazing at the grave
Forgotten dreams are flashing through his weary mind
And though his life is empty, he pretends that she's still there

With hunger in his soul, he yearns for life and love gone by,
With memories his one and only joy
All he has to give, he would give to bring back the life,
And raise the one who lies beneath the snow
He lights a lamp and looks at pictures of the past
The faces of their youth still glow with new-found love,
But the picture's faded, and time has stolen youth away

With a spoken word that he thought he heard from her lips,
He felt another presence in the room,
He was filled with fear but filled with joy he arose
And turned to face the image that he knew
She stood before him and her hand reached out for his
A peaceful light shone in her eyes
She said she'd come to soothe him, and someday they'd be as one

She began to fade and her image disappeared,
So he was left alone to face the night,
Never in his life, had he been so held in awe,
As he faced the apparition of his wife
He stood before the window gazing at the grave,
And with a lightened heart he saw the first of dawn,
He knew that she was waiting, that someday they'd be as one",Lamplight Symphony

Kansas,"Once carried through the current, and being swept away
The king is in his closet, he's hiding from today
And though he owns all fortunes, this room is where he'll stay
And his world is filled with darkness, turning grey

Gazing out the window of the forty-second floor
He is separate from all others, no one knocks upon his door
And it might as well be raining, 'cause the sunlight hurts his eyes
And his ears will never hear the children's cries

Once proud and full of passion, he fought the cause of man
Many people loved his courage, many followed his command
He changed the old into the new, and the course of things to come
And then one day they noticed he was gone

At first it didn't matter, nobody seemed to care
They all became too busy to find him anywhere
But no one knew not even him, the problems he would find
On the day he journeyed deep into his mind

I close my eyes, I go far away
Away from this battlefield
In my dreams, well
Here I will enjoy it
Where innocence plays with all
The laughing children
The kind who are crying right now

A taste of freedom from the pain
Of everything here I see
Life is sweet but I took it all for granted
And now I don't know if I could even tell you
Just what we permit, we allow

Allow me to forget the life I've made my own
I've held this nation in my hand, and yet it's not my home
Oh, allow me just one answer, and one reason why
Why this refugee of the family of man must die
Tell me why

Confusion and uncertainty, a puzzled mind of haze
You thought he was so powerful, and set upon his ways

Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

Blood in the sand, a cry in the street
Now the cycle is nearly complete
Ten thousand years, and nothing was learned
No turning back, now the wheel has turned

Big Brother is watching and he likes what he sees
A world for the taking, when he's ready to squeeze
The King and the Queen are gone, each piece is the same
The difference between us is a part of the game

Soothsayer saying now tell me no lies
What is this madness that is filling the skies
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain
",Sparks of the Tempest
Kansas,"He had a thousand ideas, you might have heard his name
He lived alone with his vision
Not looking for fortune or fame
Never said too much to speak of
He was off on another plane
The words that he said were a mystery
Nobody's sure he was sane

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view, Oh where was he going to

He was in search of an answer
The nature of what we are
He was trying to do it a new way
He was bright as a star
But nobody understood him
""His numbers are not the way""
He's lost in the deepest enigma
Which no one's unraveled today

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view, Oh where was he going to
And he tried, but before he could tell us he died
When he left us the people cried,
Oh where was he going to?

He had a different idea
A glimpse of the master plan
He could see into the future
A true visionary man
But there's something he never told us
It died when he went away
If only he could have been with us
No telling what he might say

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view
Oh, where was he going to
But he knew, you could tell by the picture he drew
It was totally something new,
Oh where was he going to?

",The Spider
Kansas,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
The wind",Dust in the Wind [Acoustic Guitar Solo]
Kansas,"Angels have fallen, fallen from heaven, where did they go
No one could save them no one forgave them their chance to know
When I hear them below I think how it is to be weary
Children are restless they know what can happen when men are vain
Talking in riddles won't keep them from knowing you've gone insane
They know a few will try to gain by trying to live like their teachers

Save me for now, save me forever
Hold me so close, I can't bear to go
There's darkness around me or is it within me
You're living forever, I'm dying so slow
Inside a window that leads to your conscience you'll see, you'll hear
People are talking maybe you know them, they know you're near
Masking themselves from fear and asking themselves who their friends are

Well you say that you've been here in this life and time
You say it's no good here, but you say that so fine
You reach for your winnings, an angelic excuse
Round them you act humble, still you never refuse
You better tell all your people to watch for a sign
Make them glad they are living in this life and time
The angels have fallen, they've all gone away
It's you that must find them by living each day",Angels Have Fallen
Kansas,"Used to think about what I would grow up to be
Good or bad, right or wrong, it was no harm to me
Was a time in my life when I wish I'd have known
You can't gamble with fate, you might end up alone
Meet me where the feeling is high, let the sound surround you
Meet me at the top of the sky, where the colors fly around you
Well, I'm lost in a world of dismay
But nothin' can take me away from you
Left you back while I worked very hard to succeed
All the distance I've gone makes it hard to believe
You and I were so close, now we're so far apart
And I remember the feeling we shared in our heart
Again and again you return to haunt me in my dreams
See your eyes, how they glisten, your hair how it gleams
And I know I will miss you when you have to go
I return to my place until nights lets me know",Away from You
Kansas,"The night was cold, was deja vu
I went on thinking we were too
How my soul cries out for you
To many places we once knew
To many faces, still no clue
How my soul cries out for you
I didn't think I needed you when I got out on my own
Dead set on having my way I was convinced that
I was right and you were wrong
Then I started thinkin' to myself
Well maybe what they say is true
How could we get so turned around when you needed me
As much as I needed you...
I tried to get you on the phone
No one answered, no one answered at home
I heard that you thought we were through
Somethin' I had, somethin' I had to do and
How my soul cries for you
How my soul cries out for you
It cries for love that we once knew
How my soul cries out for you",How My Soul Cries Out for You
Kansas,"So long, someone is waiting
I got places to go, I got things to see
No more procrastinating
For this is the moment that was meant for me
And I'm moving like a wave on the ocean
Drifting to the opposite ride
Traveling with no destination
Just riding the tide

People they say that I'm foolish
They say that I'm living in a fantasy
I say, everything's easy
It's better than living in futility
So, I'm standing here in back of the curtain
Waiting for the start of the show
Acting like an actor is easy
If you can let go

Someday something will find you
A magical feeling you could not foresee
A feeling so devastating
From that moment on your life's a comedy
And suddenly you're light as a feather
You're falling like a leaf from a tree
The things you thought you needed are fading
Your reason to be

Kansas,"I still believe in what you say
I still believe that it could work ok

You'll never change your mind
You exist so free and clear
Let no one touch you let no one near
I think you're just someone afraid of fear
Or what you just might find
I can see them all lining up outside your front door
Filthy minds and terrible habits are interesting

Sure
O but look at me now if I've changed tell me how
O I'd do anything for you

I'm sick of fighting but I need you so
You tell me lies but I can't let go
I want to take you out but you say no
Think you're ashamed of me
You give me headaches o you got your gall
If it weren't for me you wouldn't have nuttin' at all
I fell for you 'caus you were nice and tall
I liked what I could see
I could be the keeper of fortunes if I was inclined
Let me know that you're standing beside me I'll give them a sign

Kansas,"As I look out in the night
And count the stars all shining bright
I wonder where I am and where I'm going
Sometimes I think I've lived before
I seem to see beyond a door
But it's just a crazy notion I leave showing
I live my life as sensitive as possible then one day
Maybe I'll wake up young again
With feelings of a new day
But what we feel I know we'll, miss
And someday I'll look back at this
And know by then the life that we were meant for, but are you leaving
Leaving my back door

You want the world to give you some
You fight a war that's never won and you
Come back scarred 'cause you've seen who's really dying
You reach a point where nothing lasts
You play a part that someone casts you into
Now their machines keep right on lying
I want the world to be a place where no one comes to suffer
Just give the pain an empty place
Away from one another
Let's seal our words with a kiss
'cause someday we'll look back at this
We'll know by then the life that we were meant for, but are you leaving
Leaving by my back door",Back Door
Kansas,"The streets of the city are barren
All the windows and doors have been closed
As the night draws near
You can feel their fear
Their freedom is just an illusion
And they tell us that love is a lie
Can it all be true
What can one man do

[Chorus]
See the pages as they turn
Never will the children learn
Born as a prisoner in a curtain of iron
Never will the pages turn

The City of Gold's in the distance
And they've already forgotten their dream
Visions slowly fade
In this land of shade

[Chorus]

As the power grows, darkness spreading
Hope is still alive, though we're dreading
What the future holds, no more need to
Fear what all men face
Only good can win the race

Rumors speak of war, all the nations
Turmoil in the streets, tribulations
Now it's plain to see
All the prophecies are taking place
Only good can win the race

There are fragments of truth still remaining
And they bring them the light of the world
To this hope we cling
Till the bells will ring

See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn
Our bloody history soon will resolve
See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn
Free from the prison, a Curtain of Iron",Curtain of Iron
Kansas,"Who sees you when you're sleeping?
Who knows the thoughts you're keeping?

You're reaching out your hand 'cause someone's calling.
Don't open your eyes too soon, 'cause it might be me.

Faces all around say you're forsaken.
You see yourself and someone else behind you.
Don't open your eyes too soon, it might not be me.

That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

Can't think straight can't think at all staring out the window

Kansas,"Centuries of backward ways, have many left behind us
Who can count the good men gone away
The fruits of all our labors have left us as we started
We've come too far to end it in a day
It seems that everything we do is wrong
A one way trip to nowhere all along
Just look around and tell me what you see
Another stupid page of history

No one together, No one is touching ground
Look at each other, Chaos is all around
Same situation, Nothing is really new
No one together, No one is me and you

Lo the horn of plenty is bursting at the seam
The harvest of the world will be our prize
We claim to know the secrets, the answers have been found
But how can one fool make another wise
'Cause nothing's better than it used to be
To live and die is still a mystery
We take away and we give nothing back
We just consume it all and still we lack

No one together, No one is touching ground
Look at each other, Chaos is all around
Same situation, Nothing is really new
No one together, No one is me and you

Each day passed by so quickly now
You can feel it drawing much closer now
The signs are in the faces of the people in the street
The signs are in the sound I hear
The voices filled with hate and fear
You can feel it drawing near you now

The multitudes are searching, and wandering in vain
For what they seek cannot be found in men
The truth that lies before us now is plain for all to see
To grow without is not to grow within
For in the promise is a victory
To see the way that everything should be
To feel the joy that we were meant to know
We should have realized so long ago

We're all together, Harmony will abound'

New situation if our direction's true

And raise the one who lies beneath the snow
He lights a lamp and looks at pictures of the past
The faces of their youth still glow with new-found love,
But the picture's faded, and time has stolen youth away

With a spoken word that he thought he heard from her lips,
He felt another presence in the room,
He was filled with fear but filled with joy he arose
And turned to face the image that he knew
She stood before him and her hand reached out for his
A peaceful light shone in her eyes
She said she'd come to soothe him, and someday they'd be as one

She began to fade and her image disappeared,
So he was left alone to face the night,
Never in his life, had he been so held in awe,
As he faced the apparition of his wife
He stood before the window gazing at the grave,
And with a lightened heart he saw the first of dawn,
He knew that she was waiting, that someday they'd be as one",Lonely Street [*]

I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man

The beauty she once knew has come and gone
We've murdered all her sons and all her daughters
The blood is on your hands, the time has come
And now she's gonna die

We've strangled all her trees and starved her creatures
There's poison in the sea and in the air
But worst of all we've learned to live without her
We've lost the very meaning of our lives
And now she's gonna die

Once she ruled the earth with love and wisdom
But we were much too smart to live her way
With greed and lust we tried to rise above her

Kansas,"I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall,
So many men have drowned in evil, and left Lucifer standing tall
Don't take the devil's dare, don't gamble when the game ain't fair,
Lock and bolt the doors, can't let the devil use you anymore

You got to listen all you mugs and reivers, if you do any wrong
You make it right
You can't be a make-believer, 'cause soon you're gonna pay the price,
Lying, hat and pain, all part of the devil game,
Got his foot inside the door, but you can't let him use you anymore

Take, he will take, he will take, give him nothing he'll take, he will take
He will take, he will give nothing but he'll take

Pray, for devils have no reason, Satan waits to curse your ways,
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset,
Have you wondered if he's laughing when you play,
Has he asked if you're alone if what he sees is all you own,
Has he offered you happiness, money, or much better lays
Satan leave me, leave me lonely, leave us alone

I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall,
Take a look at what the future's holdin',
Won't be yours if you don't heed this call,

So much wasted time on an uphill climb
But you where always there, a feeling in the air
There was nothing to fear you were so near
Now you are here once again
As I stand in your presence
I can feel the quiet patience of your gaze
Like an old superstition
You are haunting all my dreams and waking days

All my life I knew you were waiting, revelation anticipating
All is well, the search is over, let the truth be known
Let it be shown (give me a glimpse of home)
There's no resisting you among the chosen few
It's hard to be sure, it's hard to endure
And when I hear your voice
I know I have the choice
To pursue an ideal, something so real
Now I've got nothing to lose
As I see your reflection
All the answers I desire become so clear
Like a page that is turning
I can look into the future without fear
You're in my rock and roll, you're in my very soul
Though it's heavy to bear, it's a feeling so rare
And it's a mystery, the way it's meant to be
Can we ever know, we're moving so slow
There ain't enough time in the world
As I reach up the ladder
There is something ever higher to perceive
Like a fire that is burning
In my heart I know I surely must believe",A Glimpse of Home

Drew them apart
Both knew that deep within his heart they must part

Can it be, my memory has torn my life in two

Shooting stars how they seem so close

The Sky Is Falling

The lottery winner thinks forever
Is something she can buy
All the pictures on the wall
Are hanging high so they won't fall
Until her tear stained floor is dry

The pool shark's life is stranger than fiction
But today's his lucky day
He bets it all on a final game
But then he chokes ain't that a shame
The 8 ball had one last thing to say

Just stop the sky from falling
Falling down on me
Stray cats are creepy calling
Hound dog harmony
Just stop the sky from falling
Dodge the buck shot rain
This tree house free for all
The sky is falling
Who's got a crane

Jazz singer padlocks all his memories
Long nights have left their mark
His lava lamp condition
His black light intuition
How come tomorrow seams so dark?

Kansas,"He had a thousand ideas, you might have heard his name
He lived alone with his vision
Not looking for fortune or fame
Never said too much to speak of
He was off on another plane
The words that he said were a mystery
Nobody's sure he was sane

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view, Oh where was he going to

He was in search of an answer
The nature of what we are
He was trying to do it a new way
He was bright as a star
But nobody understood him
""His numbers are not the way""
He's lost in the deepest enigma
Which no one's unraveled today

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view, Oh where was he going to
And he tried, but before he could tell us he died
When he left us the people cried,
Oh where was he going to?

He had a different idea
A glimpse of the master plan
He could see into the future
A true visionary man
But there's something he never told us
It died when he went away
If only he could have been with us
No telling what he might say

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view
Oh, where was he going to
But he knew, you could tell by the picture he drew
It was totally something new,
Oh where was he going to? ",Portrait
Kansas,"I heard the men saying something
The captains tell they pay you well
And they say they need sailing men to
Show the way and leave today

They say the sea turns so dark that
You know it's time, you see the sign
They say the point demons guard is
An ocean grave for all the brave
Was it you that said, ""How long, how long
How long to the point of know return?""

Your father, he said he needs you
Your mother, she said she loves you
Your brothers, they echo the words
""How far to the point of know return?""
""Well, how long?""

Kansas,"Virgin land of forest green, dark and stormy plains, here all life abounds
Sunlit valley, mountain fields, unseen in the rain, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in Earth's delights

Painted desert, sequined sky, stars that fill the night, here all life abounds
Rivers flowing to the sea, sunshine pure and bright, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in Earth's delights

So the maiden lies in waiting for the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abunance, innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure, full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure

Across the sea there came a multitude, sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia and the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder, rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under

Highways scar the mountainsides, buildings to the sky, people all around
So we rule this land, and her we stand upon our paradise
Dreaming of a place, our weary race is ready to rise",Song for America [*]

Que me siento
En el parque aquel
Me distrae ver los niños
Tomando una taza de cafe
Algunos les dan comida a las palomas
Otros solo les columpian largas horas
Otros solo estaran aqui de paso y nada mas
Hoy si no veo mal
Hay alguien que hace dia ya no esta

A donde fue Cecilia?
Ya no la veo en el parque aquel

Siempre te guardaba una sonrisa

No la veo desde aquel atardecer
Dicen que le compraron un helado
Y en secreto debio haberselo ganado
Entregando sus manitas y sus piel
Siendo mas lo que le han robado

A donde fue Cecilia?
A donde fue tu niña
Hoy con alma de mujer
Uh, uh

Hace ya unas semanas que me siento
Solamente a ver si es que con toda su gracia
Se volviese a aparecer y no puedo pensar
Que a sus siete años alguien podria desear
Hacerle daño y que anda por las calles
De encubierto sin saber que le roba la inocencia
Descargando su violencia

Quiero darte la explicacion:

Que fui a una tienda
Que lo que he comprado

Mejor que tus besos why que tus abrazos

Pues no me hacen falta ya mas tus engaños
Para dar migajas why hacerme mas daño
Mejor soy feliz

Otros le llaman amigo

No me hubiese interesado

Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor

No veo nada contigo para escapar

Hoy me miro y me encuentro aquí viviendo el instante
Voy recolectando todo, cada día mas

Y se que cuando, no estas, mes dura el tiempo
No se que hacerme con toda esta soledad

Cuando tu no estas, se queda aun lado mi egoísmo
Pensando en ti, sabiendo que esto sera eterno

Hoy te encuentro esperando allí, con los brazos abiertos
Guardo entre mis manos, caricias con tu nombre envuelto

Si te miro, siento que eres todo, siento que conecto
Eres el milagro, mi hogar predilecto

Y cuando tu no estas, mes dura el tiempo
No se que hacerme con toda esta soledad

Y cuando tu no estas, se queda aun lado mi egoísmo
Pensando en ti, sabiendo que esto sera eterno

Dame alguna idea, donde pueda encontar felicidad
Como la que me das con solo amarme
Con tu mirada puedo continuar

Dame en este sueño, alguna razón para despertar
Yo me quedo contigo, solo contigo

Cuando tu no estas, mes dura el tiempo
No se que hacerme con toda esta soledad

Cuando tu no estas, se queda aun lado mi egoísmo pensando en ti
Sabiendo que esto sera eterno

Cuando tu no estas, mes dura el tiempo
No se que hacerme con toda esta soledad

Cuando tu no estas, se queda aun lado mi egoísmo pensando en ti
Sabiendo que esto sera eterno sera eterno",Cuando Tú No Estás
Kany García,"Tanto, yo espere tanto
Tanto pa olvidarte, pa sentir
Que ya no te pensaba mas
Quize, dibujar mi mundo
Le quité ventanas, puertas y
Así tu recuerdo no me quitaría la paz

Luego de intentarlo tanto
De prometer olvidarte
Luego de cerrar la puerta
Hoy regresas a buscarme

Dime la verdad, dime si te quedarás
No me digas que me quede no no
Y mañana que mas da
Dime la verdad pues no caminaré de más
Luego de abrirte todo el mundo
Yo caiga en un impulso
Dime solo tu verdad y nada mas

Cuándo? A veces pienso cuándo?
Cuando volverás a destrozarme el corazón
Cuando es que te malcharás?

Ando, con miedo de entregarme
Con miedo en repetirte las palabras
Que a ciega te entregué de más

Tú me pidas q confie
Vete y dícelo a mi alma
Dejo que el tiempo me guie
Pero no prometo nada

Dime la verdad, dime si te quedarás
No me digas que me quede no no
Y mañana que mas da
Dime la verdad pues no caminare de mas
Luego de abrirte todo el mundo
Yo caiga en un impulso
Dime solo tu verdad y nada más

Si es que camino con calma
No me tengas prisa voy dando de poco
Pero en mi sonrisa demuestro
Que quiero darme para siempre
Si es que se me escapa el llanto
Si me ves ausente entiende que
Un día digiste detente
A lo que existiía entre tu y yo
Y yo

Dime la verdad, dime si te quedarás
No me digas que me quede no no
Y mañana que mas da
Dime la verdad pues no caminaré de mas
Luego de abrirte todo el mundo

Dime solo tu verdad
Dime solo solo tu verdad y nada mas
Yo no quiero nada mas",Dime la Verdad

Kany García,"Fue tan real
Fue casi el abismo pude caer
Cambiar mi destino
Jugarme las cartas, caer en tu embrujo
Pensar que pudimos ser uno

Pude un dia leerte la mirada
Y detras de los disfrazes encontraba alli tu alma
Esperando algun te quiero mendigando una caricia
Deceando ser la vida de mi vida
Y quise creer

Esta vida tuya y mia
Fue tan perfecta en este cuento en mi cabeza
Pensado de capaz de tener fuerza
Para salir de donde estabas
Y mostrar por fin tus alas

Esta vida tuya y mia
Ha sido clara del el inicio hasta estas letras
Yo siempre dije una oracion completa
En cambio tu me diste de tu vida
Solo una version

Hoy en mi pensar
No lo vi dificil poder contar donde iban mis pasos
Te di algun secreto soñando en silensio
Ser complice de tus adentros

Mientras terminaba cada dia
Me quedaba con historias incompletas
Le faltaba siempre algo un ingrediente a tu receta
Era aquel que la volviera mayonesa

Esta vida tuya y mia
Fue tan perfecta en este cuento en mi cabeza
Pensado de capaz de tener fuerza
Para salir de donde estabas
Y mostrar por fin tus alas

Esta vida tuya y mia
Ha sido clara del el inicio hasta estas letras
Yo siempre dije una oracion completa
En cambio tu me diste de tu vida
Solo una version

Y yo no se explicarte
Tampoco mentirte
Ya se ha roto todo aquel efecto que me daba
El soñar con tu llamada
De dormir con tu almohada

Fue tan perfecta en este cuento en mi cabeza
Pensado de capaz de tener fuerza
Para salir de donde estabas
Y mostrar por fin tus alas

Kany García,"Feliz, me siento hoy que no estas
Sabiendo que jamas tengo q hablar contigo
Ya no estas conmigo y me da felicidad
Por fin no me he de preocupar
A quien le has de hablar
Cambiando mis historias

Las calles son más grandes desde que no estás
Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito más feliz

Al verme decidir no regalarte mas mi tiempo y compañía
Yo se que algún día veras la soledad
Yo te di minutos de perdón
Sabiendo q tu error no era merecido

Las calles son más grandes desde que no estás
Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito más feliz

Ingrato el tiempo aquel q yo pase contigo
Fue ingrato el tiempo, los segundos y momentos en que tu
Me hicistes mal

Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito mas feliz

Kany García,"Hoy les dire mi realidad
Y asi no se pregunten más
Porque ya no me ven con hombres tan apuestos
Toda mi vida lo intente
Pero al final todo era igual
Nunca encontraba lo que yo buscaba dentro
Reconoci que en los ojos no se llena el alma
Que nadie se le compara a quien hoy me acompaña
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Asi esta mija, ninguno de ellos se busca andar conmigo
""Anda conmigo""
Digan lo que digan yo soy el elejido-
Quien pensaria que detras
De sus palabras iba a estar
Esa creación del cielo que hoy toma mi mano
Algunas le dijeron no por eso cuando dije si me ha sido fiel 
Y mucho mas que lo soñado yo se muy bien que este amor durará 
Para siempre creo que nunca yo fui tan feliz
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Anda conmigo
Oye niña que probaste y me pelaste con el que nunca vaya de pelo lacio
Que lo nuestro es todo aca no en el gimnasio, y que la ceja no me saco
Que ando contigo porque tu quisiste estar conmigo esto no le 
Agrada ni a tus enemigos pararte en seco pocas hacen eso por 
Eso ná más te respeto, cuando uno cree se ve que no es como
Parece y lo que aprendiste son estupideses que los prejuicios
Son pá los que se fijan por eso soy el feo de la nena linda
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Ese soy yo tego calderon
Es el feo de la calle
Ven a bailarte
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
La legacia ves
Es el feo de la calle con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Esta bien

Anda conmigo
Anda conmigo",El Feo
Kany García,"Como había pensado fue pasando el día
Todo calculado sin haber sonrisas más que las medidas
Sin algún te quiero sólo indispensable
Allí te apareces tu
Cambiaste el mundo en medio día
Hoy no sé hasta donde ir
Pues nadie puede darnos esa guía

Hasta donde he de aguantar este silencio
Hasta cuando me voy a decir te quiero
Hasta donde he de callar
Dime cuanto debo sujetarme el alma
Hasta donde amor
Voy mostrando todo lo que
Llevo dentro

A veces te sueño y vuelo contigo a algún
Paraíso que tu y yo escogimos
A veces me miro y debo frenarme
Porqué me doy cuenta que mi alma arde
Como hace tanto no lo hacía
Que debo entregarme guardándome de a poco
Que ironía

Hasta donde he de aguantar este silencio
Hasta cuando me voy a decir te quiero
Hasta donde he de callar
Dime cuanto debo sujetarme el alma
Hasta donde amor
Voy mostrando todo lo que llevo

Hoy camino en una nube
Y aunque a veces doy la espalda
No es pensando en que te alejes
Es a ver si tu la abrazas

Hasta donde he de aguantar este silencio
Hasta cuando me voy a decir te quiero
Hasta donde he de callar
Dime cuanto debo sujetarme el alma
Hasta donde amor
Voy mostrando todo lo que llevo dentro

Dime tu hasta donde",Hasta Dónde
Kany García,"Me sentí segura
De esta despedida
Porque lo hice todo
Te entregue la vida
Me canse de hablarte
Y de esperar repuestas
Sin ver que cumpliste alguna promesa

Y el amor se fue
Volando de las manos
Se me fue escapando
Gracias a tu olvido

Y hoy
Hoy que no estas
Que no esperaba mas de ti
Ahora es que deseas hacerme feliz
Que tristeza da, ver que no miraste
Cuando te esperaba
Es muy tarde ya!

Hoy con tu regreso
Hoy con tus intentos
Van a mi memoria
Cual fotografía
Tanto que te dije
Lo que deseaba
Y sin ver repuestas yo aun así te amaba

Pero cada día
Nunca pasa en vano
Y el cansancio
Se hizo mi mayor aliado

Y hoy
Hoy que no estas
Que no esperaba mas de ti
Ahora es que deseas hacerme feliz
Que tristeza da, ver que no miraste
Cuando te esperaba
Que tristeza da, ver que no miraste
Cuando te esperaba
Es muy tarde ya!

De nada vale
Que seas el hombre
Que una vez soñe
No, me vale ya
Que mandes flores
Pues no se trata
De que te perdone
Si el tiempo no vuelve
Porque se te antoje

Y hoy
Hoy que no estas

Que injusta se nos vuelve ya la vida
Que hubo cuando no es lo que creías

Trillada se me escuchan las palabras
Es que a todos nos tocan algún día
De amar nadie se libra aunque así quiera
Tampoco de romperse el corazón

Como camino yo
No sé si alguien hoy pueda igualarme
Como e llorado yo
No se si en este día exista alguien
Alguien sin vida alguien
Hecho pedazos alguien
Alguien que amo
Qué vida la que vivo y que te marchas
A todos hablare de tu partida

Yo no quiero ni salir hasta las esquina
Solo de aquí me arreglo en 11 días
Espero que te vaya bien en todo
Es que aun con esta gran herida
Yo no tengo que guardarte un sentimiento
De esos que traen pena y agonía
Como camino yo

Todo el dolor que me causaste

Que cuánto sería lo que aguantaría

Ya se vuelve en este espacio entre tú y yo 
Kilómetros eternos llenos de dolor y no 
Tenerte duele y no decirlo duele
Coro:
Yo quiero darte la gloria cantarte un beso 
Cuando llegas pero me contengo 
Para que no veas que sueño con que me quieras

Yo quiero darte la gloria cantarte un beso 
Cada vez que llegas pero me contengo 
Para que no veas que sueño con que me quieras",Que Me Quieras
Kany García,"Con esta guitarra mal trecha
Escribo esta canción de dos
Pa' hablar de ti con lazo y cuerda
Sería muy halagador

Si te canto con toa la orquesta
Entonces te haría un favor
Pero te cuento que hoy hay fiesta
Y va en nombre de tu traición

Pero te cuento que hoy hay fiesta
Y va en nombre de tu traición

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Yo quiero que te des la vuelta
Y no pa' que conmigo vuelvas
Si no pa' verte suplicar

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Todo se paga en esta tierra
Con tu traición iba a la guerra
Yo quiero que te valla mal…

Yo me olvide de tu nobleza
Cuando tú me dijiste adiós
Te pregunte con gentileza
Dijiste… se acabó el amor

Al par de días te veo con esa
Que te acaricia con pasión
No hay na`peor que un embustero
Que juega con el corazón

Hay no hay na` no hay na`peor que un embustero
Que juega con el corazón

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Yo quiero que te des la vuelta
Y no pa`que conmigo vuelvas
Si no pa`verte suplicar

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Todo se paga en esta tierra
Con tu traición iba a la guerra
Yo quiero que te valla mal…

Mentiroso, paquetero, embustero
Traicionero, ratero, pillo, traidor
Tú no tienes madre
Sin vergüenza, enamorao
Inventor, impotente, y cue

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Yo quiero que te des la vuelta
Y no pa' que conmigo vuelvas
Si no pa' verte suplicar

Yo quiero que te valla mal
Todo se paga en esta tierra
Con tu traición iba a la guerra
Yo quiero que te valla mal",Que Te Vaya Mal
Kany García,"Si me falta la luz, si me quedo sin aire
Si vendí hasta la casa o algún viejo anillo
Vuelvo a empezar de nuevo pues no todo es perdido
Lo que vale la vida no anda en mis bolsillos

Ay de mi, ay de mi si yo me olvido
Del camino que me lleva hasta la casa, de donde siempre he venido oh

Si alcanzo la cima si vivo la gloria
Si le pago algún viaje a algún viejo amigo
Que allá en las estrellas no olvide el motivo no no
Lo que vale la vida no anda en mis bolsillos

Ay de mi, ay de mi si yo me olvido
Del camino que me lleva hasta la casa, de donde siempre he venido oh

Quizás puedas donarme lo que a ti te falta
O quizás lo que me falta esta en tu camino oh oh
Pero lo que yo tengo no sera vendido

Kany García,"Debo hacer claro 
Que no me lamento 
Que no me arrepiento en haberte soltado 
Que se que merezco más de lo que has dado 

Y que duele que, juegue al honesto 
No voy con traiciones 
Acepto que aún te dedico canciones 
Quizás no las mismas que oíamos siempre 
Si diste de apoco y me fui claramente 

Hoy, hoy es de esos días que lloro 
Que sufro con algún recuerdo 
Que un día fui feliz con tus besos 
Pero hoy me doy el lujo de extrañarte 
Si al fin yo estoy hecha de carne 
No pienses que porque fui yo, me duele menos 

Y sé que quizás crees que me fui temprano 
que pude hacer más por haberlo intentado, 
podríamos estar mil noches peleándonos esto 

Pero hoy, hoy es de esos días que lloro 
Que sufro con algún recuerdo 
Que un día fui feliz con tus besos 
Pero hoy me doy el lujo de extrañarte 
Si al fin yo estoy hecha de carne 
No pienses que porque fui yo, me duele menos 
No duele menos 

Olvidarte y sacar tu recuerdo de mi 
Y aunque mañana yo mire hacia el frente me duele tanto, y tanto amor 
Pero hoy, hoy es de esos días que lloro 
Que sufro con algún recuerdo 
que un día (que un día) fui feliz con tus besos 

Hoy me doy el lujo de extrañarte

Kany García,"Aquí sigo contando los segundos
Desde que me abrazó la soledad
Desde que te me fuiste sin maletas
Un viaje que es de ida y nada más

Vuelve
Que un beso nos quedó pendiente
Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir
Darías azules de gris, que nublan mi mundo
Si estuvieras aquí, ya no dolería seguir
Buscándole el sentido a cada paso de este rumbo
Si tú estuvieras aquí

De a ver sabido de ese último día
Te habría hecho desayuno y conversar
Con un te quiero el tiempo frenaría
Pero el destino se negó a esperar

Vuelve
Que un beso nos quedó pendiente
Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir
Darías azules de gris, que nublan mi mundo
Si estuvieras aquí, ya no dolería seguir
Buscándole el sentido a cada paso de este rumbo
Si tú estuvieras aquí
Aquí conmigo

No, no no, vuelve
Que recordar no es suficiente
Oh, uelve
Que no estoy listo para perderte

Kany García,"Cae al suelo, un sueño sin alas
Y nada puedo hacer yo
A pesar de todo lo que dimos
Aunque el miedo llegue
Sin invitación

Debo dar un salto al vacío
Por el bien de los dos
Y aunque las razones hoy me sobran
Nunca he sido buena
Pa' eso del adiós

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

Quizás unas copas
De un buen vino tinto
Anestesien el dolor
Quizá si empaco todo y salgo huyendo
Pues nunca he sido buena
Pa' eso del adiós

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

¿Cómo mantengo fuerte y firme la mirada?
¿Cómo pensar que ahora se acaba?
Luego de tanto, luego de tanto
Y ahora ¿cómo lograr soltarme el nudo en la garganta?
¿Cómo enfrentarlo? ¿Cómo le digo?
¿Cómo si nada?

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

Kany García,"Sabes que me la juego entera en un latido
Pero suave que anda el corazón desprotegido
Tu tira de mi pa lo que quieras yo llego hasta a ti a mi manera
Te invitó a este mundo pequeñito donde solo somos dos
Y si te quedas es tan solo sabiendo que andaremos lento
Y si me esperas de algún modo pasamos de verano a invierno
Y si llueve y te quedas me quedo yo oh oh oh

Kany García,"Libre, libre 
Libre, libre 

Salgo a la calle, y me preguntan que cómo estoy yo
Después que tu te has ido? 
Que si me quito mis sandalias y ese día no me peino, murmuran
Que estoy tan deprimido

Me pongo mi camisa, más bonita
Combina con corbatita, pantalones y una linda sonrisita
Me tomo una fotito, pa' subirme la morada
Ahora resulta que me he vuelto a enamorar

Camino, soltando el pasado 
Y soy libre, libre libre 
Así voy dejando mis culpas 
Y me vuelvo libre, libre libre 

Libre pa' soltarte, para no amarrarme 
Libre como pajarillos, vuelan en el aire 
Libre pa' desearte vida abundante 
Libre pa' dejarte, porque no eres mi otra parte

Dentro a mi casa y me pregunto 
Que como estoy yo, si ya no estas conmigo 
Y así me aferro a ese momento 
Y vivo con el sentimiento, que fue honesto conmigo 

Y llamo algún amigo y digo, quiero estar contigo 
Pa tomarme algún vinillo, para escuchar algún disquillo 
O me quedo tranquilo, pongo sabanas de hilo 
Y una peli que me haga suspirar 

Camino, soltando el pasado 
Y soy libre, libre libre 
Así voy dejando mis culpas 
Y me vuelvo libre, libre libre 

Libre pa' soltarte, para no amarrarme 
Libre como pajarillos, vuelan en el aire 
Libre pa' desearte vida abundante 
Libre pa' dejarte, porque no eres mi otra parte 

Como hoja al viento 
Así me siento yo 
Y de nada, de nada 
De nada me arrepiento 

Camino, soltando el pasado 
Y soy libre, libre libre 
Así voy dejando mis culpas 
Y me vuelvo libre, libre libre 

Libre pa' soltarte, para no amarrarme 
Libre como pajarillos, vuelan en el aire 
Libre pa' desearte vida abundante 
Libre pa' dejarte, porque no eres mi otra parte

Sin saber me puse la camisa al revés

Se cae el celular cuando iba a llamar
La mujer de al lado me comienza a gritar
Qué lento tu caminas
Ve y hazte a la orilla

Dando mil excusas
Para no hablarme en la casa

Ábreme la puerta, dame una caricia
Agárrame un seno, dime que te erizas
Despiertame en la madrugada
Que aquí ya no pasa nada

Sé que esto llego a su final

Y si me quedo
Donde no quiero caminar
Donde no me siento feliz

Porque mi miad se encuentra justo entre en mis manos

Crazy
Why cant she just runaway
Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Twenty four seven, three sixty five, 
Pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, 
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your best move, 
You could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
Split and go where? 
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know where I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can",Runaway [Edited Version]

Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
Too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the,
Chi-Town what's going on man

I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry the Mr. H says that the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her life support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru,
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys are Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dog don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man",Through the Wire [Multimedia Track]

Kanye West,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Oh, now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break next to the
'No Smoking' sign with a blunt in the mall

Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love

Lock yourself in a room
Doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like Cree summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that, deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky, oh
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Ahh, shit
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed? Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine

Only wanna ball, never wanna fall
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine
Got a tech nine, reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til twelve when my schedule had said nine
Puttin' 'em pants on shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself

Where I wanna go, where I wanna be?
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holla at God, man, why'd you had to take my folks?

Hope to see Freddy G, Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
Man I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow

Workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit (aw man, this pressure)
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky, oh oh oh",Spaceship [Live] [Live]

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious

Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to apologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)

First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin', 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is

I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D... a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale thats usin' a toothpick

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $3.99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss

But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't goin' cost me because she my caddy
'Cause she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug

She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan

While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexus's one on both hand
So I guess them GS's was ambidextrous

Could of sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""

So say my name like Candyman
And I'm a come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Kanye West,"This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'

Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing

They don't mean a thing, a thing

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""

So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. 
And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. 
I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. 
And No ID told him, ""Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""


I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

[Jay-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[Jay-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[Jay-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]

Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up

[Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat
To DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said ""man that was tight.""

[Jay-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. 
So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

Kanye West,"Hey Jimmy where you going?

I don't know where I'm going.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say ""Dad, why don't you work?"",
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.
These are documented.
My father left them for me.

I'm going to learn too.

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

And your mothers saying ""go to college""
So you finish college and its wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and crazing
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey now you'll get that  25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money
No more borrowing money from mom for my high
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level
Which is being a secretary's secretary!
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary 
Who never went to college
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart man
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, 
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied

Then you get your master's masters,
Then you get your doctron,
You go man, then when everybody says quit
You show them those degree man, when
Everybody says hey, your not working,
Your not making in money,
You say look at my degrees and you look at my life,
Yeah I'm 52, so what, hate all you want,
But I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school,
And these guys are out here making 
Money all these ways, and I'm spended mine to be smart.

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt!
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
'Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dog, don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now

We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid

Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work

We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Bad enough we on welfare

I'm trying to get the car with the chromie wheels here
They trying to cut our lights out like we don't live here

Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account

Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd

Kanye West,"For all my niggaz, that drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only a dope man, I knew that wasn't a coke man
Flickin' starter coats man, man, you know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggaz outside all winter
'Cuz this summer they ain't finna to say next summer, I'm finna
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no to tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
We forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown

Say, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5
That still hustle, a nigga can't shine off 6.55
And everybody sellin' make-up, Jacobs
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

My momma say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
Around the same time, Doe ran up in dudes house, couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game polemic, it's hard to get weight
Niggaz money is homo, it's hard to get straight
We gon' keep bakin' to the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say

My niggaz, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
But the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

Kanye West,"Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, 'cause
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink
I'm supposed to stop I can't because

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is why'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are why'all OK man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Are, are, are, right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is

Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method

Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases

I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long

So long

To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny

The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave

Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me ""don't touch me""
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said ""I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes""
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said ""Ye' you don't love me""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior

This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as buck-fifty's and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building

I wish I could give you this feeling

Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

The name is mine, I'll take blame for that

How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix

And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

I'm

And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause

Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
It's for yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porscha"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't because

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

(Diamonds are forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

You know the next question dog, ""Yo where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
""What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?""

Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Kanye West,"Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin' involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin' lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them four's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie

Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?

That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it

Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like Rob would say
Before you ask me to get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil' cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of the noun

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

Kanye West,"(Hey mama) I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (hey mama)

(Hey mama) I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say Mama, now everybody answer me (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (hey mama)

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)",Hey Mama

I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'f***er up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'f***er up only if it feels right

Stop all your blood claat cryin, I was flyin
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear you mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best cla**es go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good cla**es, and that's what yo' a** get
Not even electives? Not even prerequits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop cla** or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'f***ers underachievin
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all (Depends), oh, oh
... Stop you're cryin baby

You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bulls***tin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah

Kanye West,"Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale, Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it

""Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again""",My Way Home
Kanye West,"I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in?
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma was in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""One Thing""
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we know where home is
And so instead of sendin' flowers, we the roses

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

It brings the sunshine, oh

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

I smile when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (say)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day

Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks

Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment

Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man - these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth

I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop ""lion"" like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat

In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

But now I need you to do it faster baby, can you please, do it faster, do it
Faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
And I be sipping Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's r&b, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feeling me
And still will be in love wit me

She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not having that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga bragging on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""

Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars

Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Since 86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still want to know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and Ask the kids
What they definition of Classic is
Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters
Everybody co-signing even non-believers
I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas
Probably worn when KRS One teaches
Nas, made you look, before the haters
I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus
This is classic

Classic, better than I've ever been
Talent,
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Classic
Better than I've ever been

Can't buy this, super flyness, like a shyness, your highness
It's performing, look how long the line is
That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed til you listened to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident, and y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been

Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time
It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, 
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets silent, it's just I and, cops keep firing in my environment
Leaving your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to

How many y'all got criminal minded you you you y'all don't be blinded
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why, I don't need 'em I got your respect
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock, this hip hop
And we's a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoking trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC'ing and rap

And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother


Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends

And from that point I never blow her off

They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new

You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of those bad nights, ya'll have a bad fight
And you talking 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say ""Motherfucker, yo momma's a bitch!""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all that attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you!
But I'mma be the bigger man, Big Pimpin' like Jiggaman

I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this

It's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having our child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time I would try, you would question me
Saying ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me?
You don't see how ya lies is affecting me
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you'll always be where them hoes'll be""

My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then

People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams

So close, but so far

But for some reason I can never find what real love is about

There is no Louis Vuitton to put on

That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life

I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight

Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, ""Where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin', say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?

I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes

And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more
I can't
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money to death
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say ""Kanye, you keep it too real boy""

""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"" (else, else, else)

You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too

Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money

You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
You probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls

And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

Kanye West,"Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said,
""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it,
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

Kanye West,"Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner",Corners

I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79th

But I'm looking for more

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again

Kapena,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

Karan Casey,"In the morning we built the city
In the afternoon walked through its streets
Evening saw us leaving
We wandered through our days as if they would never end
All of us imagined we had endless time to spend
We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave
To the landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave
Cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave

Did you learn to dream in the morning?
Abandon dreams in the afternoon?
Wait without a hope in the evening?
Did you stand there in the traces and let them feed you lies?
Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes?
Did you kiss the foot that kicked you? Did you thank them for their scorn?
Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born?
Act of being born, act of being born

Did you alter the face of the city?
Make any change in the world you found?
Or did you observe all the warning?
Did you read the trespass notice? Did you keep off the grass?
Did you shuffle off the pavement just to let your betters pass?
Did you learn to keep your mouth shut? Were you seen and never heard?
Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word?
Jump to at a word, jump to at a word

And did you ever demand any answer?
The who and the what and the reason why
And did you ever question the setup?
And did you stand aside and let them choose while you took second best?
Did you let them skin the cream off and then give to you the rest?
Did you settle for the shoddy? And did you think it right
To let them rob you right and left and never make a fight?
And never make a fight, never make a fight

What did you learn in the morning?
How much did you know in the afternoon?
Were you content in the evening?
And did they teach you how to question when you were at the school?
Did the factory help you grow? Were you the maker or the tool?
Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then?
Did you mix among the standing of all your fellow men?
All your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men",Ballad of Accounting
Karan Casey,"She's like the swallow that flies on high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore
I love my love, but love is no more

A maiden into her garden did go
For to pluck her some wild primrose
The more she plucked, the more she did pull
Until this maiden's apron was full

Then out of these roses she made a bed
A scarlet pillow for her head
She laid her down, no words she did speak
And then this maiden's heart, it did break

She's like the swallow that flies on high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore

The thing they fear most is
That I might want to stay
By their side on a distant shore

Karaoke,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Without You [High key performance track w/o background vocals]

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand

Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own

But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me
So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you baby
Or just a brilliant disguise

Now look at me baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter
The gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me baby
Or just a brilliant disguise

Tonight our bed is cold
Lost in the darkness of our love

Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors

Looking for something pretty I could hang on my wall
I knocked over a lamp before it hit the floor I caught it
A salesman turned around said, boy, you break that thing you bought it

You can look but you better not touch
Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy
You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch

Well I came home from work and I switched on channel five
There was a pretty little girly lookin' straight into my eyes
Well I watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen
She didn't get me excited she just made me feel mean

I took her out to the drive-in just to get her alone 
I found a lover's rendezvous, the music low, set to park 
I heard a tappin' on the window and a voice in the dark

For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
And I will stand for my dream if I can
A symbol of my faith in who I am

And I will follow
On the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only

He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town.

In a garage by the motorway

To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man

His family business thrives

Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus

But I just couldn't say good-bye.

To walk away from someone who
Means everything in life to you.
You learn from every lonely day

Think of all we had before,
Let me try once more.
We can have it all, you and I again.

I was such a fool to doubt you,
To try to go it all alone.
There's no sense to life without you.
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed.
To beg is not an easy task,
But pride is such a foolish mask.

Karate,"Gloves hold you in.
Accessorize.
Corners of sin, and potential crimes.
The cold scolds your chin.
Draws some salt from an eye,
But even the winds can't get much of a rise.

How long will it take you to want to go home?
How long will it take you to learn there is none?
You were a sister, a daughter; just what was your role?
In a family now scorned by stitches and holes.

You got no where to be.
So you just can't get lost.
And your fool of a substance that melts heavy frost.
I'd want to take you to dinner,
But you'd rather hang out at rest-stops engaging in discourse better scratched into desktop.

Then your phone rings. 
It's just me.
How long will it take you to trust me?
I'm coming down to get you even though you don't answer.
Because the snow was okay, but the rain in coming faster.

Water sinks in
Faster then thickens.
My Pockets, my pockets are drinking.
Your fingers, my fingers are sinking.",Water
Karate High School,"Good evening, sir. 
I have both good news and bad news. 
What do you want to hear first? 

But before you open your mouth 
And give me an excuse 
To strike you down 
With a bright lighting bolt, 
Let's just say that before you choose, 
You should know that either way you lose.
It's a tough choice, I know. 

But that's how it goes. 
""Well if I have to know today, 
Give me the good news first."" 
The good news is that it's the end of the line, 
And all things heal with time, so just let go. 
The bad news is that while time heals all wounds, 
It will eventually be the thing that kills you. 

Look, I know
I can't live my life without eventually trusting 
In something bigger. 
It's just so hard 
For me to let things go, 
Even though I know it's beyond my control.

It's a tough choice, I know. 
But that's how it goes. 
""Well if I have to know today, 
Give me the good news first."" 

The good news is that it's the end of the line, 
And all things heal with time, so just let go.
The bad news is that while time heals all wounds, 
It will eventually be the thing that kills you. 

And what's so wrong with that?
Living forever is overrated. 
And after we take the first step towards 
Forgiving ourselves, 
You know what happens? 
We're never the same. 
No, never again.

Got a Blueprint like Thrust, said he's notorious
And watch the hit bust all over the country (fo' real)

Dis so all you niggas discover just who the dapper is
Causing discomfort, disallowing your dis-jock to rock

And all the brothers in the streets gettin' high
Give thanks for your life because yo things will change
Ghetto people suffering will soon in-herit the game

The last will come first and the first will come last
And the good will take a seat in the holiest of mass
And blast out the world sin, hard times we living in
I am trying to do the best I can living with my breddrens

The world is filled with negative and positive
Never judge a man what he is is what he is
And I am an ill bro blessed with an ill flow
With an opportunity to rep the T-dot O

And try to spread some of the blessings, lyrical dressings
And I am guessing that your listening to what I am addressing
Especially since I'm rhymiing from my heart
Trying to supress the craziness before it even starts

Yo every gun man has to have a soft spot
Every thug nigga has gotta have some heart
It's these things that I hold to be true
So I don't have to pray that they won't blast you

If my pops was here he would tell me enjoy every single day
And support your family 'cause blood comes first for real
Nevermind about trying to sign a deal

Just do what you gotta do and do it like the best
Even when it seems that people C-Bn' for no reason
Don't study the treason, function like a G'
And with that, the world is ready steady f-ing with me

Admiring who I be, I take it as flattery
I must exemplify just what it is to be an emcee
I breathe in the tragedy and breathe out a song of hope
Free from government, politics, lies, plus the Pope

The 5.0 sells dope, police make nuff sales
We're taken out of the hood and locked up with no bail
But either way we get out and try to turn it around
You can't see it but you feel it in the sound, you know dat

If everyone could see just how I see

If everyone could see just how I see

And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

I'm not a reverend, a preacher, V.P. or teacher
But still I gotta reach and none can impeach
But the most high spiritual, virtually physical
Higher power more than capable to make miracle

In every black home and in every jail cell
And in everyone of us to let the righteous set sail
And accept positioning, whether you a Christian
A Jew, or Muslim, yo have faith in him

The G's in the street know what I'm talking about
The man dem on the corner, surviving with no doubt
The kids in the park trying to keep things real
Yo, who don't hear muss feel? You know that

My verse is like a hearse for your marketing scheme
My whole steez nigga please, put the mic down
Talking 'bout you represent, when you embarrassing your town
Walking around with the Gay Pride parade crown
Silicone raps underneath that pink gown
Posing as a killer when you living as a clown
Entertaining A&R's too deaf to hear the sound
You a has-been rapper, talking 'bout your style's nice
Saying I'm independent now, looking for a new life
A weak DJ, living off of 80's fame
Guess starring in the Basement, living off of Tigga's name
My name's Kardinal, the pearl mic dark figure
Diploma type thoughts mixed up with street niggas
Living underground trying to earn the pop loot
'Cause I won't sell crack and got no aim to shoot
No patience for the weed, not quick enough to tief
Can't pimp, don't like fur coats or gold teeth
But I can rock the hell out of a fat ass beat

Delivered to your Jubby, my charms tribes quest for hot sex
No bust for the next can protect

And the skins are saying wet wet wet wet wet
I'm dripping in 'nuff girls, and missing what we trying to say
But talking about a revolution, end up talking about the day
When they can feel a rapper's privates, I'm looking for your mind
But I'm seeing all your titties and a big round behind
Oh damn girl, you make think 'bout selling out
But oops, your weave just fell out
Ha ha
I'm straight from the place that first brought you Vince Carter
The story of Hurricane, and imported sugar cane
And snappy pop coming out three for a dollar
What, Peter loves who?  Yo don't bother to hail it up
In the streets where we meet 'cause you might get beat
And find your head caught between timbos and concrete
And that's real, a lot of ignorant peeps around the way
Ain't trying to bend over to the madness of the day
But do what to do and yo who am I to say
I just want your records sales anyway
You see me

Yo, easy rude bwoy, give me a little second to breeze through
We make the track jump, so it's hard to roll trees to
No matter give me no daps nigga, I ain't trying to please you
Want to flow with me, can't afford the fees duke
Claiming street raps when Jeff Healey could see through
Your wonder bra rah rah, {garbage like bad pot}
Go ahead like punk trick and watch where you land
I'm a shady black slim, you a nigga I can't stand
Move! kid, this some celebrity next shit
Step up and watch the next celebrity hanging by they necklace
Peasants! Think about what you getting into
We hardcore, bump those little fist fights we've been through
We done did it, never mind can or can do
We trying to make it easier for our fam to Land Cruise
You sell the same weed at the same spot
We graduated to the high grade lyrics pon cock

I've been autobahn rhyme ever since primetime
Saw George and Wheezy sipping on fine wine
The ghetto scream {rewind} like daylight savings time
Bring it back, firing legal hollows out the Ac'

We bring the ebony stone, now watch me carve it out
Bump my shit in tenement housing

So bitch freeze, your motivation evident

I was born a regular man of the Earth
With a curse to walk like a soldier since birth
My exterior is shaded in by my melanin
Stereotype of my type is a felon
My people cause static cause automatically now a days we fire automatics
Grammatically adequate my people come equipped
With enough lyrics to move battleships
Blood brother ever since the slave ships
It doesn't matter who I am when I walk by
They still see me as a nigga whine I walk by
That's O.K. - this nigga will play the role and 
come again and take back the Earth another day

Walkin through Rexdale a black man (nigga)
Strollin through Dectaur as a black man (nigga)
Yo, I was born to emcee representin with the Figurez
I can taste the history livin in my bones
For the thickness I got a love jones
I like my girls with the nappy dug out hips and chest buss out
Lips real full, gettin ready to cuss out
Parasuco gettin insulated by the structure
Body so powered that the labels be stickin out in 3-D
We salute the ladies - raped over time pushin out light babies
The slave masters with the devil in their eye
Saw nothin but a nigga when you walked by
But you the mother of creation
Let's bring back the family aspect and try to build a strong nation

Soft rock?  Or hard rock?

Before you set a float your whole concepts sinkin
You know I like to see you back that ass up

Blessin' this, effortless, mess with this, eff with this
If you think you got a chance to dance with your devilish messages
Stressing this can only lead to battery
You rattle me, request to battle me I take as flattery
I see ya, grip your bible,I'm the lyrically homicidal idol

Don't make me ask you to respect me please

Imaginary gats busting just don't faze me
Lick a shot, wave your flag, gunfinga in the air

In handcuffs and other shackles (yo) check Mr. Bush
Plant cocaine on me and call it operation push
Our Prime Minister is actually second in command
Bending over to the star spangled-politically strangled

Off the top and all that

Dear Lord,
I really, I don't even know how to ax this
You know, I can't, this this this is not an act
I must, from the bottom of my heart, ask forgiveness for my sins
But you know what
I ask that you give me the strength to be able to reach 
all of those peoples, on every street corner, every block, every ghetto
All of those people, that we sometimes think are not worthy of blessings, 
they're worthy to me
And I think that as a man given the blessings you have given me
The opportunity to speak, that I need to speak the language 
of those people, and I need to reach them
You know, because there's are a lot of good people on this Earth, 
but there still some people that need a talking to
And I ask you to give me the strength to reach out to those people
You know because I believe everybody is worthy of your blessings
So I ask that you give, you give me, my family, my crew, F.O.S, the circle
All of us, all the babies that are being born
You give us the strength to be able to deal with it how you see fit
because you give all of us the power, as much as some people might not believe it
You give us the strength to reach out and touch a lot people
So Lord I ask you give me the strength to go out in the world and start the fire
You know, start your fire, you understand I'm saying
Lord, just please be with me, be with me 
and give me the strength and let me do this

Throw some bullets at your feet
Show you what ya missing, listen I hope for black love without wishing
I murder the track and go neck to neck without kissing
I'm ducking from the wack flows, calling it dis-missing
Big money in the hook, cats is loot fishing
Nigga's adding ones like they was mathematicians
Four plus y'all equals more without addition, listen
Cooking up plans in a da kitchen
Too many chefs leads to nuff cats bitching
Love in a we face behin' we back yuh teet' kissin
Whether you're garbage or not is not my decision

Filling the track with hot lead without bussin'

Freaking the three bands of frequencies, frequently
I frequently gather frequent flyer miles
I be freaking the same chick that you're admiring
The same G, ask them niggas around me
The P maybe free, but my tracks cost money
I might talk funny, but this nigga is no dummy
Now cough up my dough before I have to call Sunny
Switch switchblades, to switch hand grenades
I switch when a bitch nigga misses my payday

Quick to flow whenever the mic is in session

Your outside is smiling, but what's your intention
F a judge and stil get an honourable mention
Tell ya peace and love without both my fists clenching
Raps with real flows real re-invention
Chat on wicked tracks, add new dimensions
New cliques, gang bang causing old tensions
Niggas in the streets with swords like street fencing
For these record labels nuff rap cats is Benson
From these old street cats, I took a lesson
Never like groupie hoes hanging in my session
Rolling over weak cats in one succession
Who's up next, we got nuff headz guessing

And them Gators on your feets cost more then your bail

And ya can relate to the rhyme I'm spittin' in the song
You know you ghetto when ya best clothes, is your dress clothes
And dress is Paco jeans and Jelly slippers, namean?
You know you ghetto when ya askin' for  some cigarettes
'Cause you can't afford hash to mix with that weed in your stash
You know you ghetto when you tryin' to get your flirt on

(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think that you're fly

[Kardinal]
Yo
You know you ghetto when you bring home your boys
And your auntie's lookin' at your crew like they sex toys
You know you ghetto when your brothers paid from jugglin'
And you driving his Range, talking 'bout nigga we strugglin'
You know you ghetto when ya sittin' down in class
And dang, a cockroach went and crawled out ya book bag
You know you ghetto when ya tried to rap like DMX
And you get your breddren to do you video because you can't afford Little X
You know you ghetto when rap is part of your dream
But you can't stay out past one cause your mom runs your street team
You know you ghetto when ya savin' to buy a key
But your grand pop is still on the corner pushin' that weed
You know you ghetto when you know you not Jamaican
But your clothes say Tommy Sean John nigga you fakin'
You know you ghetto when ya like every other brotha
Rappin' loud, walking down the street tryin' to be discovered

CHORUS [Kardinal] (Circle crew)
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are, when ya think you a star
Flossin' on the street in the rental car
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think that your nice
But the opposite don't look twice
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O
(You're Ghetto)
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O

So where I rest I'm stressed by the 5-0 (here we go)
Cops drive around the turf, lookin' for someone to search
With they flashlights checkin' in my dashboard
(whatchu lookin' for?)
Or lookin' for the heat stashed under the seat
But I'm a rudebwoy, plus everything is legit (you knew it)
Worked too damn hard for my things (that's right)
I'm a celeb, I heard +99 problems+
But understand that every rudebwoy is a king
So we watched, no face, and just play along
Everything I own's bling to the ding (dun'know)
Them niggas think they have me shook but they dead wrong
Them pigs vexed kardi youth have a little bit of fame
Didn't find nothin', so they screw-faced
Plus I never ever once lost my cool (no way!)
It's just a story of an everyday black man
Give thanks that the beast never pulled out they tools

You see I, yes I am an everyday rudebwoy
I am an everyday, an everyday rudebwoy,
I'm an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday rudebwoy

I used to check this girl off in the west set
Had a baby girl by some dude
I used to hear second-hand from her brethren
That the youth was vexed, ""yo kardinal I need food""
I used to hang with the girl every now and then
First met her chillin' out at the club
Body bangin' like she was in king magazine
Chopped her still, even though I wasn't rollin' on dubs
She used to live in the middle of the ghetto
Chickens yellin' on the block in the hood
Sometimes I used to hear the shots bellow
But they respect what I'm doin', so you know it's all good
So as I'm rollin' off, the baby father rollin' out
The youth lookin' at me dead in my eye
I said ""you should have stuck it out with your family
But now that's girl's mean, so don't screw-face me!""
Because

Kardinal Offishall,"It's eight o'clock here in kingston, jamaica
The kingston police have issued an apb
Out for wanted criminal rostacious johnson
He has last been seen headed towards
The united states of america or canada
If you have any info please call us right away

[Chorus]
I was a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat
I had no choice as a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat

Aiyyo, stepped off the edge of 'maica at the age of ten
Landed at the dot airport, comin' out of may pen
Raised by his grandmama, until his real mama
Could send for the youth, and reunite, aiight
So now he's growin' up exposed to the ghetto limelight
No pops (nope) plus his moms got to work nights
Moonlightin' as a janitor, to make bread for the two
All the while he's growin' up, runnin' with a crew
It started off tryin' to make a little extra creamer
But then it turned to pushin' rocks, savin' for the beamer
Told his moms he got a job workin' in the trade
At a local grease monkey, that's how he's gettin' paid
And that's how he got the deal on the black man wagon
Moms thought it was suspect, but she's still braggin'
To her kin about ""how he come home and grow right""
All the while he's wildin' out, money starts pilin' now
The next crew saw the flex and start red eye
Jealous of the way them niggas hustle,
Til he get a little muscle, uh huh, bust a bunch of shots
There my nigga laid, really holdin' down the block
That nigga gangsta

[Chorus]

Hey yo, six weeks in intensive, holdin' on to prayers
On the seventh, he was back on his back in the west wing
His man done came visiting, in his ear whispering
How the block was hot, and there was 'nuff shots whistling
Another week and he was back on his feet
Discharged, ready to get back and hit the street
Moms was still working overtime, clueless to the real
About how his son was livin' in the hood packin' steel
Pushin' coke no joke them cats wanted retaliation
Word got back, about who led the slaughter
One nigga named blaka, real name elroy
Next day (boom) what happened to that boy
For the next three months my man stayed on the low
Told his moms he wasn't workin' cause the garage was slow
But just as he tried to resurface on the strip
Someone on the turf called 222-tips

[Chorus]

Now my man locked up, and had to sweat inside a jail
Cause his man done fled the scene, and moms couldn't afford bail
The trial came and went, his mother cried ""discrimination!""
Said the judge didn't know her son
He said he knew him too well, he'd seen him there before
Turned the cheek cryin', now he feels he's on fire
Got burned by the same liquor, quit talkin' fresh
He doesn't know how to act, so now he got to go back
My man got dipped, sent right back to may pen
Grandma didn't want him, now family wouldn't take him
He thought about work, but he said ""f that!""
He got a fake passport and just came right back

[Chorus: x2]

It is a sunny day here in Jamaica

Yeah, black jays! oh what?

Yo, all the shuckin' and jivin' is over
I'm the chosen soldier, cold shoulder
Your home boys told ya, flip your flows
I fold, you can fertilize with the bs they sold ya
I need papers for the style that I loaned ya
Everybody's talkin' about they gettin' busy, why don't ya?
Weak players in the game steady gettin' over
I'm one of a kind, like side gills on a rover
First name jay, but ain't similar to hova
My buzz is like rum mixed with coca cola
My shine is incredible, versus a solar
I'm sick like a seven-day-strain of ebola
I'm here! yeah, nigga!

[Chorus: x2]
(one more time)
No doubt, when we on the block
Because my niggas came ready to rock, boy

Step heavy like a lion through the jungle
I'm lyin' if I told you that I wasn't raised humble
I'm tryin', but I stumble, I try not to mumble
So you can hear it loud stupid (let's get ready to rumble)
I'll serve you son, like I'm supposed to
The only way I'm bi, is when I'm flyin' bicoastal
Or buyin' fly wears, nike airs like most do
I'm hotter, than the hotter, than the hotter, I'll roast you
Got a good habit of doin' what you won't do
Stop playin' girl, you know I ain't phoned you
Check one of them suckers, you know that they want you
I'm loco with the vocals, most dudes just local
I'm here! yeah, nigga!

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, rudeboys move in silence
Don't want to hustle until they hear sirens
I'm tryin' to be inspirin'
But my 6'4"", 220 has a lot of them kids perspirin'
'nuff dudes firin', too many gettin' shot
So swallow your pride nigga, check whoever is hirin'
The paper gangstas is who I'm admirin'
Those who get paper alive, and still smilin'
Y'all stay wildin', I'm tryin' to go the mile and
I'm rough enough to break new york from long island
If you a big man, why you actin' like a child?
Pick up the pace, and put down the crack vial
I'm here! yeah, nigga!

Hey yo, actions speak louder than words
My middle finger speaks louder than yours
I'm in the hood, feet poundin' the curb
Jealous of nothin', mine is bigger than yours
Standin' still, y'all runnin' with herbs
I stole the soul motherfucker, I ain't bringin' it back
Whack niggas like Jamsport, holdin' me back
And I don't care if you're friends with Jay
Or Dre, or Kay Slay, you're still garbage
Learn to parlay, before you look this way
I'm heinous with mine, Kardinal made this
I don't pay to get on any playlist
Niggas in the street was waitin' for someone to say this
I ain't suckin' dick for y'all DJ's to play this (let 'em know)
My records spin like rims on an Avis
Look at me wrong, and say what's up to Sammy Davis
I'm heavy nigga, the biggest libra couldn't weigh this
Before you kiss your TV, you should kiss my whole anus

At all costs I'm doin' it the fly way
So I never say que sera sera

I got the most superior mainframe in the game
Flows like a fifty-paper, ain't a damn thing changed
On the mic I'm deranged, off the mic I'm just crazy
Spit-shine my letter combos, that's what pays me
In other words it's the nouns and the verbs
That buys the X5's and the cribs on the lakesides
I run this shit, I don't take sides
What you see is what you get, most of these rappers are in disguise
With no persona, so they diss guys
You want to lose your profession? I suggest you test this guy
The best buy in any Best Buy
I'll straight burn the place down like a throwback Left Eye
Ahead of the class, nobody ever left I
I'm so right, I can't even open my left eye
You're dead wrong, tryin' to correct I
I'm like the dead in one way: no choice but to respect I, yeah!

[Chorus]

Yo, everything I do is strong when I rap
I don't bust no verses, I talk in thunder claps
Give black hands daps, and X marks the map
Dot city on my chest, show the world where I'm at
Lift you higher than a three hundred dollar weed pack
And a G4 smuggled in my jacket in the back
Yeah, some question my heart and dedication
Why? I'm into the pulse like a palpitation
Some man dem dat I know hold down the +Big Macs+
And they come and watch you air the beef out (Blak, blak)
That ain't me though, I'm regal like a pharaoh and them

Oh 
Oh 
Oh

Oh 

Yo
It's like speeding down the highway
With a blind fold on
No hands on the wheel
Hopin' God will lead me my way
And I know he real
So my grandma say what I
Feel a sweat from the sun
Cause I work construction
I gotta take care of my son
I got one in the oven on the way
Rents late, two months
Cause my land lord talks too much

Hands full of calises
And I still got the magic touch to make wife blush
I been workin' it out since a high school crush
Fix on the clutch
Minds on my money
But my money ain't there
But I will not resort to welfare I care
Can't stop
Won't stop
Couldn't even do it if I tried
If I said I did I'd die

Could God do me a favour?
I could really use a favour
Could I get it tonight?

No
Christmas here
I'm taking time and a half
Gotta make that cash
Even if a nigga gotta drive that cab
I'm gonna treat it like a limo
Didn't know? y'better ask
Somebody told me
Closed mouths don't eat
Closed eyes may never ever see
So I try with everything I've got to not sleep
But it's hard to run if at first you don't creep
After work take the long way home
See a lotta whips stick out in chrome
Thinkin' about a house but I can't get along
So I day dream on my way back to my zone
Thinkin' about my son look when he full grown
Will he be raised right or another street clone?
Everything I know God knows gotta shown
Lettim know he is not alone
He on

Drownin' in a world o' failure
But
I can't stop 'til my suits are tailored
Well
I really can't trust my neighbours
Some
Only trust in the Lord to save me
I
Gotta believe in the fact
That he must want better for us
Like young C gotta do it for us
My car broke down
Fuck the bus
Fuck the million
Fuck the city laws are unjust
It's like why do I try
When I feel I'm gonna die
Without a tear left in my eye?
I work the hard to see the lease
It's like cultivating the harvest
Not seeing the feast
I don't wanna get philosophical go-to deed
I have faith but I'm afraid to take the lead
Most of what I know
I know holds me back
Instead of learning
I want that lack

You know I'm not into that shit?
Right?

Some of my friends are terrorists
Some of my friends deal crack and I am not OK with this
Some niggas I know only back me because I rake dough like a Gardner
And fuck it I work harder
I don't like most hip hop out
There's a secret society of niggas who wanna shout
""turn that bullshit off!""
I should shut my mouth?
Next thing you know I ain't welcome down south
Of the border
I don't believe in turfs or a section
I believe in community
Where anybody can walk good without protection
I believe that Dyla was the numba one dude in rap
But there on the slaps of haikus
I spite you for not givin' it up
Fuck what that nigga say, nigga give it up

Why black people act like little kids?
Make mad excuses when they know what it is
Be like them white folks invest that shit
Instead niggas clownin' on the red carpet
Showing my niece that a million on the neck
Is the hot shit
Is bloodclated disrespect
And growin' up poor don't make you ignant
Act your age
Don't act your pigment
Race to the top
Don't let your race stop you
From revolution
Open your mouth and bust shots

And while you vex having delusions of persecution
I'm a stay flawless, an instrument of execution
Out of many still grows one people
Justice ? still remain unequal
And I'm a diamond in the dirt
And there is no sequel
Many try but they cannot replicate what we do
Hear evil, speak that evil
Speak good to the hood, there is no retrieval
Think about while you sippin' on your ?

When you see a political publicity stunt.
Will you fight for the right? Will you be a man? 
Will you step aside? Will you give a damn? 

Will you ride that tide with the starry eyed? 
Will you give and take? 
Will you laugh 'til you ache?

Karel Gott,"Du wurdest mit der Krankheit geboren
Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen

Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht

Und dann war's passiert
Hab es nicht kapiert
Ging alles viel zu schnell

Die dürfen sich nie verlier'n!

Hinterm Horizont immer weiter
Zusammen sind wir stark!

Das kann nie zu Ende sein

Die Liebe allein, nur die kann so sein, so sein

Karel Gott,"Du wurdest mit der Krankheit geboren
Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht

Karel Roessingh,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Karel Zich,"I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

(chorus)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? 
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long

Karen Akers,"Isn't it rich? Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around one who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines, no one is there

Don't you love farce? My fault I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want, sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns, don't bother, they're here

Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing in this late in my career?

Karen Akers,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""

While I'm alone and blue as can be

Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

Where you goin', what are your plans
Here's a proposition
Won't you listen and take my hand?

Let's go to a place where
We all share the same mind
There's no politician but religion
And have the time

Everybody ought to praise Him
Just let your feelings flow
Tell everyone you know
There is a praise party goin' on

Join in, go and grab a friend
It's better now than then
It's a praise festival

Let everything that is breathin' partake in the celebration
Don't miss your blessing, forsaken dedication
Praise with your hands or even a dance
There's no competition but religion's a must

Here in my heart, of you I gotta make a motion
You tickle my emotions
And fall in love over and over again

I can't stop my face from glowin'
Because I have the faith in knowin'
That you'll be there in spite of all commotion
So dear your devotions

Showers come when you bless me

A hurricane when your word is sent from above
What I've been dreamin' of and

Ain't nothin' gonna stop my love
My knowledge tells me if I please
You will never leave

Karen Clark-Sheard,"If you ask me, why I really took so long?
It was like waiting for that picture perfect song
If you ask me, why I took so many years?
It?s never easy coping with your fears

If you ask me, how I felt bein' alone?
Where I was weak, God made me strong
If you ask me, if I really feel secure?
Before I say yes, I must be sure

Sunny days don't mean
That it won't ever rain
Money may bring things
But it won't erase the pain

I love you, you love me
But we must be sure
We may be the best of friends
But in the end, it's true love that wins

Gotta be a love that will endure
I gotta be absolutely sure

If you ask me, what proceeds the wedding day?
It's the answers you receive when you pray
And if you find for any reason it's not pure
Before you say yes, you must be sure

Sunny days don't mean
That it won't ever rain
Money may bring things
But it won't erase the pain

I love you, you love me
But we must be sure
We may be the best of friends
But in the end, it's true love that wins

Gotta be a love that will endure
I gotta be absolutely sure

Could it be infatuation or potential?
Losing a battle with temptation would never do
Though I'm not perfect, my objective is to be pure
So please forgive me for the wait, I had to be sure, yeah, yeah
(Please understand)

I love you, you love me
But we must be sure
We may be the best of friends
But in the end, it's true love that wins

Gotta be a love that will endure
I gotta be absolutely sure

If I'm gonna put my trust in you
Gotta be absolutely true
If I'm gonna share my life with you
Gotta be absolutely sure, yeah

Gotta be love that will endure
I gotta be absolutely sure",Be Sure
Karen Clark-Sheard,"You may have done, some things that you're not
To proud of, at one point in your life
Well, you're just one good pray away
From living again, starting today

It's a brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
It's a brand new day

Maybe you were involved in a love gone bad before
Ever since then, you've been bitter and scorn
All those bad feelings, you no longer need to hold
'Cause we're in with the new out with the old

It's a brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
It's a brand new day

Yes it is, things that made you angry in your past
Now you look at them and you can laugh
'Cause they don't and they won't
Matter anymore

It's a brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new, brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new day, oh

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
