Gloria Gaynor,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 
With his song",Killing Me Softly with His Song
Gloria Gaynor,"The heat is on, on the street
Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
Cause the heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on

The shadows are on the darker side
Behind those doors, it's a wilder ride
You can make a break, you can win or lose
That's a chance you take when the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

Gloria Jones,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want IT any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pack my things and go
Tainted love, tainted love 
Tainted love, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love 
Touch me baby, tainted love
Tainted love
Tainted love 
Tainted love",Tainted Love
Gloria Larson,"I'm so very ordinary, nothing special on my own.
Oh, I have never walked on water,
And I have never calmed a storm.
Sometimes I'm hiding away from the madness around me
Like a child who's afraid of the dark

[Chorus: x2]
But when I call on Jesus,
All things are possible
I can mount on wings like eagles' and soar
When I call on Jesus,
Mountains are gonna fall
'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue me when I call

Weary brother, broken daughter,
Widowed, widowed lover, you're not alone
If you're tired and scared of the madness around you
If you can't find the strength to carry on

[Chorus]

Call Him in the morning, in the afternoon time
Late in the evening He'll be there
When your heart is broken,
And you feel discouraged,
You can just remember that He said
He'll be there

[Chorus: x2]",Call on Jesus
Gloria Loring,"What would you think if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you?
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

Yes, it's a chance that we're taking
And somebody's heart may be breaking
But we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

I've been through you
And you've been through me
Sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
We always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
Well, I know in our heart we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Other",Friends and Lovers
Gloria Loring,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Gloria Loring,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door 
I'm taking the time for a number of things 
That weren't important yesterday 
And I still go 

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go",Fixing a Hole
Gloria Loring,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Gloria Loring,"Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems like the natural thing to do
Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

And I hope that deep inside you feel it too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky lit with diamonds
When I make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will feel brand new
Tonight we will both discover 
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

Gloria Lynne,"Blackbird, blackbird singing the blues all day
Right outside of my door
Blackbird, blackbird who do you sit and say
There's no sunshine in store

All through the winter you hung around
Now I begin to feel homeward bound
Blackbird, blackbird gotta be on my way
Where there's sunshine galore

Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she

No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye

I've been longing for you
Bluebird bluebird what do I hear you say
Skies are turning to blue

I'm like a flower that's fading here
Where ev'ry hour is one long tear
Bluebird bluebird this is my lucky day
Now my dreams will come true

Pack up all my care and woe

Gloria Lynne,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
Without a song
That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song        
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll        
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Gloria Lynne,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Gloria Lynne,"Many men with lofty aims,
Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

The folks who like to be called,

Gloria Lynne,"If I expected love when first we kissed,
Blame it on my youth.
If only for you I did exist,
Blame it on my youth.

I believed in everything,
Like a child of three;
You meant more than anything,
All the world to me!

If you were on my mind all night and day,
Blame it on my youth.
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray,
Blame it on my youth.

If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth,
Don't blame it on my heart,
Blame it on my youth.

Gloria Lynne,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognise the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be

Gloria Lynne,"If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!

Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you

Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble,

Run when church bells ring.
It could happen to you 
All I did was wonder 
How your arms would be
And it happened to me",It Could Happen to You

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine

People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

Getting right down to the XYZ of it 
Help me solve the mystery of it

The sky's a blackboard high above you 
And if a shooting star goes by 
I'll use that star to write ""I love you"" 
A thousand times across the sky 

One thing isn't very clear my love 
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love 
Graduation's almost here my love 
You'd better teach me tonight 

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two 
And I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two 
Hey teach me tonight 

I who thought I knew the score of it 
Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey teach me tonight 

The midnight hours come slowly creeping 
When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping 
Single in a bed for two 

What I need most is post graduate 
What I feel is hard to articulate

Gloria Lynne,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire
Gloria Lynne,"I have given you my true love,
But you love a new love.
What am I supposed to do now
With you now, you're through?
You'll be on your merry way
And there's only this to say:

I'm through with love
I'll never fall again.
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you or no one
Because I'm through with love.

I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there.
I have stocked my heart
With an icy, Frigidaire.
For I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love.

Why did you lead me
to think you could care?
You didn't need me
for you had your share
of slaves around you
to hound you and swear
with deep emotion, devotion to you.

Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me
It could never bring the things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one
So I am through with love.

Gloria Lynne,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World
Gloria Lynne,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Gloria Lynne,"Seems that I read, or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find

I took a trip on the train
And I thought about you,
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue,

I peeked through the crack
And looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do
I thought about you",I Thought About You
Gloria Lynne,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Gloria Lynne,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all

While there's a bird to fly

Gloria Lynne,"Many men with lofty aims,
Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

But I don't because, you see
I have loved and I have learned
And as far as I'm concerned

I should care
I should go around weeping

How sweet a kiss could be
I would have said, ""Impossible,
Impossible for me""

I would have said, ""Impossible,
Impossible, my friend.""

Is strange enough for me

Gloria Lynne,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Gloria Lynne,"So I walk a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast,
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk;
Oh, I believe in you,

And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart,
I've got to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart,

And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrific'ly too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick ev'ry time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Gloria Lynne,"Princess cards she sends me with her regards
Oh, barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
To her Cheshire smile, I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted
Oh, but you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts
Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back
You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks
You said, here's your mirror and your ball and jacks
But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too

I came for you, for you, I came for you
But you did not need my urgency
I came for you, for you, I came for you
But your life was one long emergency
And your cloud line urges me
And my electric surges free

Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak
Oh reveal yourself all now to me, girl, while you've got the strength to speak
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks
But I could give it all to you now, if only you could ask
Oh, and don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's too late
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate
Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back
You and your pony face and your Union Jack
Well, take your local joker and teach him how to act
I swear I was never that way, even when I really cracked
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
You could laugh and cry in a single sound

And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the God?

You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek
Yeah, that ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?
And you should know that's true

I came for you, for you, I came for you
But you did not need my urgency
I came for you, for you, I came for you

Sun was shinin' fine,
The lady love of old Bill Bailey
Was hangin' clothes on the line
In her back yard,
And weepin' hard.
She married a B&O brakeman
That took and throwed her down,
Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd,
She hollered loud:

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home?

I'll pay the rent,

'member that rainy eve that
I threw you out,
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?
I know I'm to blame,
Well, ain't that a shame

In an automobile,
A great big diamond, coach and footman
Hear that lady squeal.
He's all alone
I heard her groan.
She hollered through the door
Bill Bailey, is you sore?
Stop a minute, listen to me
Won't I see you no more?
Bill winks his eye
As he heard her cry

[Chorus]",Bill Bailey
Gloria Lynne,"It seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know

Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe

Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe",Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe
Gloria Lynne,"Can you read my mind
Do you know what it is you do to me
Don't know who you are
Just a friend from another star

Here I am like a kid at a school
Holding hands with a god, I'm a fool
Will you look at me quivering
Like a little girl shivering
You can see right through me

Can you read my mind
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of
Wondering why you are
All the wonderful things you are

You can fly, you belong to the sky
You and I could belong to each other

If you need a friend,
I'm the one to fly to
If you need to be loved

Gloria Lynne,"Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love, ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will
make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed

They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun
Time, we've learned to sail above

Time, won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen",Evergreen
Gloria Lynne,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for you
It's now or never
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever

I could make you care, you'd never forget me,
I can't resist, I'd be a fool to try,

So I planned my life, it's built all around you,

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
Oh, it's magic

How else can I explain
Those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic, why do I tell myself

Are all really true

Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!
Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Simple cooking means
More than French Cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is
Sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! `Atta boy.

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

Where no pests are pestering
No dear momma holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

Far from life's machinery

A dream for two, there are such things
Someone to whisper ""Darling you're my guiding star""

A rainbow high where heaven sings
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star because there are such things

By the way you treat me boy one day you're gonna lose,

Oh, in and out of my life each day, having everything your way,
But now there's something I've got to say...

I'm giving' all and you're just takin'
I'm in love with you, but that just won't do
You've got a case of too much love makin'
I'm givin' all and you're just takin'
I'm in love with you, but that just won't do.

You don't know it boy but you're hangin' from a limb,
And the odds that you won't fall are gettin' mighty slim,

I don't know what's on your mind, or if you're just killin' time,
I've got to have a love that's for real and mine all mine, oh

Pero tengo de acero la carrocería
Tengo un letrero que si lo prendo
Dice que voy libre para tu vida
Puedo sacarte de algún infierno
Para llevarte al mismo cielo

No soy un pájaro, no soy avión
Pero soy más fuerte que una locomotora
Puedo escucharte, puedes hablarme
Guardo secretos de consejos
Con buena intensión
Y si me cuadras de pasajero
Yo puedo abriste mis sentimientos
Y desahogarnos, ¡salud! con unos tragos
Pues más que hermanos, somos extraños

Libre, libre, libre, libre, libre
Libre, libre, libre, libre, libre
Libre, libre, libre, libre

No soy un pájaro, no soy avión
Pero igual puedo volar por toda la ciudad
Llegar tan alto como tus sueños
Y si me caigo, me levanto
Pero te hago llegar
Y si me cuadras de pasajero
Yo puedo abrirte mis sentimientos
Y desahogarnos, ¡salud! con unos tragos
Pues más que hermanos, somos extraños

Libre, libre, libre, libre, libre
Libre, libre, libre, libre, libre
Libre, libre, libre, libre,
Pa´ delante, dale, dale
De reversa, venga, venga
Golpe avisa, golpe avisa

Tengo un trasero más que bueno
Y una defensa de a deberás
Un peluchito en el tablero
Con perfumito vainillero
Si te lo arrimo y se te para
Mi carrito ruletero no te falla
Yo te llevo a donde quiera
Que tú vayas
¡Arrímenselas!

Por qué el señor me lo quitó

Íbamos los dos al anochecer
Oscurecía y no podía ver
Él manejaba, iba a más de cien

Muy tarde fue al enfrenar
El auto volcó y hasta el fondo
Fue a dar.

Por qué el señor me lo quitó
Se ha ido al cielo
Y para poder ir yo
Debo también ser buena

Al vueltas dar yo me salí
Por un momento no supe de mí
Al despertar hacia el auto corrí
Y aún con vida lo pude hallar.
Al verme lloró, me dijo adiós
Allá te espero donde está dios
Él ha querido separarnos hoy
Abrázame fuerte porque me voy.
Al fin lo abracé
Y al besarlo se sonrió
Después de un suspiro
En mis brazos quedó.

Que eran arrastrados por un perro bien perro
Y ese perro que era todo un animal
Que se lo come el lobo en una navidad

Debo tambien ser bueno para 
Estar con mi amor
Por que se fue, por que murio
Por que el señor me la quito
Se ha ido al cielo
Why para poder ir yo
Debo tambien ser bueno
Para estar con mi amor.
Por que se fue, por que murio
Por que el señor me la quito
Se ha ido al cielo
Why para poder ir yo
Debo tambien ser bueno 
Para estar con mi amor.

Gloria Trevi,"Esto que tú ves
Que escondo aquí adentro
Es parte de una estupidez
Por no usar el cerebro;
Me olvidé de las pastillas,
Los condones me valían,
Todo por la calentura
De querer coger!

No quiero un bebé,
Y menos mantenerlo,
Simplemente me acosté
Porque quería hacerlo
Ahora pienso en el aborto
Y qué tal si me equivoco?
Sé que nunca en la vida
Me perdonaré

Si lo disfruté
Ahora ni me acuerdo,
Fue un momento de placer
Que ahora aborrezco!
Y mi novio se hace menso,
Yo le llamo y no lo encuentro,
Pues resulta que ahora
No me quiere responder

Decirle a mi papá
Que siempre es tan violento,
Y traer un niño más
Sólo aumentara el censo
Él es sólo una criatura
Que jamás tendrá la culpa
De que sea un problema
Para su mamá

Sentirme tan confusa!

Cuando crece mi cintura,
Y también crece el temor
Con ella mes a mes

Nunca da la cara a la noche
Es un vagabundo, aventurero y caprichoso
Es un loco que solo la hará llorar

Sale pero el sol se va a poner

Y hacen el eclipse el la quema, ella se deja
Se le entrega
Sin importarte el que dirán

Pero el final el sol siempre la deja
Cuando el tenga ganas le hablara
Mientras ella aguanta los reproches de la noche
Pues la luna dará a luz por tanto amar

Y la noche tratara de ocultarlo
Al universo Y al espacio
Que su hija fue a pecar
Sin embargo palidecerá la noche
Y se alumbrara la tierra
Cuando nazcan las estrellas

Que ya no te impresiona la vida

En la nota roja de la televisión
Estoy mirando la nota roja de la televisión

Dejar mi vida hecha pedazos, rebanarme las venas o que leas mi diario.
Y a  ver quien saca mi ultima foto morbosa en un diaria

Por tener que firmarle

Que es el amor lo que hace el mundo girar

Con una chava de unos veintidós
Le puso un depá y nunca más volvió

Que el bueno siempre al malo ganará

Soy de fuego, Fuego con Fuego
Eh Eh

Que ironía fue encenderme así, con el din-don de las campanas.
Enterraste un cerillo en mi
Me queme el alma

Las llamas no me dejan ver, si en cenizas quedare
Que mas me da aun si en fuego.
Con el viento a mi favor y contra toda
Predicción, Tu por mi hoy estas ardiendo

Cuando el amor prende y ambos perdemos el control,
Es un duelo fuego con fuego,
Y al chocar los besos todo queda en una explosión,
es un duelo fuego con fuego.

Tu lo iniciaste, Tu te incendiaste te has deslumbrado,
Te vez acabado
Tienes que aceptarlo te has enamorado de mi, en un duelo
Fuego Con Fuego

Eh

Lo quemabas todo por ahí.
Por un instante es tan extraño así.
Tu sentiste algo inflamable en mi,
Pero ya voy tarde con lumbre en el aire.

Las llamas no me dejan ver, si en cenizas quedare
Que mas me da aun si en fuego.
Tu y yo fundiendo nos amor
Nada nos separara

Cuando el amor prende y ambos perdemos el control,
Es un duelo fuego con fuego,
Y al chocar los besos todo queda en una explosión,
es un duelo fuego con fuego.

Tu lo iniciaste, Tu te incendiaste te has deslumbrado,
Te vez acabado
Tienes que aceptarlo te has enamorado de mi, en un duelo
Fuego Con Fuego

No trates mas no se apagara,
No podrás evitar
Atrapados por la gravedad
haznos ya impactar somos reacción nuclear

Eh, Ah,

Que un instante y,malva? mirada brillando en tus llamas
Fuego Con Fuego

Cuando el amor prende y ambos perdemos el control,
Es un duelo fuego con fuego,
Y al chocar los besos todo queda en una explosión,
es un duelo fuego con fuego.

Tu lo iniciaste, Tu te incendiaste te has deslumbrado,
Te vez acabado
Tienes que aceptarlo te has enamorado de mi, en un duelo

Gloria Trevi,"No me mires raro
Yo estoy de tu lado
Tu eres el que lo ve todo cuadrado

Guárdate esa idea
Mira que te enferma
Mejor acepta cada cual tal cual

Pobrecillo de ti si no quieres vivir
Aceptando colores, probando sabores
Déjate llevar, ven a volar

No hablo de helados
sino de amarnos

Sólo quiéreme así
No quiero un alguacil
Si me persigues aceleraré
Ya sé lo que debo hacer
Esto va por tu salud
Si no me vences úneteme
Víbrame siénteme el corazón
Amor

Mírate ahí de nuevo
Jugando tu juego
Donde tu eres rey de lo correcto

Y yo como siempre tan independiente
Y te desquicia que no sea obediente

No aprietes, no estreses
No pienses que puedes
Cambiarle a mi mundo
Sus nubes doradas

Déjate llevar, ven a volar
No hablo de helados
He la dos


Ya sé lo que debo hacer
Lo que debo hacer

No al alguacil
No al alguacil

Cielo te quiero a ti y te quiero tan feliz
Como en mis sueños junto a ti

Pero si yo soy yo, soy yo
Y si no soy yo, no soy no
Pues ni hablar, ni llorar
Búscate otro plan


Sólo quiéreme así no quiero un alguacil
Ya sé lo que debo hacer, esto va por tu salud
Si no me vences úneteme
Sólo quiéreme así, no quiero un alguacil
Ya sé lo que debo hacer, esto va por tu salud",No al Alguacil

Camuflaje de mujer
Escondere a la que se porta muy bien
Antifaz pasional
Y ahora si a portarme mal

Me despeino con el viento
Acelero, voy sin frenos
Por las calles de la ciudad

La noche
A veces me quiere, otras me desconoce
Pero vale el riesgo por esos momentos
De los que luego yo ya no recuerdo

Y es que la noche
Tiene sus rincones para los amantes
Donde se confunden algunos rufianes
Que si me persiguen me dejo atrapar

Luego escapo, acelero
Voy sin frenos por las calles, de la ciudad

Otra vez, jugare a vivir sin un despues
A sentir, sin temer
A lo que digan de mi
Atreverme a buscar
El principio o el final

Contra el tiempo, voy que vuelo
Acelero, voy sin frenos
Por las calles de la ciudad

Y en lugar de correr te acercas y me abrazas
Y con el primer aliento me pides un beso
Voy a pensar que algo te pasa.

Si sabes que hablan de mí, que tengo mala fama
Y en vez de irte de aquí tú por mí das la cara
Y dices que para ti los demás no te importan
Voy a pensar que algo te pasa.

Puede ser amor, amor, amor entrando a mi casa,
Tal vez es amor, amor, amor en tu corazón
Sólo de pensar en tú y yo y una casita junto al mar
Llena de sol,
Será que ahora algo a mí me pasa.

Si para desayunar casi no tengo nada:
Dos rebanadas de pan, algo de mermelada
Y con tu mejor mirada dices que te encanta
Voy a pensar que algo te pasa.

Puede ser amor, amor, amor entrando a mi casa,
Tal vez es amor, amor, amor en tu corazón
Sólo de pensar que tú y yo podríamos juntos caminar
Hacia al altar,
Será que ahora algo a mí me pasa.

Sabes que no tengo dinero, que no tengo remedio,
Que no puedo cambiar
Y aunque no soy una modelo parece que buscas mi felicidad
Y todo el día te veo y no me lo creo que seas verdad.

Puede ser amor, amor, amor entrando a mi casa,
Tal vez es amor, amor, amor en tu corazón.
Puede ser amor, amor, amor en cada mañana,
Seguro es amor, amor, amor en cada rincón

Que cene en mi mesa, que sueñe en mi almohada,
Ay yo necesito, que suba en mi cuerpo,
Que se mueva y me bese me muero de ganas.

Me canse de inventar, de jugar siempre sola,

Gloria Trevi,"Tengo tanto miedo
De que olvides lo que te quiero
Y de que con el paso del tiempo
Lo dejes todo en el recuerdo

Tengo tantísimo miedo
Ya casi te vas y yo aun no me atrevo
Tanta precaución que no acude el deseo
Cuidando no salir lastimada me quedo sin nada

Tengo planeado en mi mente
Como robarte tus besos para siempre
Tiene que dar resultado
Voy a amarte tanto
Que de pronto te veras llorando

Voy a darte lo que a nadie le di
Vestida de azúcar un dulce para ti
Te voy a derretir en el calor de mi voz
Te quitare el aliento y no me dirás adiós

Voy a hacerte lo que a nadie le haré
No importa lo que pienses me arriesgare
Y aunque se que las llevo de perder
Prefiero dar un salto a lo desconocido
En un instante vivido
Me moriré o lo lograre

Ya no seré precavida
Total si te vas déjame una sonrisa
Puede doler el recuerdo
Pero lo prefiero a no quedarme siquiera con eso

Tengo planeado en mi mente
El acto perfecto para retenerte
Voy a vencer a mi miedo
Ahora sentirás lo que puedo causar cuando quiero

Voy a darte lo que a nadie le di
Vestida de azúcar un dulce para ti
Te voy a derretir en el calor de mi voz
Te quitare el aliento y no me dirás adiós

Voy a hacerte lo que a nadie le haré
No importa lo que pienses me arriesgare
Y aunque se que las llevo de perder
Prefiero dar un salto a lo desconocido
En un instante vivido, me moriré o lo lograre

Cristales de azúcar reflejan la luna
Lagrimas de alivio te muestran caminos
Un paso mas cerca la escarcha se quiebra
No tiemblo de miedo sino, de lo que te quiero

Voy a darte lo que a nadie le di
Vestida de azúcar un dulce para ti
Te voy a derretir en el calor de mi voz
Te quitare el aliento y no me dirás adiós

Cálida brisa en tu piel
Fresca cascada

Y yo te di los colores de un bosque en abril
Y mis frutas de un busto sutil,
Una estrella de mar y mi aroma de tierra mojada

Y a ti, te dio por volverme cenizas,
Por arrancar de raíz tanta vida,
Por contaminarme del cielo hasta el suelo
Corrompiendo el aire hasta hacerlo veneno

Y ahora te sorprendes,
Con el trueno de mi voz,
El diluvio de mis ojos
Y mi amor en extinción

Y ahora te sorprendes,
Por que todo se acabo,
Te sacude un terremoto,
Ahora que te digo adiós
Fuiste tu, no fui yo!

Pues yo te di una aurora para compartir,
Una estrella para pedir un deseo para ti,
No había nada que yo te negara.

Y a ti, te dio por hacerme pedazos,
Por ensuciarme el futuro el pasado,
Por contaminarme del cielo hasta el suelo
Corrompiendo el aire hasta hacerlo veneno.

Gloria Trevi,"Sabes que para ti soy fantástica, sabes que por tu amor fui polémica 
Sabes que yo soy como un bambino que sabe a mujer con los años, enfréntalo 
Sabes que para ti soy magnética, sabes que como yo nadie encontraras 
Sabes porque yo soy en tu vida algo mágico, intimo, único, cálido 
Amor ¿dónde quedo tu corazón? ¿A dónde se fue tu atención? 
Si todo tienes conmigo y yo estaba contigo porque me apartaste
Amor que fue lo que te trasformo si el viento sopla a tu favor 
No esperes a que sea tarde, conquístame, ámame, encuentra lo que se perdió 
Sabes que no puedo ser patética, sabes que aunque duela soy autentica 
Sabes que sobrara quien me quiera y si tú no te esmeras pierdes a tu reina 
Lo sabes que lloraras por mi ausencia, lo sabes 
Así que toma las riendas y hazme sentir que eres en mi vida algo mágico, intimo, único, cálido

Si todo tienes conmigo y yo estaba contigo porque me apartaste

Lo que no sabes es que a mi lado es más larga la primavera 
Y que el otoño con mi amor es más dorado 
Y que el invierno tiene el fuego de mi abrazo 
Lo que no sabes, lo que no sabes que en tus batallas soy escudo que te cuida 
Que en tus heridas soy eso que cauteriza 
Que no hay derrota que haga que yo no te siga 
Lo que no sabes, lo que no sabes es lo que pierdes si me pierdes, pierdes tanto

Gloria Trevi,"El amor es un rayo de luz indirecta
Una gota de paz
Una fe que despierta
Un zumbido en el aire

Un punto en la niebla
Un perfil
Una sombra
Una pausa
Una espera
El amor es un suave rumor que se acerca
Un timbre a lo lejos
Una brisa ligera

Una voz en la calma
Un aroma de menta
Un después un quizás un haber
Una meta
El amor va brotando entre el aire y el suelo
Y se palpa
Y se siente

Y hay quien puede verlo
Y hace que te despiertes y pienses en el
Y te llama despacio rozando tu piel
El amor te hipnotiza te hace soñar
Y sueñas y cedes y te dejas llevar
Y te mueve por dentro
Y te hace ser mas
Y te empuja y te puede y te lleva detrás

Y de pronto te alza te lanza te quema
Hace luz en tu alma
Hace fuego en tus venas
Y te hace gritar al sentir que te quema
Te disuelve te evapora te destruye te crea
Y te hace viajar en el filo del tiempo 
Remontando los ríos en mil universos
Y te lleva a la gloria y te entrega a la tierra
Y te mira y te ve y piensa y piensa

Y de pronto el amor es la luz de una llama.
Que se empieza a apagar y se va y se apaga.
Es la isla pequeña perdida en la niebla.
Una gota un no se

Una mancha
Una mueca
El amor es la hoja caída en la tierra
Un punto en el mar
Una bruma que espesa
Un pelo en el alma
Un sol que se vela
Un por que?
Un segundo
Un ya no

Una queja
El amor va bajando

Peldaño a peldaño
Con las manos cerradas
Y el paso cansado
Te pregunta quien eres?
Para hacerte saber
Que apenas te conoce
Que que quieres de el?
El amor te hace burla se ríe de ti
Mientras tu sigues quieto sin saber que decir y deseas seguirle
Y decirle que no
Que se quede que vuelva
Que comete un error
Y el amor desbarata tus grandes ideas
Te destroza te rompe
Te parte te quiebra
Y te hace ser ese que tu no quisieras
Y te empuja a ser malo
Y te deja hecho mierda
Y te arroja de bruces
Al ultimo infierno
Arrancándote el alma
Pisandote el cuerpo
Y te ahogas de ancias de volver
A la nada
Y de pronto
Separa y te ve y se apiada

Es mi sueño, es mi fiesta, es mi alegría

Sabe dar y pedir a la mujer

About midnight, he tells her
I ain't got no come-on lines

Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn’t scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight

You couldn’t see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall

So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you

And now that I’ve kissed you

I turned off the car
ran through the yard
back to your front door

Still hangin' in my closet

I don't wanna see you

Down to see the water in the full moon sky

Spent the next four years just singing my songs
With Rosie in the front row singing along
Till I got that call, had to hit that road
Man, how am I gonna leave my Carolina Rose

Yeah the big time is everything I ever wanted
But the spotlight can’t hold a candle to you
Standing up here on this stage, they all say “man, you got it made”
They don’t know, it don’t mean a thing without my Carolina Rose

Met a California girl on a west coast run
She sparkled like a diamond in the setting sun
They called me crazy when I let her go

I hope I ain’t too late
And I hope that you’re still thinking about me too

It’s been five years baby, but it feels like more
Well let me drive you down that blue creek road

I dug myself into a hole, I was feeling out of rush but lost my soul.
So goodbye, city of angels, I left my angel back at home.

Now I know that everything I need is in your eyes,
And the grass ain’t greener on the other side.
Oh, I can’t believe I haven’t said goodbye,
Had to get it all wrong just to get it back.

You've got, you've got what I need,
You've got, you've got what I need.

A thousand miles left behind, the bridges crossed and the mountains climbed
The only thought that crossed my mind was winning you back and making you mine.
So goodbye, city of angels, I left my angel back at home.

Now I know that everything I need is in your eyes,
And the grass ain’t greener on the other side.
Oh, I can’t believe I haven’t said goodbye,
Had to get it all wrong just to get it back.

You've got, you've got what I need,
You've got, you've got what I need.

You’ve got everything I’m ever gonna want,
Ain’t gonna rest ‘till I’m back in your arms.
You’ve got everything I’m ever gonna need,
If you take me back I ain’t never gonna leave.

You’ve got everything I’m ever gonna want,
Ain’t gonna rest ‘till I’m back in your arms.
You’ve got everything I’m ever gonna need,
If you take me back I ain’t never gonna leave.

Now I know that everything I need is in your eyes,
And the grass ain’t greener on the other side.
Oh, I can’t believe I haven’t said goodbye,
I had to get it all wrong just to get it right.

I've been thinking
I can't keep rolling like a broken stone
I've been praying
Lord don't let me
Walk through life empty and alone

No one ever loved me like you do
You know I've been let down a time or two
I was all but lost, I was nowhere bound
You came along and turned my world around

Ooh

You've been patient,
You've been honest
You asked for nothing but a hand to hold
You've been fearless
When you whisper
A simple promise worth its weight in gold

No one ever loved me like you do
You know I've been let down a time or two
I was all but lost, I was nowhere bound
You came along and turned my world around

One kiss, one touch
One look could say so much
One dream, so right
Two hearts are one tonight

We've been tested
We've been lucky
We found each other in this endless crowd
We've been blessed
Our search is over
Forever starts right here, right now

To that little red house on Oakmont Drive
Next to that big magnolia tree
A wide-eyed girl running wild and free, that's me
Me and my brothers in the Georgia sun
Runnin' through the yard with the sprinklers on
Lazy dog lyin' in the cool green grass
Never thought life would fly so fast, it don't last

I still hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home
Where the love grows pure and strong
That's where my heart
That's where my heart belongs

Skippin' stones and kickin' cans
Stealing my first kiss by the lemonade stand
I can't forget those southern nights
Falling stars and fireflies, felt so right

I still hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home
Where the love grows pure and strong
That's where my heart
That's where my heart belongs

Those family days are all but gone
Everybody moved out, everybody's moved on
When I'm all alone and feeling like
I'm stuck in the middle of this crazy life
I just close my eyes

And I can hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home

A simple melody calling me back home

I said whatcha want, she said, whatcha think?
I took a sip and we were slipping away
To a little corner table to the left of the stage

It was just some random night in July
No there wasn't no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing, we were just having fun
Next thing you know

(Three, two, one) We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pockets
Sun coming up couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being
The best night ever

We were there, till they closed down the bar
Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watch the stars fade out, my head on your shoulder
Saying baby please don't let it be over
I've been living all over this town, trying to recreate it
But I never found, whatever it was, whatever we had,
No nothing no, nothing's gonna ever top that

We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pockets
Sun coming up couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)

Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'

But just like that, 3-2-1

Summer flames never turned into anything much
We met on an August night at a lake house of a buddy of mine
The first kiss didn't miss but it wasn't enough
And I said

The water's still warm, baby
There's still something in the air tonight

Got a whole lot of time left
There's still so many sunsets

Don't make a fuss

Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there

Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!

You know I do.

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul!

Christine I love you!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing

One lifetime say the word and I will follow you

Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin

Hunchback creep and he's bangin' on the bells
Big black dog sittin' at my door
Automatic thrill and I want it some more

Add a helicopter noise add some freaky lookin' boys
Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin
Got me runnin' down an alley, full of hate and melancholy
Got me suckin' on a bitter pill, sucker for the big kill

You feel where I'm coming from
Have no fear
Everything's is fine
My girl parties
All the time

Did you hear what I said
With this ring I do wed
A body in my bed
She was cool when I met her
But I think I like her better
Dead

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Hahahaha

The production is progressive
But the reason is retro
The cause of cold blooded murder
I named it neo-necro
I whisper in her ear 
To hear an echo
Echo, co, co
I keep her
It's cheaper
I love too much to let go
We discussed over dinner how she would die
Before the day was done
So I caught her just in time to have a little fun
And you could use a little sun
So scream and holler
Run and play
Wish you could die
Another day

Come back to see this house
Done what I could to revive
My soft side survived
Man
Thought you was alright 
And she was alive

What did you say
Oh did you walk or did you run away
Where are you know
Where have you been
Did you go alone or did you find a friend

I need to know this
'Coz I noticed I'm just smiling
How can the sun
Have any fun
Feeling free

And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smiling for me

So what went right
What went wrong
Was it a story or was it a song
Was it over night
Or did it take you long
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong

For all the above
Oh how I love to see you smiling
An oh yeah
Take a little pain just in case

You need something want to embrace
To help you put on a smiley face
Face
Smiley face

Don't you go off into the new day without getting down
Here's a summary of something you get sad about
Say for instance my girlfriend she, bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time
Oh see

I believe
Whenever I see you smiling
'Coz excuse me
But it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smiling at you

As I'm not there

That you don't have to be grown to go
I could have died so long befo'

I can smile at it now, I feel better
Oh, better!
And even a little is still better

Oh it's probably plain to see
That I got a whole lot of pain in me
And it will always remain in me
So cold, it's a cryin' shame
Yet here I am, tryin' again
Cause I refuse to die in vain

And there ain't no holdin' me

And when adversity comes again
I'll deal with it then

Who's gonna save my soul now
Who's gonna save my soul now
How will my story ever be told now
How will my story be told now

Made me feel like somebody
Like somebody else
Although he was imitated often
It felt like I was being myself

Was totally and completely depended on

I may be just a little selfish
All I have is the memory
Yet I never start to wonder
Was it possible you were hurting worse than me
Still my hunger turns to greed

I think it was last year on my birthday when you broke the news
Things ain't rollin' how we need them to and we have to move
But I said, ""Dad, get those moving boxes out the room""
And cut the cake, I'll get it, I got it, I'll give my all for you
Too many memories and feelings I'm not down to pack
So lately I've been putting all this weight up on my back
I know that's never what you wanted dad, but understand
We can't afford another heart attack to keep the fam intact
It's whatever as long as we stick together
This shit's forever, above us there's nothin' better
Do you remember when you said ""Do what you love
And don't give up, it's in your blood""
That's when you taught me that
If all I have is me, then all I need is family
If all I have is home, then all I am is happy
I may not know it all but I know this
Home isn't where you are, it's who you're with and it...

So no matter where we go, we're not alone
Why fix something if it isn't broke?
You call it holding on, I call it hope
I'm not tryna make my sister move or tryna change my momma's mood
So I got all this shit to do to make sure movin's not the move
'Cause lately I've been feeling all this pressure within
But one day we gon' all be back together again
So for now I'm on my grind, workin' all the time
Sending all these dollars, dimes to you
When I'm out there on the road, you can always hit my phone
So I'm always right there next to you
Now I'm missin' all these birthdays
Just to put my family in a good place
'Cause that's all that I wanted in the first place
'Cause I only do it for my family

You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings

Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you'll never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

Go Radio,"And don't go to bed yet, love,
I think it's too early
And we just need a little time to ourselves
And don't go to bed yet, love,
I think it's too early,
And we just need a little time to ourselves.

If my wall clock tells me that it's four
In the morning,
I'll give it hell.

'Cause I've been trying way too long,
To try and be the perfect song,
When our hearts are heavy burdens,
We shouldn't have to bear alone.

So goodnight moon,
And goodnight you,
When you're all that I think about.
All that I dream about.
How'd I ever breathe without

A goodnight kiss
From goodnight you,
The kind of hope they all talk about.
The kind of feeling we sing about.
Sit in our bedroom and read aloud,
Like a passage from goodnight moon

And sing for me softly, love,
Your song for tomorrow
And tell me my name's the one sitting in there somewhere

And dream for me anything, but dream
It in color about
We know the sun's still rising but we don't care

'Cause I've been trying way too long,
To try and be the perfect song,
When our hearts are heavy burdens,
We shouldn't have to bear alone.

So goodnight you,
And goodnight moon,
When you're all that I think about.
All that I dream about.
How'd I ever breathe without

A goodnight kiss
From goodnight you,
The kind of hope they all talk about.
The kind of feelings we sing about.
Sit in our bedrooms and read aloud,
Like a passage from goodnight moon

From goodnight moon

Then there you were,
And I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs.
It's hard to miss,
The way her eyes light up the room,
And steal the air.

Just feel her lips,
Lock on to every breath I take;
Can't breath it in.

Do you feel us falling?

'Cause I feel us falling

So goodnight moon,
And goodnight you,
When you're all that I think about.
All that I dream about.
How'd I ever breathe without

A goodnight kiss
From goodnight you,
The kind of hope they all talk about.
The kind of feeling we sing about.
Sit in our bedrooms and read aloud,
Like a passage from goodnight moon

Oh, from goodnight moon

And there you were,
And I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs.
It's hard to miss,
The way her eyes light up the room,
And steal the air.

Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling

Do you feel us falling?

Do you feel us falling?

It's leaving the taste of something bitter on my tongue
I'm leaving a letter full of reasons along with a line that starts to blur
Into a page that says you faded way too young

'Cause you're leaving something short of innocent
I'm still thinking of the times we should of spent
It's as if this form of treason crawled up deep inside your head
And left you notes on how to keep your insides dead

If I had any other heart if any other piece spoke louder
If I had any other hands I wouldn't need the voice to tell
The world about the coward that refuses to stand and claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other heart beside my own we might have left you cold

'Cause I've been this awful shade of lonely since your reasons left the room
And I'd see everything get warmer if you decide to follow suit
If I could paint the town with all your good intent
I'd leave these walls as red as my eyes could have been
While picking comfort for my Father for a place to rest his head

If I had any other heart if any other piece spoke louder
If I had any other hands I wouldn't need the voice to tell
The world about the coward that refuses to stand and claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other heart, if I had any other heart beside my own

If I were king of the world and I could build you a day
I'd smile just to rip it all away
I would to blaze a memory in your head that screams about regret.

As you think about the way you hope she thinks about your days
That you don't find the words to say

And then you lay there wide awake

And not show off our scars not leave here with doubts that

May they glow like a coal
And keep passion inside us
Reminding though young and in love we're all fools
But the time that we spent
In arms and in longing
Can rewrite the pages our fathers left here
From a passage of hope and an act of conviction
To letters unsigned and unsent out of fear

Will we throw this all away
Or keep pace with a stride that stays even with mine

Have you painted walls with all the answers
Have you hidden doors with all our fears

And they'll bleed bright red with scribbled riddles
Scratched out of their panels by angered air

And if I drown alone it's 'cause I choose
To spend my time drinking in the stairwells

I'd be alright it's what we need but especially me

In the back of a closet
Written by a child's hand
On pieces of parchment
Yellowed and old
I've never seen
That kind of belief

I sat to read
A story of kindness
Where even just one kiss
Can change how we read this
Can help us get lost
In a pattern so ageless
It conquers the cost

When did we all resolve to growing up means stand aside
Where did the heroes go 'cause tonight we breathe to stand and fight

We will run
Until we all can feel the sun
Until we all can bleed as one
Until we all collapse
We'll always live to close the distance
Run
Like it's time that's chasing us
Like you will never find enough
Like you forgot the words ""give up""
And live to close the distance

Can you say
You remember a time when
All you had was a dream and
A promise to fight
When you were sure you were gone
When there wasn't the hope to carry on

Well in these days
We can live with a passion
We only deserve when
We cherish the burden
Of the brothers beside
When we carry the bones
That can't walk on their own

When did we all resolve to growing up means stand aside
Where did the heroes go 'cause tonight we breathe to stand and fight

Like you will never find enough
Like you forgot the words ""give up""
And live to close the distance

I will sing like everyone is listening
Like current company
Thinks the words we speak right now mean everything
Like we all should feel the sun
Until we all can bleed as one
Until we all collapse
We'll always live to close the distance

Is that how he came around
For his child he'll know now
'Cause he left him with bruises
His words just abusive
The love he didn't show
And what his boy was going through
He had never imagined
But when love turns to hate
It's the worse out of passion
His son was bold
And by then it was too late
From his friend they get console
Then his hands, his shoes
The life or death they couldn't hold
Oh, two seconds cold
He was fourteen years old
Locked up until he's old

Creeps upon me I can't deny
That I'm blue,

A love I never knew,
Still I'm bound to you.

Won't settle in me somehow, I'm not free.

(I mean what are you saying then, damn)

That it could be different

What if where this is turning
This isn't meant to be
We used to get lifted
The love we craved it so insatiably
And lately I've been missing all the little things

Maybe I got comfortable with the way you was treating me
Hot meals cooked up, way you would feed me
I'm selfish, how could I let my fear defeat me
Scared of something different, and I see you complete me
But ay I don't like to argue a bit
I promise I'll change if I ain't gotta hear your lip
Oh I'm sorry, I'm saying
But you don't respect
You don't listen you're no different

I know we can make it better baby

And still this distance seems to grab a hold
I miss you so and making love still feels like coming home
We fuss we fight I leave
You might but then you make it right
But still at night I can't stand the sight of you not in my life

That it could be different

His dad so bold, so full of lies
Caught up in things that would take his life

He'd leave behind old words unsaid
His loved ones left to deal with it
When his boy got older with less than enough guidance
Needed more assurance, a little strength and courage

But if he knew what he knows now
He may be with us still
If he knew what he knows now, oh

To laugh and play should have been what goes
Her family moved from place to place
Free spirits and money they couldn't waste

She'd be alone more times than few
Too many men trusted and out of view
One took her in and used his mind
Scarred her inside and changed her life

So when she had daughters of her own
Her memories could no longer escape her
They affected all the choices that she would make

But if she knew what she knows now
She wouldn't take the blame
If she knew what she knows now

'Bout anything in this world when I saw wrong
I analyze, sometimes cry alone
When it got too much I had a place to turn

All the things you couldn't say

Some don't serve us anymore

I'm feeling you out, nailing you down
You always give me something to wrap my hand around
I made a list of rules today
I'm never gonna be the same
I put you in the back of my mind
When you keep me outta trouble ahead
I'm tired of pushing you down I drag you around
I fall into this trap I could easily get around
I'm breaking it down, but where are you now?
I finally learned my lesson to change my style
Needed piece of mind

Gob,"She creeps into my head
So many mornings
What am I supposed to do
When life gets boring
This fixation with her
It goes much deeper
Than just a photograph
Wish I could keep her
Can't get her off my mind
Happens all the time
I'm tearin' everything down
Oh I should have known better
Oh I should have known better
I watch her shop for clothes
True value vintage
Stare from across the room
She makes her purchase
The wheel inside my head
Has started rolling
It's going to take me away
(It's going to take me away)
Can't get her off my mind
Happens all the time
I'm tearin' everything down
Oh I should have known better
Oh I should have known better
Can't get her off my mind

I'm tearin' everything down
Get her off my mind

I'm tearin' everything down

I'm better off puttin' this behind me
I'm overdrawn
I withdrew
I'm down and out 
And thanks to you

You'll fall ill after hearing this
I can't think straight, I'll mix you up
No recipe no formula
I'm like a chain-saw, I'll spit and sing
The words that cut you limb from limb
Cut out of a pattern to nothing familiar

I went out to find a funeral
No one died, I was waiting
None will rise, dawn is beautiful
Underground I will haunt you

Well it's easy to be with this
Just take some notes we'll take a piss
On all the shit that sounds so typical
We're fully automatic and we will kill
When amnesia sets in again
Forget yourself remember this that
We are so special
We're nothing for real

I went out to find a funeral
No one died, I was waiting
None will rise, dawn is beautiful
Underground I will hunt you down

Si el culpable soy yo
Ya no te molesto, me desaparezco

Beyond my lover's head the moon, I hear the rain

As a tool it's more demure
Than your friend the singing queen
With her matinee good looks

I tell you the way I feel

I will forget the kiss and feel if you will too

But I mostly blame my age
Please make allowances for me

It's a drag that you're getting old
I love to think about the year
When we sobbed and then we cheered
The town deserted like a film
The sun was baking dust for fun
Trees were withering by the day
Your torso crushing me
Into the country and the tunnels and the fields

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will do

But I did not eat
And so the doctor came to me
He said a woman does not live

Trick photography on speed
I was locked inside a room

And on the balcony she quakes
And she is waiting for the sign
And when the brother does not come
And when the sister's much too young, she chooses you",A Down and Dusky Blonde

And maybe someday you will need me but I don't know when
And maybe someday you will free me
And pull me 'cross the borderline again

God Street Wine,"Night, hello
Won't you take me where you think I oughta go
And tell me what you think I need to know
Won't you wrap me up like a baby
And carry me out to the sea
And make me who you think I oughta be

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna catch the last ferry 'cross Lake Champlain
And I'm never gonna play my guitar again
You know that I've tried
But the dream has surely died
And though I didn't get where I wanted to go
I did enjoy the ride

Night, lights out
There's so many things you told me that I doubt
And so many things I'm afraid I might find out
And I think sometimes I'm dreaming
All the fucked up things I've seen
All the crazy things I've said and didn't mean

[Chorus]

You were always a friend to me
But now in the end I see
You never understood what I was saying
And I don't want to see you here no more
And I don't know what you're standin' around for
Can't you see
There ain't no music playing?",Epilog
God Street Wine,"What a crazy night
Wine and smoke filled my head with dreams
You so near
I saw your hands and finger everywhere

Now darling if you're feeling afraid
Don't ask me where I'm taking you
Do you hear? Do you feel the forest around you?
I know it's dangerous in the backlands alone
Just let me tell you what to do
Do you see? Do you know that it's a good thing I found you? 

Six o'clock
And the highway fills up with a thousand cars
Close your eyes
Yes I do believe that you are real
Together we could break through the wall
And drive through at the speed of sound

It's okay, their rays will pass through you
The radar won't pick up a thing
Down in the caverns underground
It's alright, very soon we will be free. 

[Chorus:]
Yes we're going to run away,
Run away to the Fortress of Solitude
It's okay, everything is life-size
We're going to run away
Run away to the Fortress of Solitude,
Build a new world of hate and love...

The sun goes down
Lighting up the dark New Jersey hills
Oh my love
I will be here 'til the end of time
The bombing has begun by now
The city's going down in flames
You must be strong in this weather.

The old world's at the edge of the sea
About to slide into the freezing waves
At least if we die, we're together. 

[Chorus]",Fortress of Solitude
God Street Wine,"It was early in the morning
When I looked up and saw the time
And when I saw who lay beside me
I thought I'd lose my mind

Gretchen smiling in the grey light
Sleeping softly next to me
You looked as though you might be dreaming
So I thought I'd let you be 
I said bye-bye
Girl I love you but I just can't stay
Can you tell me why, why
I got to be a thousand miles away

[Chorus:]
Goodnight Gretchen, I've got to leave you soon
We been lying here since two in the afternoon
Goodnight Gretchen, I must be on my way
But I'm gonna come back
Come back
Girl I'm gonna see you again someday

I looked into your broken mirror
Where I'd never looked before
I waited 'til my mind was clearer
And slipped on out the door

It was early in September
When I began to lose my sight
But you told me if I made it through December
You would put me right
And I said bye-bye
Arizona winters ain't too cold
Can you tell me why, why
Can you tell me why I look so old

[Chorus]

So will you wait for me 'til April
Can you find something to do
And when you drive back to New Jersey
Will you bring me with you?",Goodnight Gretchen
God Street Wine,"Ooh little cousin
See how far you've come
Between the daybreak and the setting sun
Ooh little cousin
See how hard it's been
To hold your head up in the rain and the wind 

And when you close your eyes
Do you feel it all again
And do you realize
This day may never end
And though you don't know when
You'll come home again.

Ooh is there something
You could share with me
As your river empties gently
In the sea
Ooh tin that moment
When your memories fall down from the sky

Are those tears of joy or pain
In your eyes?
And in the blinding light
You will see yourself again
And when you sleep tonight
This dream may never end
And though you don't know when
You'll come home again.
Ooh, you'll come home again.",Home Again
God Street Wine,"Hey young girl staring at me
Smiling so mysteriously
Your eyes so shiny and your lips so red
Do you know this tune playing in my head

Hey Cordelia don't you frown
Though your daddy went crazy and your 
house burned down
I'm gonna make everything alright
I'm singing just for you tonight

I got a tune running through my head and it 
won't go away
Singing to me softly, singing to me day
after day
And I want you darling, and I don't want
nobody but you
We can jam in the daylight, we can jam
the whole night through

'Cause I need someone to turn me on
Someone to wake beside at dawn
Someone to sing my song
And be my Nightingale.
Someone to kiss beneath the moon
And sleep with in the afternoon
Someone to sing my tune
And be my Nightingale.

Your face so fine and your body so shy
England in the rain is no place to be
Go find your lover out across the sea
Girl do you hear the music playing
Do you understand what the singer is saying
And these visions that we both have seen
Baby can you tell me just what they mean?

I got a tune running through my head that I 
want you to hear
Play it for you darling, for your sisters and 
the good King Lear
And I been dreaming of a day when the sun 
will shine again
Shine on through your lightning, shine on 
through your thunder and rain
'Cause I need someone to turn me on

So won't you listen to the band
And won't you try to understand
And won't you let me be your fool
And hold you by the hand
And sing until I see that you are smiling...",Nightingale
God Street Wine,"Feels like a dream as I'm lying on the beach
Staring up at blue sky just beyond my reach
I spread my towel on the edge of a sandy rise
And wait for the girl in green to open her eyes

And someone's shouting far away
But it doesn't matter anyway
I hope the sun don't dry your makeup
And I hope we never make up 

[Chorus:]
We thought the time was right
To get a little rest for you, kid
We tried with all our might
To do the very best for you, kid
We know you need to hide
We know you're somewhere deep inside
So just sit back and wait for the tide
To rise, rise, rise....
Just wait for the tide to rise.

Now the girl rolls over with a sleepy smile
She's programmed to do that every once in a while
He sips his drink and smokes the perfect cigarette
The illusion should last a while yet
And it feels so good to hold her hand
And dig his feet into the sand
Oh, dreaming here beneath the sun
Oh, waiting for the tide to come

[Chorus]

Picking up seashells
Listening for churchbells
Watching the ocean
In a world without motion

We've got so much to teach you
Just let the cool water reach you
And fade away...
Fade away...
Fade away...
Fade away....""",Waiting for the Tide
God Street Wine,"No matter how high I go
I always come crashing down
I'll be up in the sky
And I fall back to the ground
I wake up in the morning, I try and I try
To pull myself together in this crazy town
But some days I wonder why
I always come crashing down

My old girlfriend used to treat me so fine
I couldn't believe that she was mine
Guess I drove her crazy so she left me alone
Too good to be true I should have known

[Chorus:]
Yeah, what else can you say but it's just a cryin' shame?
Yeah, what else can you say but it all turns out the same?
No matter how high I go
I always come crashing down...

I'm gonna go crazy, gonna run through the streets
Gonna scare away everybody I meet
Don't know what is what or who is who
Guess there's noithing left for me to do

Have you heard the news

God Street Wine,"Well I got big ideas goin' through my head
My hands are shakin' I can barely speak
And I'm driving down to the rich part of town
Gonna see a girl there that I met last week

It's a big stone house at the end of the road
And I'll be there soon
Her parents went away for the afternoon
I feel the wind in my hair, the October air
Looks like it might rain but I don't care

And I'm going to see a girl in Brandywine
Today's the day I'm taking her away
I got no money but I got time
She will see she's got to come with me
We're gonna drive West
Yeah we're gonna drive West

They got dangerous mountains with six feet of snow
And fancy statue built by Indians long ago
I got a car that does a hundred-ten without a sound
Come on baby roll up your windows
And let me tell you 'bout the things I found

Like a cool stream in the desert and colored lights flashing
In the skies
Hungry dogs racing through the sand
With black holes in their eyes
They're real alright, I see 'em day and night
Everything looks different in that lonely moonlight

And I'm going to see a girl in Brandywine
Today's the day I'm taking her away

You see it burning in my eyes.
Feel the pressure, on my mind

Got to jump in
Cold shower
Need attention
Of the female kind
I'm completely
Under its power

God Street Wine,"Come everybody to the video night
Where the flames of anger burn green and white
Where the sands are hot and the days are long
And we slouch through the desert half a million strong

Prophets waited for a great revelation
While cameras turned to a ghost of a nation
And a price was paid, and a lesson was learned
While the smoke filled the sky and the hellfire burned.

You can shoot your twin brother at the point of a gun
Though he's already damned for the things that he's done
You can take a big stick, draw a line in the sand,
Take an eye for an eye and a hand for a hand

A young boy's dying and his mother is screaming
While up in the palace an old man is dreaming
And the hellfire twists and the hellfire turns
And whichever way you're lookin' the hellfire burns.

Come on down
Come on down
Come on down to the party in the middle of town
Come on down
Come on down
Come on down, down, down, down, down

Smoke on the water, darkness at noon
A snow-white sun and a black monsoon
Write me a letter, send me a wire
I'll feel much better if we stop the hellfire.

Now we got oil in the oceans, and blood on our hands
And madmen still ruling the desert sands
And the great big wheel of history turns
While the smoke fills the sky and the hellfire burns.

Come on down
Come on down
Come on down to the party in the middle of town
Come on down
Come on down
Come on down, down, down, down, down",Hellfire

When I saw you there
Walking down Seventh Street
With your new funky hair

Did you think it was outta sight?

It worked alright
But then you turned to me and said now I don't want to
See you here
Anymore

Gotta get this straightened out

Been having lots of fun

Hearts all torn up in two

A golden chandelier

Sharp as a knife

Don't you give me a taste and leave me crying for more

God Street Wine,"I remember the sun's clear light
Pushing away the last trace of night
As I awoke on the muddy plain
Fireworks from the night before
Like echoes from a distant war
Rang in my ears and in my brain
And from the hilltop I could see
The ocean sparkling peacefully
The ivory beach's crescent jewel inviting me
Am I the last one left?
Am I the last one left?

And must I ride
To catch the early tide
And walk out, walk out, walk out
Into the sea...

Get down before the shooting begins
Doesn't matter which side wins
In endless rows the bayonets shining
A sole ray of sunlight a moment defining
Shoot! Shoot!

While a seagull winged its anxious way
Across the sky to find a nest

Explosion of anger crystallize
Forgotten inner nature rise
And blacken out the sun

'Til dark among the hundreds left for dead
I chew the leaden bullethead
And turn my toes to the skies
Try to close my eyes

Mother where have you gone
You didn't come home before dawn
And I need to see your face
'Cause I don't know this place
Lover I'm going away

'Til just about dawn
On a drive down I-95
With Molly's snow-white hand in mine,
Chemical factories and halogen lights
And shivers down my spine

Why does this always take me by surprise?
I must confess her sweet caress
Hit me like Cupid's arrow right between the eyes

Molly, oh Molly is it gonna be kind,
Like a corkscrew opening a bottle of wine?

Every day of the calendar we'll be together
Two cats in the cradle, two birds of a feather,
Staring for hours between your green eyes
No mystery, no puzzle, no lies
So many times I've been hurt, so many 
Times I've cried, 
So many times I thought my heart had died.

Why didn't she love me? 
Why don't she care?
And when I look back 
It's just emptiness there.
Some things so fine never last, it seems,
Not lace-filled fantasies, or lingerie dreams.
And everything I know, 
Everything that's true
Comes back in a circle 
Pointing straight to you,

Sweet illusions of the heart
Build palaces out of empty air
And when the palaces fall apart
We cry for what was never there
Molly do you feel my fireworks burning?
Do you feel that nasty old feeling returning?
Love can be crazy, love can be cruel
But I'd rather die a sinner, than a holy fool.

God Street Wine,"When it's late in the evening, no light and no sound
Mind is on empty, defenses are down

And run to you
I'll run to you

I'll hold fast the tiller and pray for the best
And when the storm smashes my raft of bamboo
I'll run to you
I'll run to you

Are an army of soldiers camped out on the plain
They're sleeping in the sun
And the soldiers in the army are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run

The fisherman wakes at the first light of day
He casts out his nets in the calm of the bay
And when he gets lonely in his tiny canoe
He'll run to you
He runs to you

The captain is losing his taste for command
He slaps at mosquitoes with the palm of his hand
His uniform's dirty, his report's overdue
So he runs to you
He runs to you

And all of my dreams and desires for more
Are a navy of sailors washed up on the shore
They're sleeping in the sun
And the sailors in the navy are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run

And all of my clumsy attempts to explain
Are a poor ragtag army marching home in the rain
You can shoot them one by one
And the soldiers in the army are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run",Run to You

And after all our dollar ninety-nine romances

Pretty soon the ice will melt
And the birds will be back in town
Now I'm movin'
But I got nowhere to go
Pretty soon you'll hear from me
Or see me at the show
And after all the times I spied on you undressing
And after all our tender Conoco caressing
And after you had failed to save me
The sky opened up and forgave me

Just one more Sunday that I had to see
That nobody's really what they seem to be
And it so hurts my pride

When I gave up all the things that I thought I knew
When I finally saw that nothing is true
I had nothing to say
And nothing to do...

Showing her sister how she slices the meat
Daddy's on the phone with his first wife
Saying ""I'd like to come home but she cut off my feet""
And it's all going out of control
Little brother fell down a hole
And we can't fish him out, and I have no doubt
That we ain't seen the worst of this heat
Police sergeant come by to call
Shot seventeen holes in the wall
Got mud on the rug in the hall
And said ""That's what I think of your cooking.""
And little brother finally came in from the rain
And in a loud voice began to complain
And he might have been bleeding and possibly in pain
But I don't know, I wasn't looking
Get on the train, wo
Get on the train
And a dog got tired, lay down in a ditch
And said here's what I'll do if I ever get rich
Gonna take off this collar and get me a bitch
And run when my master says ""heel""
And I said you're just a dog, man
And you eat chopped meat from a tin can
And the dog said ""the ditch and the collar are a dream
But the bitch in my head is for real.""
And then we all took the car and went for a drive
And mama trapped tiny flies and ate them alive
And said ""I do what I must in order to survive""
But to me she sounded like she was dying.
And I pulled the car over to the roadside
At the spot I was to marry my new bride
And there she was, stripped naked and hog-tied
Saying ""Boy, stand straight and stop crying.""
Get on the train, wo
Get on the train
So the sun slouched down to the bar and got drunk
And meanwhile the moon was shooting up junk
And me I have in the bottom of my trunk
Some old letters and a dirty magazine.
And now 24 hours a day we got night
And the sun said ""man, it didn't seem right
The pressure of always having to burn so bright""
And I said ""yes, I know what you mean.""
And the train moves on in the dark
We try to make fire from a spark
My new bride dies and mama she cries
Cause the worst kind of stain is from blood.
And it's all going out of control
And a crow on a telephone pole
Looks across the plain and says ""no not again,
I barely survived the first flood.""

Get on the train.",Get on the Train
God Street Wine,"The girl in the car hit the wall at the speed of sound
The sun in the sky woke up, blinked, and turned around
The boy in the dirt fell asleep with his face on the ground
The mother turned over just in time to see her daddy drown
Wo, you can read it in the Daily News
Wo, check the oil and replace the fuse
You ain't right babe
Yer lookin' way too thin
This is war now babe and I'm gonna win
The ringing in her ears got so high no matter what she did
The smile on her face told a lie to the neighbors kid
The picture on the wall of the guy in the rock'n'roll band
Felt a footstep in the hall and the dry touch of baby's hand

God Street Wine,"Maybe lovers stumble towards a silver moon
Talk trivialities, sing out of tune
Bourbon breath, sandy toes in ocean spray
Last summer evening as bright as day
Wary lovers hesitate, drift apart, then meet once more
Two silhouettes on the sandy shore
Maybe fingers press, maybe legs caress
Forgetful tongues their plans confess.
And I lie curled up in the doorstep of the grey sea
And the sky counts possibilities thinking, maybe
Sometimes the stars burn close, within my reach
And sometimes they crash to pieces on the beach
One kiss, an experiment, a test
Damp shirt reveals one button breast
Lovers come together thoughtless at last
Maybe all things possible will come to pass.
Maybe.....
And in the midnight of her dreams
A choice it seems is whispering ""maybe""
And in the gulf of his desire
A voice comes through th fire whispering ""maybe""
And I lie in my reveries
My head upon my knees, thinking ""maybe""
And late at night here on the dune
You can hear the moon, thinking maybe"".",Maybe

Was mistakenly told to come to London
To receive same package from man A
Now man A's train, train 1,
Left 30 mins. late

Left 5 mins early
So when the trains passed each other
Train 1 was travelling at 75 m.p.h.
To make up for lost time
And train 2 was travelling at 52 m.p.h.
Would man A reach Bristol earlier or later
According to his watch

Than man D's would have been
Had he not got off the train
And checked the correct time
At a station between Bristol and London
And stopped to phone A's boss, man see
To double check A would be there to meet him
And discover his mistake
Catch next train, train 3, back to Bristol
Which unlike A's train 1
Which stopped at 4 stations on the way
For 6 mins each stop
Was an express train
D's train caught up with A's train 1

Midnight Sunday asleep on the floor
Curled up in the corner can't take no more
Armies of food invade my sleep
Led by lasagnas ten inches deep
My head is pounding my heart is beating
Cows are mooing sheep are bleating
I'm being haunted by all the meat I've eaten
And then a burglar alarm goes off in my head
And I wake up screaming am I dead or alive
And the clock says five
It's only five in the morning
I'm covered in sweat
Am I hungry? you bet!
Cold turkey's what I'm going through
Cold turkey's what I need
But they hung a sign on my appetite
Saying ""Danger Do Not Feed""
I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I can't eat no more
I can't eat no more
And they've even taken away
The pictures of food I had on my wall
And my treasured collection of menus
They screwed up into a ball
In front of my face they flicked it
Out of the window into the night
But they'll never unscramble the combination
They'll never get it right
Now if they made a feature film
That featured only food
I'd wallow in the crowd scenes
While the rest of the audience booed
And if I got myself a video
I could satisfy the need
I could check out the action frame by frame
And watch the calories breed
But I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I can't eat no more
I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I feel like Kojak sitting in a Cadillac
I gotta eat, I gotta eat a flapjack
A stack, a rack, a six-pack Jack
Just call me Jack Kerouac
Click-clack open up the hatchback
I could eat a Bubble car or a packamack
Pattacake, pattacake Big Mac

Godley & Creme,"I was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so I chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
I felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard I heard a woman''s voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I''m sure I heard a woman''s voice cry

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn''t stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
Then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I picked up an old newspaper to read
and I noticed something very strange indeed
So I looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone
""Woman throws herself from speeding train,
identity unknown""
But I recognized the picture of the woman who was dead
and underneath the picture it said

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb

Godley & Creme,"Samson was a comfortable racehorse
Samson was an easy ride
Samson was born to be a racehorse
Samson gave us a pony and died
And one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson he kicked out the door
Samson he kicked out his light
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
So when the boy pulled the trigger he was ready to go
Here come Delila
She was screaming at the sun
But it's alright
He said it's alright with him
It's alright, it was alright with him
Delila, fell in love in the summertime
But Samson had too much pride
So she loved him
From a distance
She called him black electra-glide
And one day Samson, he turned to the left
Samson he turned to the right
Something was moving through the grass
Something spooky and tight
It was a rattlesnake striking out from the bushes
And Samson was a hero only just in time
Said Delila
I want to be with you forever
If it's alright
And it was alright with him
And it was alright
It was alright with him
They called him Samson
Because his mane was long
And he was carved out of muscle
He was big and strong
We'll build a statue
So he can be with us always
And it's alright
I know it's alright with him
It's alright
I know it's alright with him
Samson grew old in the winter
But Samson still lived for the racing days
But there were rumors
Flying round the racetrack
They were putting him out to graze
So one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson wouldn't wait for the doctor
Samson couldn't live through the night
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
And a bullet would be quicker than a broken heart
And Delila, she was carrying his son
So it's alright
It was alright with him
I know it's alright
It's alright with him
He said it's alright
It's alright with him",Samson

Only last night I found myself lost 
By the station called King's Cross 
Dead and wounded on either side 
You know it's only a matter of time 
I've been good and I've been bad 
I've been guilty of hanging around 

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday

Pop music crackles me to sleep
I tune the dial to Radio Luxembourg
It's better than counting sheep
I wrote away to Radio Caroline
I need to hear your saddest reggae song
And I'll wallow like a zombie in it
Tear up my Ipi Tombi ticket
Let chocolate buttons limbo under my tongue
I've never liked the taste of Lucozade
Another sip of hospital champagne
Charge your glasses ""Radio Luxembourg""
Get well soon
Get well soon

Do they only programme music to accompany my cough
Lousy words and drab percussion
Fading in and out of Russian

Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains
Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail

I wanna stand outside and feel the rain when it falls
Breathe the air on the other side of these walls
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out

Save me a desert, just me and the sand
Save me a sea to sail
In my heart I know I'm too weak to be strong
I've been wasting away in this jail for too long

Save me a mountain for when I get out

Your sacred faded past times
Only time is your enemy.

To prove that your arrogance
Is stronger than you'll ever be.

And comes back around
One rainy day

Oh so many times I should've crawled when I went running by
And since then I've been left feeling traumatized
Raped and drained of an innocence
A gift we've lost over time
And still I gaze through this one rainy day
Alone with no one by my side

Open skies are falling
Tears are coming down

And comes back around, yeah

Never will you ever make me feel this way again, oh

Licking around my neck and making me insane
As they pull me down, pull me down into my grave

Until your deep inside dancing to the Devil's swing
Whoa, it doesn't mean a God damn thing
Dancing to the Devil's swing.

Spit down inside I'm begging for another ride
I'm trying to find a way to keep it all and
Satisfy the needs I'm craving and
I'm not taking it lightly
Oh no!

I'm living inside, a dead lie
Controlled by the Devil's eyes and I don't mind it
Draw my ace up and roll my snake eyes nightly
Hold on baby!

Whoa, it doesn't mean a God damn thing

You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.

When I come home

And some of us fear the end won't come our way

So do ""the right thing"". just do ""the right thing""
How can you do it if you are awake?!

And punk rock 'n' roll most faithfully...

And stick your beak in the seeds your master laid
Where did they came from? Who put them in there?
Oh you will never know their name!
But there is a room where bustle and merry
And big ceremony could be going on,
Where your true talents along with birthrights
Could be dancing can-can

Through ripped out speakers
Through thick and thin
They found a shelter

Still lay ahead of us
How many final frontiers
We gonna mount
And maybe no victory laps
But if you stepped on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin

This is my life and freedom is my profession
This is my mission throughout all flight duration

Gogol Bordello,"Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka, where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where's the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where's the band that like fanfare? Gonna keep it going 24 hour

Instead it's 1 in the morning and DJ's patching up the chords
Everybody's full of cake, staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble that it's time to go
People gotta get up early and they gotta go

Ah, people gotta get up early and she's got a boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going, not even gypsy kings
Nobody talks about my super theory of super everything

So be Donald Trump or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding doesn't end up like this

I understand the cultures of a different kind
But here word celebration just doesn't come to mind

Clinical loneliness backs off

Unseizable diamond from my sling
Still is searching for its ring
In a city of ruins where no one sings

But zombies and willful slaves
Living in their tiny private caves
Crooked hands digging up the graves

You can't fly in this condition
And if no one intervene
Out of the window is my mission

Across my mind is one eternal fight
Inventing new ways to think and see
But keep old friends and answers stir always

To frontiers, my kind is following the spark
To build lighthouse for those who scared of dark
To frontiers where we befriend the shark
And stare at the night but do not see the dark

Of sadness, madness

Here I crawl to rise above
(To rise above)

Oh, what is godless and misleading?

And touch the world

There is this kind of love
I don't know if anywhere in this universe
Someone like you to know, I

And I did see most beautiful of dreams
A cosmic harp where we were the strings
So making sure that the shudder is in tune
To loneliness, we were all immune

To frontiers, my kind is following the spark
To build lighthouse for those who scared of dark
To frontiers where we befriend the shark
And stare at the night to erase the mark
