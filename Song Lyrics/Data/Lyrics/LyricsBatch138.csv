George Carlaw,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
George Chisholm,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

A garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy",If You Were the Only Girl in the World
George Chisholm,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.",Oh! Lady Be Good
George Chisholm,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",Foggy Day

They trade a zero like you for hero like me

George Clinton,"{spoken:}
A luscious bitch she is, true
But it's not nice to fool mother nature
The proud mother of god like all ho's
Is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young Vic Tanny bitch
Who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother
By sucking their brain until their ability to think was amputated
By pimping their instincts
Until they were fat, horny and strung-out
In a neurotic attempt to be queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?

Nineteen ninety three much more be ounce 
Ice Cube comin' with the half ounce

Atomic dog 
Like your behind  heard it through the grapevine 
How much longer will you be mine? 
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama 
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama? 
'cause nothin' but did her damn boogie with my crew 
But I'd rather be with you, boo 
And make you say humdrum, Tweedledee dumb 
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, fuckin' hicks

Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night son 
And hit you with the bop gun

Out of my constriction 
Gonna be freakin' up and down 
Hang up really late

I wants to get (whistle) when I'm chillin'
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in 
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best 
Comin' from the west 
Kickin' them hits 
We occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips 
Hittin' them dips, cd skips but I'm straight 
As I bounce, rock, skate 
Now I'll toast to that 
If it's rough, make the girls say ""Do that stuff! Aw do that 
Stuff!"" 
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week

Do not attempt to adjust your radio 
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong 
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride 
As the buffalo girl go round the outside 
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip 
Got Dayton's on the mother ship 
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass 
The doja on the left hand side for the sale 
'cause nobody knows where the nose goes 
When the ? dog child got the 
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole 
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole

An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Any and every thing I did.
Please, please don't judge me too strong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.""

Then the devil sang

""Would you like to dance with me? (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
We're doin' the cosmic slop."" (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
(x3)

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She says, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Any and every thing I did.
Please, please don't judge me too strong.

Without your face around
You've found another to do your lovin'
Me you have put down

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms

Without your love

I thought was from a leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
See if he could fix the leak

He rushed right in and he took a look
Much to my surprise
He said, my son it's not your sink
It's teardrops from your eye

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks

George Coleman,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining

I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?
They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

And though a million stars were shining

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

George Davidson,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all.
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
you'll find you're all alone; everything has changed.

Play the game; you know you can't quit until it's won.
Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea.
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me.
Just once in his life a man has his time.
And my time is now; I'm comin' alive.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can hear the music playin'; I can see the banners fly.
Feel like a vet again.  I hope I ain't high!
Gonna be your man in motion; all I need is a pair of wheels.",St. Elmo's Fire
George Davidson,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

George Davidson,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

George Davidson,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
George DeHart,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

George DeHart,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

George DeHart,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

George DeHart,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Was I easy to deceive
You were so easy to believe

All your lies somehow left me blind

Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

[Chorus x2]

Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

[Chorus x2]

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

[Chorus x2]

See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches want to know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man

That you can't see your way through

Oh, how about you?
Will you even try not to deny
That that is right with us
Baby hold on, before it's gone, oh

How about you, baby?
Do you say we're through?
Oh, how about you?
Have you moved on, found a new song?

Oh, how about you?
Should we start anew?
Won't you answer me please? I'm down on my knees
Beggin' you to make your move

Do you feel the same or am I insane?
Blinded by cold-hearted love
Is this a game, that both of us lose?

How about you?
Do you feel like I do?

Everyone on the line, no other way to choose
The whole world is in our hands
We can make a better place it's in the
Master's plan
We can do it if we try
And if others ask you why say

It's our world
Far too many just don't care, a living negative
It's our world
And we know right and wrong
But far too many close their eyes and hide
Their fears at home
It's our world
And we must keep our love alive

We've done so much and come so far
But yet we still can't get along and don't
Know who we are
War and pain, I read somewhere
Said they will always be with us until He comes again
Does that mean we shouldn't try
Should I just lay on down and die

Our world
Only world
It's our world, it's a gift

(Celebrate life) we can find a better way
We can change it (rearrange it)
And there's really nothing else to say

It's our world, just keep it goin', do it
It's our world, we better try, honey
It's our world, just show your love
It's our world, don't let it get you down
Keep it goin', just keep it goin', do it

Lovin' this laid back Sunday with you

Smiles across a cool summer glass
Sharing this laid back Sunday with you
Waiting so long
To spend this day with you

Groovin' on this laid back Sunday with you
Checking out the band on the town
Diggin' this laid back Sunday with you

Perfect day with you

George Duke,"Love songs, sweet love songs
Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Hasn't every way to write a love song been written
And hasn't every way to tell the story been told
Hasn't everyone been moved and soothed by the melodies
Aren't there other tales to be told, other stories to unfold

Haven't we anything else to say
Or are we merely trapped to find another way
To say the same things
Don't we have other thoughts, other dreams

Girl it seems every time I search that quiet place
I find myself with you face to face
In my mind there's nothing left to say except, ""I love you""

Love songs, sweet love songs
(I love you)

Hasn't every way to sing a love song been sung
And hasn't every way to phrase the message been done
Haven't all the great ones sung the melodies that've wooed you
And aren't there other songs to be sung with messages untold

Seems that we've lost our will to challenge the mind
And be a unique kind of art it's been for me
Oh a teacher or prophet by pen
Girl but wait, don't get me wrong, I love a good good love song
One that gets me real good, when I close my eyes
I only seem to find the words ""I love you""

""I love you"", girl I can't help myself
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And as long as you keep needin' them
I'll keep servin' 'em till my last breath
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
No, I'm not alone, there're others like you and me
'Cause there's always someone who wants
To tell their story of need

It's a simple story, one as old as time
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And we all know that sometimes
Love don't have no reason or rhyme
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Hingin' on to those love songs

Oh love, oh love, oh love
Love songs, sweet love songs

",Love Songs
George Duke,"Though we push this feeling aside
And though we cry, this can't go on forever
Seasons come and seasons flow and I know
That most things come to an end
But you're so wonderful
Good for me in every way
And I love that message you left on my
Service today

""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you""
Girl, I'm thinkin' about you, too
You've become so special, someone I don't
Want to lose

""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love""
I need you in my life

Sometimes the simple things are the best
Things to say
And sometimes it's what you least expect
That will make your day
And sometimes it's not words at all but a
Glance saying ""I'm okay""
Sometimes a simple ""Hi, it's me"" will set
You on your way
Like a warm breeze
A memory that stays in your head
One that feels so good you'll wish you could
Live it instead

""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you""
Girl, I'm dreamin' about you, too
You're so special, someone, the only one
I choose

""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love""

Never say no, 'cause what you won't do
You do for love, no matter what they say
You'll swallow your pride
Reach down deep inside
And find what is true and what's real

Self respect and the will to rise above
Whatever happened to the right thing to do
Love your brother, let peace abide with you

Whatever happened to live and let live
Tolerance and a willingness to give
Whatever happened to the goodness in a man
Was good ever there or has good lost its hand

Whatever happened to the drive to learn
To better oneself just because one yearns
Whatever happened to the unique voice
The one of a kind giving us a greater choice

Whatever happened to striving towards goals
Seems we're our own worst enemy and foe

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

In a fifty mile race I am the best, I ride five miles and skid the rest.

So come along and see me riding in the T.T. races
Easier than hop scotch, beating all the top notch aces.
I've been riding all my life, I started quite small.
I've ridden fairy cycles, aye, and scooters and all.
Hear the people cheer me when they see me steering backwards.
Down the hill I go at break-neck speed,
See me coming down the street with the winning post on the pillion seat.
Oh! Come along and see me riding in the T.T. race

Come along and see me riding in the T.T. races.

Until I found they'd hitched a charabanc on behind.
Everybody's scaring, I am such a daring rider.
My inside rattles when I go the pace.
My ribs begin to shake about, there's all my spare parts sticking out.

It may be sticky but I never complain, it's nice to have a nibble at it now and again
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

One afternoon the band conductor up on his stand
Somehow lost his baton - it flew out of his hand
So I jumped in his place and then conducted the band
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock

With my little stick of Blackpool Rock, along the promenade I stroll,
In my pocket it got stuck I could tell 
‘Cos when I pulled it out I pulled my shirt off as well
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

A girl while bathing clung to me, my wits had to use
She cried, ""I'm drowning, and to save me, you won't refuse""
I said, ""Well if you're drowning then I don't want to lose
My little stick of Blackpool Rock.""

With my little stick of Blackpool Rock, along the promenade I stroll
In the ballroom I went dancing each night
No wonder every girl that danced with me, stuck to me tight
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

I said when it was done, ""Is that supposed to be me?""

George Formby,"No matter where I go, London, Paris, Mexico.
Anywhere on Earth, they know my place of birth.
I met a girl from London when she sat on Blackpool Pier,
She said she could tell, I'm a Lad from Lancashire.
She said, ""Are you a nudist?"" So I blushed and said, ""No fear"".
I'm covered up like a Lad from Lancashire.

North or South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.
I whispered, ""I'll be nudist if you'll be the same my dear.""
She said, ""No fear, with a Lad from Lancashire.
A widow nice and young and gay said, ""Come to tea my dear,
I've something nice for a Lad from Lancashire.""
We sat down on the sofa and I felt her creeping near,
I said, ""Hee Hee! take care, I'm a Lad from Lancashire.""

North and South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.
The widow started kissing me and tickling my ear,
I tickled her, like a Lad from Lancashire.
I went with Jane down Lovers Lane, she whispered in her ear,
""Now do your best for a Lad from Lancashire.""
She said to me when on my knee, ""You can't do that there ere.""
I said, ""Hey Hey! I can, I'm the Lad from Lancashire.""

North and South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.

George Fox,"Every morning I go out there just a walking
I see that heavy iron marking up this land
There was a time when nobody would've lived here
My dad, he bought a hundred acres for a grand

So the people can get away 
They drive the miles and and get to where they want to be

Well there's no no no trespassing
Well there's no no no trespassing on this land

Yesterday when somebody made a living
Well, less of everything was something that they had
Sometimes I wish that I could turn back the pages
And find a place where I can be an honest man

I climb that hill and watch the bough break baby
Tear it down to make some living room
Somebody sold out thinking they could walk away
But someday, well, they're going to have to say


There's no tresspassing on this land
I just want to keep working these fields, like my old man

Forever I'm yours, for better or worse

Well there goes my span of attention

I got it all figured out in my mind
What I wanna say and today's the day

Play it cool, I got the words ready
She says hello, and here I go

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away

George Freeman,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
George Freeman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Though no a word was spoken.

One look and I forgot the gloom of the past,
One look and I had found my future at last.
One look and I had found a world completely new,
When love walked in, with you.",Love Walked In
George Gershwin,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love
George Gershwin,"The man who only live for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny,
Likewise the man who works for fame,
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is
The only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant.
Fall in love, you won't regret it.
That's the best work of all, if you can get it.
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky

Oh that is nice work if you can get it.
And you can get it, if you try.
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh,
Oh nice work if you can get it.
And you can get it, if you try.

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door.
Where two hearts become one,
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you,
And then taking that vow,
Nice work if you can get it,
And if you get it

Won't you tell me how?

And you can get it, if you try. [Repeat: x4]

George Gershwin,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain girl lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl man I ever think of will regret

I'd like to add her him initials to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she he turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I he may not be the man some girls think of
As handsome to my heart

Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,

George Gershwin,"Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone

Just try my recipe

That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

It's terribly sad, but true
All dressed up, no place to go

I know I'm a winsome miss I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you. So...

Up on the top of a snow-covered mountain
There lived an Alpine miss
And oh, what a sweet little miss was this
We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

And every night just to see this miss
He used to risk his scalp
For the house where she lived was away up high
And the poor guy didn't know how to fly
So he jumped from alp to alp
What a chump (What a chump)
To jump (To jump)
From alp to alp

And then beneath her balcony
He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""
That's the Swiss idea of a melody
And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""
He said, ""How I yearn for you, I burn for you, I do! I do!
Oh, lady, oh, I swear it on my knees
My love for you is just as strong as a piece of Sweitzer cheese""",Swiss Miss

But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part,

With somebody just like you. So...

Oh, lady, be good to me

It was Heaven's plan
There should be a girl for every single man.

George Gershwin,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that man could fly
They told Marconi wireless was a phony, it's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you, said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through, now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy, they laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat, Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie, kept the laughers busy, that's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you, said it would be, ""Hello, Goodbye.""
But oh, you came through, now they're eating humble pie
They all said we'd never get together, darling, let's take a bow

George Gershwin,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

George Gershwin,"Each time you trill a song with Bill or look at Will

For you're a hit where're you flit
I know it's so, but dearie, oh!
You'll never know the blues that go right through me
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues

To Bill and Ben I'd pay attention now and then

Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!
What will I do away from you?
I feel the future will be blue and stormy
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
It may be my heart isn't broken, but there's a bruise.
Through you I've known some days that were lonesome

December was battling with June
But on this bright afternoon
Guess I'll be changing my tune

If I jumped out of a balloon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for?

Wanted a permit to make me a hermit
To grumble and glare at the moon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

No more resentment, I'm full of contentment
Afloat on a dreamy lagoon

Here's what I'm forseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

George Gershwin,"Used to lead quiet existence,
Always had my peace of mind,
Kept Old Man Trouble at a distance,
My days were silver lined!
Right on top of the world I sat,
But look at me now, I don't know where I'm at!

I was doing alright,
Nothing but rainbows in my sky,
I was doing alright
Till you came by!

Had no cause to complain,
Life was as sweet as apple pie,
Never noticed the rain
Till you came by!

But now, whenever you're away,
Can't sleep nights and I suffer all the day;
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder!

But when you're holding me tight,
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing alright,
But I'm doing better than ever now!

George Gershwin,"I've seen for days that you've got
The ways that must be checked
In you I never can detect
The slightest signs of intellect

You're mad on dances, think of the chances you neglect
You never seem inclined to use your mind
And it's quite plain to see
That I'm the brains of the family

I'd rather Charleston

Charleston?

Think of what you might be

I'd rather Charleston

I'm double-jointed

There's no sensation like syncopation

Will you let me know why

I'd rather Charleston

Charleston?

That's the sort of thing I would never do

So, just leave it behind and give your mind to something new

I'd rather Charleston

Oh no

Charleston, Charleston with you

Your way of living soon will soon be giving me a pain
You just repeat that same refrain
You use your feet and not your brain

Something has got you
I don't know what you hope to gain
And after all I've done
It's not much fun to have to have a sister who's
Got her brain in her dancing shoes

When you're older you'll see

I'd rather Charleston

And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away
Happiness, you seem so near me
Happiness, come forth and cheer me

I'm forever blowing bubbles

They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Worthy of a mighty nation,

George Gershwin,"Drop that long face
C'mon have your fling
Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this whole world on a swing

Put on your dancing shoes
Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb

Shall we dance or keep on moping?
Shall we dance or walk on air?
Shall we give in to despair
Or shall we dance with never a care

Life is short, we're getting older
Don't you be an also-ran
You better dance little lady
Dance little man, dance whenever you can

George Golla,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.

Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

George Graham,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
George Graham,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
George Greeley,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream","Laura, song (for the film, ""Laura"")"

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine

Thinking of a mom and daddy that used to rock him on their knees
No more fishing in the creek with daddy no huntin' when the leaves turn brown
Every turn of the wheel seemed to tell him son you gone and let us down
Won't you come on home boy

So blue by the doorstep wondered why he didn't bark

And wander in my words and dream about the pictures that I play of changes

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall to brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die trapped within the circle time parade of changes

Moments of magic will glow in the night all fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes

Passions will part to a warm melody as fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind we're puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes

Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else one last cup of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes",Changes

And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river are the old folks still the same

And by the way did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the homesteam still on fire do they still win all their games
And by the way did she mention my name
[ harmonica ]
Is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang on the wall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high did the look in her eyes seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the lakes all turn to rain
And by the way did she mention my name

Did she mention my name...
And by the way did she mention my name

George Hamilton IV,"I know your leaving's too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show you
Goodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets no tears goodbye don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
It felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye

Just beyond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
Still feels so strange to leave my life alone

George Hamilton IV,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by you can stay the night beside her
And you know she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
Just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wave length and she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know she will trust you
'Cause you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time searching from his lonely wooden tower
And just when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him and you want to travel blind
And you think may be you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's weaving rags and feathers from salvation army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne

George Hamilton IV,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
George Hamilton IV,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be

Share a handshake and a tender tear or two
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye

George Hamilton IV,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway No 9 big 7-0-7 set to go
But I'm standin' on the grass where the cold winds blow
Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she's a rolling now at last
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shine
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a big jet plane like you can an old freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain




",Early Morning Rain
George Hamilton IV,"Well I got my mail late last night a letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewher's in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too to take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well I been up tight most every night walkin' around the streets of this old town
Not a friend around to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love
Well I look over yonder across that plain
The big drive wheels a poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal and Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well here I am with my hat in my hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love

Oh, Lucille, won't you do your sister's will?

George Hamilton IV,"There's a family Bible on the table 
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table 
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over 
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin' round the table 
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world of ours is full of trouble 
This old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables 
And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
I can see us sittin' round the table 
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages 
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me",Family Bible
George Hamilton IV,"[ Jan ]
Once I stood in the night with my head bowed down
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day from here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone
[ steel ]
I may live like a queen in a palace so tall with great riches to call my own
But now there's not a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way...

Could equal or surpass the art of dying

There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading
When things that seemed so very plain
Become an awful pain
Searching for the truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned the art of dying

But you're still with me
But if you want it
Then you must find it
But when you have it
There'll be no need for it

Or go astray

While I'm living in the material world
Not much 'giving' in the material world
Got a lot of work to do
Try to get a message through
And get back out of this material world

I hope to get out of this place

George Harrison,"The Lord loves the one that loves
The Lord
And the law says if you don't give,
Then you don't get loving

Now the Lord helps those that help
Themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you

We all making out
Like we own this whole world
While the leaders of nations
They're acting like big girls
With no thoughts for their God
Who provides us with all
But when death comes to claim them
Who will stand,
And who will fall?

The Lord loves the one that loves
The Lord
And the law says if you don't give,
Then you don't get loving

Now the Lord helps those that help
Themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you

We all move around,
With objectives in mind,
To become rich or famous,
With our reputations signed,
But the few that can reach,
To this coveted slot,
Don't escape old age creeping,
Through their bodies,
Like a rot

While the Lord loves the one that loves
The Lord
And the law says if you don't give,
Then you don't get loving
Now the Lord helps those that help
Themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you",The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)
George Harrison,"I've been held up,
I've been run down
I can see quite clearly now
Through those past years,
When I played towing the line.
I only ask, that what I feel,
Should not be denied me now,
As it's been earned, and
I have seen my life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

I've lived in fear,
I've been out there,
I've been 'round and
Seen my share
Of this sad world
And all the hate,
That it's stirred
I only ask,
That what I know,
Should not be denied me now
As it's been learned,
And I have seen my life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

I only ask, that what I feel,
Should not be denied me now
As it's been earned, and
I have seen my life belongs to me

My love belongs to who",Who Can See It
George Harrison,"I've heard how some people, have said
That I've changed
That I'm not what I was
How it really is a shame
The thoughts in their heads,
Manifest on their brow
Like bad scars from ill feelings
They themselves arouse
So hateful of anyone that is happy
Or 'free'
They live all their lives,
Without looking to see
The light that has lighted the world

It's funny how people, just won't
Accept change
As if nature itself - they'd prefer
Re-arranged
So hard to move on
When you're down in a hole
Where there's so little chance,
To experience soul

I'm grateful to anyone,
That is happy or 'free'
For giving me hope
While I'm looking to see

The light that has lighted the world

To eclipse out the sun
That has lighted my love for sometime
And a cold wind now blows

Not much tenderness flows
From the heart of someone feeling so tired
And he feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad

While his memory raced
With much speed and great haste
Through the problems of being there
In his heart at arm's length

Held within its great strength
To ward off such a great despair
But he feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad

Take the dawn of the day
And give it away
To someone who can fill the part
Of the dream we once held

Now it's got to be shelved
It's too late to make a new start
And he feels so alone
With no love of his own

Who stand around and crucify you while you do your best
It's easier to see the books upon the shelf
Than to see yourself

It's easier to hurt someone and make them cry
Than it is to dry their eyes
I got tired of fooling around with other people's lies
Rather I'd find someone that's true

George Harrison,"Chose a life in circuses
Jumped into the deepest end
Pushing himself to all extremes
Made it, people became his friend

Now they stood and noticed him
Wanted to be a part of it
Pulled out some poor machinery
So he worked 'til the pieces fit

The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams

Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it
But it's true, they say
""He's the master of going faster""

Now he moved into the space
That the special people share
Right on the edge of do or die
Where there is nothing left to spare

Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail

The people were intrigued

So few have even tried
To realize their dreams

If you believe in me,

No sooner had I ooped it down
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on

My legs seemed to me like high-rise buildings
My head was high up in the sky
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon

And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far
And hadn't they just seen me up on Haleakala
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadn't heard
There was someone there beside me, swimming like Richard III
And I'm still smiling

Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools
Lone-ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules
Better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row
If it wasn't for my sunstroke I would take you on right now
And I'm still smiling

I fell in love with my soft-hearted Hana
She entered right in through my heart
And now although we're miles apart
I still feel her

She lives beneath the crater in the meadow
She moves among the fruit and grain
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen

Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from

Everything is cold and hopeless that he looks
     upon
He needs a friend a lover who can comfort him
His deeds offend he knows that he has brought

George Harrison,"You dance at the discotheque
That's why you look such a wreck
Your face is pale you look drawn
Your clothes are dirty and torn
You've got that look in your eyes that says
You're half alive and you're lost inside
Meanwhile you're back in your cage
Ego'd out on the stage
Where the unconsciousness rules

You've got yourself in a bind
You don't know how to unwind
Your senses unsatisfied
Take you along on a ride
You've got a way and a stance that says
You'll dance the pants off of everyone
Then you go back on the floor
You got to get through the door
Where the unconsciousness rules

You've lost a screw in your head
It shows the way you're led
Blind leading the blind
Nothing can stand in your way
You're living day after day
Where the unconsciousness rules",Unconsciousness Rules

It looks you in the eye mister
It's time we stand up tall
Go see and understand the writing's on the wall.

Strange we hold on to things that have no grace
Or power
While death holds on to us much more with every
Passing hour
And all the time you thought it would last
Your life, your friends would always be
'Til they're drunk away or shot away or die away
From you.

There's nothing that you need sister
The Lord is in you all
Life is designed to see the writing's on the wall.

The music's in the air mothers
You may have heard it call
To you that you may see the writing's on the wall.

Be watchful down that road
You've got a lot of love sister

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

All those years ago
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears

As I go round and round in circles

Love someone change your mind
Decide he was a swine
As you go round and round in circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles

Dislike someone and will not bend
Later they may become your best friend
As life it goes around in circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles

Soul takes on a body with each birth we make our date
With life and death along the road the soul reincarnates
The show goes round and round in circles

Becomes the same, then we stop going in circles
Round and round in circles",Circles

From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

Got me escaping from the zoo
Oh, baby I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
It won't be the same now I'm telling you

If I'll grow up I'll be a singer
Wear rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
Live and love and maybe someday
Who knows baby you may comfort me, yeah

I may appear to be imperfect
But my love is something you can't reject
Changing faster than the weather
You and me should get together
Who knows baby you may comfort me

I want the love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For your sweet tough lip I'm in the queue
Oh, baby I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
It won't be the same now I'm telling you

So glad you came here
It won't be the same now I'm telling you
So glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you, oh yeah, yeah

George Harrison,"Have you see the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt
To play around in

Have you see the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts
To play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a darn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives
To eat their bacon

One more time

In a car on a bike with a bus and a train

Spin of a wheel with the roll of a dice 
Ah yeah you pay your fare 
And if you don't know where you're going 
Any road will take you there 

And I've been traveling through the dirt and the grime 
From the past to the future through the space and the time 
Traveling deep beneath the waves 
In wattery grottoes and mountainous caves

With the thoughts in the head with the dark and the light 
No use to stop and stare 
And if you don't know where you're going 
Any road will take you there 

You may not know where you came from 
May not know who you are 
May not even wondered how

By the skin of my teeth by the breadth of a hair 
Traveling where the four winds blow

Filled my heart with delight
Last Saturday night

Arrived believing from home
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome
Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic
Last Saturday night

Now how come nobody really noticed
Puff of white smoke knocked me out
The truth is hiding, lurking, banking
Things they do at night

It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday Night

I wish somebody would tell me
That it's only a show
I'll confess, own up, let's face it

While the farmer stands around, and he's complaining
His mad cows are being put to sleep and I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

Like someone in there found the latest Pope
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury
While the churchbell ringer's tangled in his rope

That one unbounded ocean of bliss 
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters
But still an easy thing for us to miss

Blades go skimming through the water
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about
With this crew oh it could be a tall order
Have we time to sort all of these things out

A brighter light on high.

And have a brighter by and by.

With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

George Howard,"When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark",Piano in the Dark
George Howard,"I only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold
You just might get-a left now out in the cold

Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold
Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold

And when violets turn red

Things you can't brace yourself for

And can't be opened the doubts of dreams
Ever coming true can discourage you

Is ""Goodbye"" your only word?

Give me one good reason
Why I should stay here
One more season with him?
This guy is full of holes
And when he rains, he pours""

Now you, you say that you are here for me
But where we are is far from home
Have the children gone to sleep?

Now I can't afford to waste my time
Fearing that I've left my prime
Can't be wrong so I must be right

If they ask who's in the picture with me,
I say just a girl I used to know

Just a girl, I used to go around with
Just a friend, from long ago,
I don't tell them how lost I am without her
I say she's just a girl I used to know

I say she's just another girl now
Just a flame, that's lost it's glow
And I say, her name has slipped my mind now,
And she's just a girl I used to know

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33

George Jones,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them

But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say for me

It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind, I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there

Oh, that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug

Well, I always thought that I had me a pretty good style
But I lost that race by a good old country mile
Yeah, I was walking all around with my head held way up high
And then it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise

If your new romance turns out a failure here's where to find me my dear
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well

The floor's got a carpet of sorrow but no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror with only the ghost of a smile

Was the day that she told me she would be my own
But the bluest moment that ever could be
When she said she loved someone much better than me.

We trusted each other completely you see
Well, then I betrayed him just like any wretch
No one but a woman could make you do that.

For now they're all good and none are all bad
Then he made woman to cheat and deceive
There's been hell ever since the snake tempted Eve.

There's a love in my heart that I'd been keeping
I don't know how to give it away to someone new
Oh you walked out the door and left me weeping
And I can't change overnight from loving you
If I can't walk with you then I'll walk all alone
Where my feet touch the ground then that's where I'll call home
I don't like all this loneliness that I go through
But I can't change overnight from loving you
All you say to forget the lips I used to kiss
Find someone to take the place of a love I once knew
Yes you walked out the door and left me weeping
And I can't change overnight from loving you

George Jones,"Tonight I'm all alone and broken hearted
A love we knew I never shall forget
And tell myself that lonely night we parted
I got a lifetime to regret.

They tell me you are happy with another
And I wonder if my memory lingers yet
The things I said the night we said goodbye, dear
Oh, I got a lifetime to regret.

If we could just erase the mistakes we made, dear
I'm sure we could find happy moments yet
But we can't change the past and I'm afraid, dear

And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a guy I knew one time

Little children painting pictures of the birds and apple trees
Oh, why can't the grown up people have the faith of one of these
And to think those tiny fingers might become a killer's hand
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more than the selfishness in man.

Why can't we see the folly and the uselessness of hate
Love could lead to understanding maybe it's not too late
Then perhaps in his great wisdom we might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow and no selfishness in man.

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life's ended and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

I'll board the train I won't explain just why the reason is I'm lately
Cause you'll know why but not to cry just wait and see
I gave you a home you done me wrong I tried so very hard to please you
Well it's goodbye no use to cry it's gotta be

And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted while watching the bubbles in my beer

Speak once again of my love, my own.

It soubds so dogone heavenly, you can hear the Angels sing
And when you stomp your feet, your heart will beat,

George Jones,"WRITERS GEORGE JONES, HAL BYNUM


There's an old old house that once was a mansion
On a hill overlookin' the own
Where time's left a wreck where once was a beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down

When the leaves begin to fall in the autumn
And the raindrops drip from the trees
There's an old old man who walks in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory.

They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love withered in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after all.

(Battle of love)
For over a year I've been in love with a girl so sweet
But the guy next door has declared a war and I won't retreat
He hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
But I'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
We're just beginning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
He was once my friend through thick and thin but now I draw a line
For he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
But I know his plans so I'll take my stand and defend her
He's gonna find that I'm not the kind to surrender
I'm out for winning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
I can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
I know I'm right and ready to fight for my true love
He's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
So I've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
And when they say I do I'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
If he wins her love how I ever learn to live without her
Cause here she is in my arms so why should I doubt her
If I'm really winning this mighty battle of love
I'm really winning this mighty battle of love

That's standing in the pathway of our love
Yes we love each other dearly but we just can't find the way
Night and day there's friend in the way
I told him once I loved him too and he thinks I'd never lie
To me he's been like my right hand he thinks I'm quite a guy

She lives south of the North pole and I know the reason why
She's my Eskimo baby and I'll love her till I die

Crossing o'er the frozen river to a valley filled with snow
I lost all my directions and I knew not where to go
When a warm hand fell upon me and a voice said with a sigh
I would take you to my igloo Mister I won't let you die
Well she's my Eskimo baby...
And there came the day of parting and we had to say goodbye
As I crossed back o'er the river I could think I hear her cry

And mine from Brown to blue.

I couldn't keep my tears from falling,
On the courtroom floor,
By law, they took away my rights,
To love you anymore,
My world just seemed to stop,
While I stood there so close to you,
They changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

The judge forgot to tell me
How I'd live my life alone,
What I would do without you
After loving you so long,
He didn't seem to care that
I am still in love with you,
He changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

I couldn't keep my tears from falling,
On the courtroom floor,
By law, they took away my rights,
To love you anymore,
My world just seemed to stop,

And mine from Brown to blue...

Every hour of the day you're all I'm a thinkin' of
All week along when you're gone I sit around so blue
I just can't wait on Saturday that's my holiday with you
Monday Tuesday Wednesday wonder if you miss me too
Thursday Friday Saturday making plans just to be with you
Oh I'm a gonna be so sweet to you neath the moon above

George Jones,"Well I get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
I go crazy inside while you were gone
Yes I get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
I don't think I could take it very long

There would be so many little teardrops fall I don't think that I could count them all
And I know a heart could never ache like mine if I couldn't love you all the time
Cause I get lonely in a hurry...

If you ever took your love away from me I'd die
I don't think that I might live in memories
And for sure I know that I would lose my mind

I don't think I could take it very long




",I Get Lonely in a Hurry
George Jones,"I know you tried your best to love me
You smiled when your heart told you to weep
You tried to pretend that you were happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep

You gave the best years of your life, dear
And each precious vow you tried to keep
I love you so much I want you happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep

Your heart is yearning for an old love
With new love it's useless to complete
It hurts me to know you are unhappy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep

You know that you are free to go, dear
And don't mind if I start to weep
I know I can never make you happy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep

No more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again

I hear bells a ringin' I hear birds a singin' love's gonna live here again
I hear bees a hummin' and I know the day's a comin' love's gonna live here again

George Jones,"I'm making the rounds with someone new now that you've gone away
But making the rounds it's not the fun if it was with you
The glamor has gone from all the spots that seem so bright and gay
But making the rounds is all that's left for me to do.

I never go home till the last hide away place has closed its door
There's too much at home to remind me that we're through
I laugh and pretend that I'm not wishing for a bygone day
When we were in love and I was making the rounds with you.

For I feel those heartaches began
She's come back and I don't know what has brought her
She don't love me she's just lonesome again
For a while I know that I'll be happy
And that's all that matters within
Though I love her I know I can't hold her
But she'll come back when she's lonesome again
Just like always I'm waiting here for her
Yes it's true I always have been

And the undertow of loneliness gets strong
My heart's caught in the tide of a love that you've denied
For you're colder than this sea we're drifting on.

The sea between our hearts is dark and stormy
And the harbor of your love is the only haven for me
If I only had a chart to guide me to your heart
I'd anchor there and sail the sea no more.

There's a shore of happiness that somehow we have missed
And now you've drifted off to someone new
But I haunt the lonely sea with a crew of memories
For the compass of my heart still points to you.

But you better drop anchor my ship of love is sinking.

Every time I'm in beside you the tide of  life knot drags you on
And my little boat of love keeps you in sight for awhile but then you're gone
My love starts burning when I think you're turning around to see sick ole me
But you set sails on another trail and I'm a-drowing in a teardrop sea.

The very moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me

I should have got it back again in person
But so afraid my tears would start

You really should have broke my heart in person
If love is gone then I can't understand
But it hurts so much to hear it second hand

But I won't appear there anymore in person

Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a guy I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...

And the lonely know my secret they know you're on my mind
There's a secret behind the lies you tell
For inside is where the sorrow lies
Cause I'm living like the lonely do
For they've lost someone they love too
And the lonely know my secret they know what I go through
There's a secret behind the smile you see...
Yes the lonely know my secret they know I still love you

We'd say almost enough to buy a new home
A home filled with love and fun

And I know there's never been a fool
Like me, before tonight
That ain't right
Lord, no, everything ain't right

But I think I'll write my will out
And sign it before too long
You ain't a-gonna spend my money, uh-huh
Not after this poor boy's gone
That wouldn't be right
Lord, no, everything ain't right",Everything Ain't Right

George Jones,"FLAME IN MY HEART
(George Jones - Bernard Spurlock)
Â« Â© '59 Glad Music Â»
WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

You cheated on me (you cheated me)
I tried to be fair (I tried to be fair)
But you don't believe enduring your share
But I've learned my lesson (I've learned my lesson)
And now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me like they used to do
Your arms only chill me I'm glad that we're through
My heart was once yearning (my heart was once yearning)
But now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fool me a while (you fool me a while)
You thought you were wise (you thought you were wise)
You even believed I fell for your life
But the trick's turned on you (the trick's turned on you)
Now gladly I say (now gladly I say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me...



",Flame in My Heart
George Jones,"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay

[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

[Chorus]",Heartaches by the Number
George Jones,"I love you because you understand dear every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me

I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you cause you're you

I love you because my heart is lighter every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter the door to happiness you've opened wide

But most of all I love you because you're you",I Love You Because
George Jones,"Well there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't nobody big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
So love me if you ever gonna love me I never have seen a road too rough to ride
No there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze strong enough to slow me

So love me if you ever gonna love me...",I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)
George Jones,"I've got a sad, sad story friends, that I I don't like to tell
I had a home and family, when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years that's a long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me 'cause I've got life to go.

I went one night where the lights were bright to see what I could see
I met up with an old friend there, who's thought the world of me
He brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
But words were said and now he's dead, I just had to bring him down.

It has been a long time now since I've heard from my wife
I guess I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go.

I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
Yes, I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go.

Yes, I've still got life to go.
Yes, I've still got life to go",Life to Go
George Jones,"Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

And I'll stop and talk to you

I might say my name is Pete
And you say that yours is Joyce

Later I might say I'm Bill

You buy me an automobile
But I won't stay with you still
Unless there's money in this deal

Well, then she turned around and said
She'd rather be dead
Than to see me spend her money

George Jones,"Well, I was sent to a place in North Carolina
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my surprise
I could see a little light on the hill

Well, the fire was a glowing and really I was knowing
I was really hot on the track
But in D.C. they said it couldn't be
Well I'll be the one to bring 'em back

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can

Well the moon was shining bright and I looked down the river
I noticed on the side of the hill
I can see a red light that was glowing right bright
I knew it had to be a still

There were people down the road said it wasn't far
But I better know someone
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star
I'll bet my bottom dollar I'll have 'em on the run

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yes, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can

Well when I got back the woods was a bare
They must've knew I was on my way
Well, I heard the branches shatter and they started to scatter
I heard two or three of them say

It's the revenooer man
Yeah, It's the revenooer man
He got a big 45 with loads to fill
Dragging and a shagging to another hill
It's the revenooer man
And he'll get us if he can

Like the treasure of true love a love that won't die
So why should I worry what tomorrow will bring
For the treasure of love the treasure of love makes me a king

A shoulder to cry on is all you want from me
Someone to share your heartaches when you cry
Someone you can depend on, who will always be around
I'm nothing more than just your old standby

(Chorus:)
If you could call me darlin, if you could call me dear
If you could learn to love me by and by
I wouldn't mind this waiting, for I could stand the pain
I'd be more to you than just your old standby

You wouldn't call me darlin and you wouldn't call me dear
I wonder if you'll miss me when I die
You have no consideration, you show no sympathy
I'm nothing more than just your old standby

She'll come blowin' like a cyclone through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say

Well has anybody here seen sweet thing I got a notion he'll be headed this-a way
Cause when my sweet thing is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play

I want to tell all you barroom roses if my sweet thing does happen by
You'd better take my advice and if you blink more than twice
You'd better have something in your eyes

Well I gave my baby money on payday except a little she don't know that I've got
Cause there's a cute little waitress down at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
Well we were sittin' in this back booth a havin' a talk
And she's believed in every word that I said
When the door blew open and mama walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead

Well has anybody here seen sweet thing I got a notion he'll be headed this-a way
Cause when my sweet thing is out tomocattin' around

I drank a lot back then for one concern

I thought my social friend would help me make the turn

But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
For I kept the wine and threw away the rose

I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
As I slowly watched the bottle take command

With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S
Hoping that you would come back home
My darling if you knew
Just how much my heart was in distress

When it starts to sink then I'll blame you",I'll Sail My Ship Alone

I'm lookin' for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
If I could find that Lonely Street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street
Where's this place called Lonely Street",Lonely Street

An rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And it's true I'm not the man, Ruby, that I used to be
Ruby, I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age,
Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leavin' now 'cause I just heard
The slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam
One hundred times before

And Little Red Riding Hood was scared as a mouse

Run 'em off

Run 'em off

Now if you don't run 'em off
I'll swear your cheatin' on me

Now there's an iceman, a milkman, and folks out of town
They come to visit they just hang around
They act just as friendly as can be
But I don't think they care a thing about me

So run 'em off
Don't talk too long
Run 'em off
So we can be alone
Run 'em off
And make 'em let us be
Now if you don't run 'em off
I'll swear your cheatin' on me

Now once I ended this song but I can write some more
There's half a dozen wolves a-comin' up to my door
I can tell by lookin' it's plain to see
They're not here, darlin', makin' lies at me

So run 'em off
Don't want 'em around

And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone

And you leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you are free

When the postman delivered the letter
Well, it filled her old heart full of joy
But she din't know 'til she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
""Dear Mom,"" was the way that it started
""I miss you so much,"" it went on
""And, Mom, I didn't know that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won""
""I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
So don't scold if it isn't so neat
For you know as you did, when I was a kid
And would come home with mud on my feet""
""Well, the captain just gave us our orders
And mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you""
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
As she fought against tears in her eyes
For they came unashamed, there was no name
And she knew that her darlin' had died
That night as she knelt down by her bedside
She prayed, ""Lord above, hear my plea
Protect all the sons who are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free""",Soldier's Last Letter

I won't say that I'm the only one who loves her
And I won't say I make her happy all the time
There's someone she can't forget
I know she never will, and yet
But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine

She never once has told me that she needs me
And she forgets when I'm around her all the time
There are words I try to say
When she turns and walks away
But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine

She's mine and yet I know someday I'll lose her
But she'll never take this happiness I've found
And I know it may sound foolish when I tell you
That I'm satisfied just having her around

Even when she's in my arms I know she's lonely
I wish that I could take that someone from her mind
But since her mother left our world
She's been daddy's little girl
She's a baby, I'm her daddy, and she's mine

[Chorus]",When the Grass Grows over Me
George Jones,"[ with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris and Trisha Yearwood ]

The dirt was clay and was color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge in south Tennessee
We left our sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row
Tryin' to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow

There was one old store in the holler we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us credit in the winter time o we could live through the cold
When the winds brought snow
Tryin' to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
[ guitar ]
Oh the one I loved walked through those fields with me
She was a hard workin' woman true as one could be
Oh but then one year death was goin' round and swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow

As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the grains where Janie lies there's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows
Why there's flowers growing on ground so poor that grass won't grow
Now there's flowers growing on ground so poor that grass won't grow

You say there couldn't be rainbows in heaven
She's brought you happiness you've never known

But you may hate me for what I will tell you
But you'll thank me for setting you right
While you work to keep angels in heaven
Your angel steps out of heaven each night

Her heaven's not the same that you're living in
It's any place where there's music and some free drink thrown in
So call her your angel, I won't say you're not right

You want his love much more than mine

George Jones,"I was working in Miami for a day or two
I decided I'd look up a girl that I once knew
I bought some flowers and went to see a girl I used to know
The lady at her door said she had married long ago

Times will change and towns will change there I was alone
And suddenly I wondered would Susie be at home
So with some flowers in my hand I walked toward her gate
Someone touched me on the arm and said you'll have to wait

Then I noticed there were people standing in the line
Some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine
They explained that Susie had been in an awful crash
The doctors said that she had just a little while to last

When I walked into her room I felt the sense of shame
But I heard Susie whisper I'm awfully glad you came
She had been the girl that I had always gone to see
When someone that I cared for had been untrue to me

I handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand

I heard her whisper thank you for the second handed flower",Second Handed Flowers

WRITERS EDDIE NOACK, CINDY WALKER, AL RUMLEY

Papa brought flowers for mama today
And all the grown children, but it's not mother's day
I don't have no money, not even a dime
But I brought mama flowers like I have all the time.
Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils
I bring them to mama at the end of the day
And say flowers for mama, here's mama's bouquet.
They brighten her face and she holds me close
She'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
A smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hours.
Spoken:
Now mama was lying there, yes, they tell me she passed away
And she was surrounded by flowers that out-shined my bouquet
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile.
Sang:
Flowers for mama I picked them today
Not very much, just a simple bouquet
Mom wasn't so fancy but up there above
She's the prettiest flower in God's garden of love.

George Jones,"[Chorus]
Your heart turned left and I was on the right
You couldn't have hurt me more with dynamite
Thought I was your destiny, but just before you got to me
Your heart turned left and I was on the right.

I almost had the battle won, what could I have said and done
That put you in another's arms tonight?
I don't know where I lost out, I just know without a doubt,
Your heart turned left and I was on the right.

[Chorus]

Now my poor heart just moans and groans,
I walked around just kicking stones
Oh, cupid sure won't get another bite
Honey, why'd you lead me on
Without a warning you were gone.
Your heart turned left and I was on the right.

Yeah, your heart turned left and I was on the right.

Your heart turned left and I was on the right.

George Jones,"We've lived together for a long time
But now the love is gone we once knew
We're old enough to know we can't live life this way
And young enough to start with somebody new.

So it's divorce or destroying each other
Which one of the two should we chose
You say in your heart there's no love left for me
And in my heart there's no love left for you.

We stay together for the children
Soon the children will be grown and be gone
Yet we keep on destroying each other
And to live life this way just must be wrong,

So it's divorce or destroying each other
Which one of the two should we chose
You say in your heart there's no love left for me
And in my heart there's no love left for you.

In my heart, no love left for you",Divorce or Destroy
George Jones,"My life with trouble goes back to the candy
That I stole from Jessie Walker's country store
A penny separated me from choosing sides with honesty
And I just got tired of being poor.

Some folks eat their supper off of silver
And the only world they'll ever know is wealth
But I can't blame the rich folks for these big stone walls
This prison is the doings of myself.

Freedom ran away from me at twenty-three
I broke the lock on one to many doors
My hungry hands would not behave
When they got close to things they crave
I just got tired of bein' poor.

I remember Willie Jack who laughed at me
And the talking about the ragged clothes I wore
That's when Willie got a taste of all knuckles in his face
I just got tired of bein' poor.

George Jones,"Each day I live with faith from yesterday
When you were mine the sky's was never grey
With in our hearts each day was filled with spring
But that was long ago when love was green

The season now has grown from green to brown
The clouds of sorrow lets their rain fall down
You're no longer mine but I still dream
Of yesterday when love was green.

Each night I hold your picture in my arms
And kiss you lips pretending they're still warm
The bells of love and joy would loudly ring
If I could live one day when love was green.

But that was long ago when love was green",When Love Was Green
George Jones,"Like a string she's got me wrapped around her finger
And it gets a little tighter every day
It would break my heart to think that I would lose her
So I'll do anything I can to make her stay

If she could understand how much I need her
Then I know that she would never go away
For she's got me wrapped around her little finger
And it gets a little tighter every day

Let me tell you just how much I love my baby
Take the world and everything one may desire
For there's only room in my heart for this lady
Who keeps the burning in my heart as hot as fire

She writes to many checks but what the heck

The food she prepares I know is the best
That's ever been put on a plate
And hour by hour she's by the telephone
That's her favorite gossip place.

Well, I've had the lit end of a cigar pressed against my belly
Whupped upon with a crowbar till my eyeball turned to jelly
Accidentally nailed my index finger to the wall
Cut off half my toes and soaked my foot in alcohol
Well I've had my pelvis ruptured by an angry kangaroo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

Well, it's not because you measure fifty, twenty, forty-four
It's surely not because you own a chain of liquor stores
It's not because your daddy is the richest man in town
It's just that I've grown used to you and having you around

I've had my parents tell me son we don't love you at all
I've seen my sister's name written on a washroom wall
My best friend set my barn on fire and burned my horse to death
I went out with a girl who told me, ""George you've got bad breath""

She brightens any room, she walks inside
And the way she comes in smilin', you'd never think she ever cries

Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom in his world

Until one day they heard him ask a little green eyed girl.

What's your mama's name, child, what's your mama's name
Does she ever talk about a place called New Orleans
Has she ever mentioned a man named Buford Wilson
What's your mama's name, child, what's your mama's name?

Lost a month of life and labored to the county jail

Just another wayward soul the county had to claim
Inside the old man's ragged coat they found a faded letter

'Cause I just felt a ray of warm sunshine
She just walked in and kissed me and said how much she'd missed me
We're gonna have good weather one more time.

'Cause I can see the clouds of doubt no longer hang overhead
And the hurricanes of jealously have all come to an end
Well, the rain is gone and there's a rainbow in this heart of mine
No more stormy weather now there's sunshine one more time.

George Jones,"Well, I thought you'd found your happiness
Right here lovin' me
I thought my life was so complete
But how wrong can one man be.

You were the perfect deceiver
Yes, you knew just what to do
So who will I be loving now
Cause, I won't be lovin' you?

You told me that you loved me
And that you were satisfied
I couldn't see the truth 'cause I
Had love all in my eyes.

And now you've found another
And it tears my heart in two
So who will I be lovin' now
Since I won't be loving you?

So tell me where I'll go now
Tell me what I'll do
Who's lips will I be kissin'
Since I won't be kissin' you?

Well, I feel so lost and helpless
How can I start anew
So who will I be loving now
Since I won't be lovin' you?

I gotta get up and get some loving done
My life's so poor ain't been much fun
Well I got myself a woman and I know that you're the one
And I'll get up and get me some loving done
I've been sittin' in the corner of the world much too long
And you came by and gave me a happy song
Now my lonesome days are through and I'll give my heart to you
And I'll get up and get me some loving done
I gotta get up and get some loving done...
You're my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
And you're the prettiest woman I could ever know
When I look at you and see the whole world belongs to me
So I'll get up and get me some loving done
I gotta get up and get some loving done...
And I'll get up and get me some loving done

George Jones,"Honey, I'm home and it's late, the day is over
You've been running through my mind all day long
And there's somethin' I'm just dying to tell you
We're not lovin' enough here at home.

And maybe it's a woman's intuition
For I have those same feelin's too
We've been living, not loving together
And I'm so glad to hear it from you.

Turn out the lights, come to bed, let's get to together
Cause when your touchin' me you mean so much to me in my arms
You know I said I'll be right there, it'll be heaven
We'll be closer than ever again.

Closer than ever again",Closer Than Ever
George Jones,"My little girl came up to me in the kitchen this evenin'
While I was fixin' supper. And she handed me
A piece of paper she'd been writing on, and
After wiping my hands on my apron I read it
And this is what she said.

For mowing the yard, five dollars
For making my own bed this week, one dollar
Going to the store, fifty cents
Playing with my sister while you went to the store
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash one dollar
Getting a good report card, five dollards
And for raking the yard, two dollars
Total of fourteen dollas and seventy-five cents.

Well, I looked at her standing there expectantly
And a found memory flashed through my mind
And so I picked up the pen and turning the paper
Over this is what I wrote.

For the nine months I carried you
Growin' inside of me no charge
For the nights I sat up with you
Doctored and prayed for you no charge
For the toys that you chose
And for wiping you nose there's no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of my love
Is no charge.

Well, when she finished reading she had
Great big old tears in her eyes and she looked
Up at me and said mommy I sure do love you
Then she took the pen and in great big letters
She wrote, paid in full.

When you add it all up the cost of real love
Is no charge.",No Charge
George Jones,"I don't wanna see no lips of all the lips you've ever kissed

All that happened yesterday is now a part of history
Let me be your destiny let's do what's right for you and me
I don't wanna try and undo all the wrong somebody done you

George Jones,"Come all you merry makers
You wine drinkers and heart breakers
Pass me the bottle one more round
Come all of you love makers
All you cheaters and lie makers
Fill me with happiness and bring on the clowns.

There's a place around the corner and I can't wait to go
I can't stay away from there when I'm feeling low
Running from my problems, cheating on my wife
Acting like a hobo, running out on life.
Laughin loud, telling jokes, drinking to much wine
Gathered 'round the table we're all one of a kind.

Pass me the bottle one more round

I thought that I was happy till I saw you walkin' in
And through the loud and noisy crowd you reach out your hand
I know I shouldn't be here, I really don't belong
I'm proud that you still love me and you wanna take me home.

You wine drinkers and heart breakers

She's just playing one of her games
And tonight when I get home
Everything will be the same.

'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yes, I found her goodbye note
It just a game she's plays
It just a goodbye joke.

She's just goin' downtown shopping
She'll bring me back some sporty clothes
'Cause I'm always on her mind
No matter where she plans to go.

If I thought she was gone forever
Lord, I'd find me a hangin' rope
That's why I'm drifting now
It's just a goodbye joke.

You wrecked my life forever for you're a hit and run.

I should have known that you were speeding for you live your life so fast
I should have turned at night and let you pass
But my hungry eyes weren't watching as I met you held on
You left my heart in pieces for you're a hit and run.

It seems they just don't like me, the way I am
Tomorrow I may live the way they're thinkin'

But every word I spoke you always put me down
Tomorrow my arms may ache and want to hold you
Ah, but tonight I just don't give a damn

Now I just don't care what happens to you and me
I wanted to get you on my side but you always disagree

And she's just not the kind to do anything wrong
This room filled with goodness is gonna make the party die
Did you know she once made a Romeo cry.

She's not a dancer and she don't drink at all
No, I don't know her number if I were I wouldn't call
It's best you didn't know her and I'll tell you why
Did you know she once made a Romeo cry.

She's just another girl that once told me goodbye

Since we have been friends for so long
Well, she's really an outstanding woman
More precious than any I've known.

She's soft she's kind and she's gentle
She likes to be loved tenderly
She's the kind you won't ever get over
And she should belong to me.

Don't leave her at night she'll be frightened
She's afraid when the darkness sets in
And blue is her favorite color
And she prefers home loving men.

She likes roses on special occasion
Champagne makes her laugh and feel free
She wants to be held when she's lonely
And she should belong to me.

She should be here with me in these two arms of mine

And your body is the touch of most down by the water stream
And I love it when I take off my shoes
And take a walk to the wildest part of you

There's a bit of queen and blast around you
When I feel the forest socking in my morning dew
Yes that's when I feel the touch of wilderness in you

There's a country flavor in your honey tree
And while I'm here I think a lady drift all over me

When it came to lovin' oh you were something
I took all the love you gave and I surely made a mess
Yes, I lost in love but in sadness I've been successful

But if hurtin' is a talent then I know that I've been blessed

George Jones,"Well, I remember back in my younger days of high school
Back then baseball was my biggest dream
So when I stood in line for my turn at bat
I found that wasn't where they wanted me at
I wound up rotten the water for all the teams.

Well, there ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm leavin'
There ain't nobody ever loved me very long
No matter how much I miss our show
I get kicked around everywhere I go
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone.

So when my Uncle Sam called me to serve my country
I stood up brave and smiled and packed my duds
But to my surprise when I got there
They gave me the boots and cut my hair
I wound up scrubbin' the floor and a peelin' spuds.

No, ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm leavin'
There ain't nobody ever loved me very long
No matter how much I miss our show
I get kicked everywhere I go
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone.

Well, I met me a pretty little girl one day in Nashville
I loved her more than all of my wildest dreams
She took me for my money, my house and my boat
And didn't even leave me a goodbye note
I gave it all up, boy, did she strip me clean.

With the flowers bloomin' in the warm sunshine
Speaking love words, soft and sweet and as our lips slowly meet
We're together in the diary of my mind.

Yes, I can bring you back anytime I want to
Even though you've been gone a long, long time

But history shows that kindoms fall with time
Mistrust and deceit and the bottle it brought defeat

But someday I'll fill in the lines when she and I are free

She needs me to give her love and understanding
Some good old country love and nothing else
She needs me to throw my loving arms around her
And tonight I could use some love myself.

While the mornin' mist lays heavy on the ground
And the silence is like thunder
As the enemy prepares another round

And her soft satin armor
Lying on the far side of the bed
Wounded and heart broken
And scared by the killin' words I said

I have no rules in battle
So I fire the guns of anger once again
Oh, she's such a little thing
And there's no doubt about it I can win

But with teardrops as her weapon
She easily destroys my battle plan
And in shamefully retreatin', I smile at her
And then she takes command

Oh, what a sweet surrender
I'm captured by two lips so warm and tender
She completely surrounds me with her lovin' arms again
It was love that brought the battle to an end

Now the enemies are lovers once again",The Battle

Somehow they failed to mention the miles all along the way
Anyway that's how it happened, yeah, and it sure happened strong

Wrap me up in chains and drop me in
But I won't be gone long 'cause my love is just that strong
I'll come back and love you again.

Lock me inside a cage with the meanest kind of tiger
Throw the key away and let me be
Take me to a desert spot where the sun is oven hot
And leave me with no water there for me.

Take me to the north pole just as far as you can go
And dress me up in cloths that turn and bend
But there is nothin' you can do to keep me away from you
I'll come back and love you again.

Well, who did it and who done it
Has never done the things I would do
Before you count one, two, three turn around and you'll see
Me standing there smilin' right at you.

Put me in a rocket ship on my way to the moon
And let the final count down begin
Got me two railroad tracks but I'll find my way back
I'll come back and love you again.",I'll Come Back
George Jones,"Remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid

I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down

Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed

I had things more important to do
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world

That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me

If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground

And I'm the biggest baby that you've ever seen

Take this bottle from my hands and wean me.

Yes, you've wondered why I've always had a bottle in my hand
Why I never could give up my childish ways
Well, I'd rather be even with your help the man I'm going to be
Take this bottle from my hand and wean me.

And when I take that first big step I'll walk straight to you
Right into your loving arms that's where I want to be

Even a trace of gray would look good in your hair

You look good when you sit and rock our baby
You look great the perfect picture of a lady
And you look fine with your smile so angel soft and sunshine warm
But you always look your best here in my arms.

We look good walking together
And we feel so good holding each other
I'm depending on your tender love to keep me safe and warm

Just a few of my favorite lies . . .

Lately I don't even miss her
Yes it's true, out of sight and out of mind
All my love, yesterday, it has faded away
I'd be lonely if I could find the time
Helped her open the door when she left me
All I said was good luck and goodbye
Now at last I am free like I've wanted to be
These are a few of my favorite lies

I'm surprised I'm still talking about her
For I can stop any time, and I will
But if you feel like asking me questions
Well I have more lies I'm dying to tell
There's no room in my heart now for sadness
I've completely forgot how to cry
If she came back today I would turn her away
These are a few of my favorite lies
Just of my favorite lies

Popped a lot of cane in New Orleans

But everybody says he`s taken my place

You know where I'm going when I walk out the door
She wraps me 'round her finger as any fool can see
But I'm a fool for loving her and you're a fool for loving me.

She doesn't really want me, oh, but she keeps me hangin' on
I'm just someone to talk to when she's all alone
I know you keep on hoping someday she'll set me free
Well, I'm a fool for loving her, you're a fool for loving me.

She stole your pride, now you're nothin' but a fly
It drives me insane still I can't change the way I feel inside
How can you say I love you, I've taken all you have to give
How can you go on livin' the way you have to live

So we won't have to worry and we don't have to care
Looks like he's losing her, it's on it's way

George Jones,"As I look in the mirror this morning
On some dirty old restroom wall
It took a while to realize it's really me there inside
'Cause I've aged twenty years in five

I recall when I looked much younger
And it wasn't so long ago
But one night of drinking to four nights of wine
And you'll age twenty years in five

[Chorus]
I've aged twenty years in five
I've seen the dark side of life
From a mansion on a hill
To straight whiskey from a still
And you'll age twenty years in five

Before the bottle I played my music
On the road with a five piece band
And with the pressures of the game
I drank up fortune and fame
And I aged twenty year in five

Oh, but I'll change this way I've been living
Or I'll be gone before my time
I'll climb back to the top
And with my friends I won't stop

Till I erase twenty years in five
Yes, I'll erase twenty years in five",I've Aged Twenty Years in Five
George Jones,"Empty, I was just an empty shell 'til I met you
Hungry, just another hungry heart 'til I found you
Loving, loving was a feeling I never knew
Dying, I was dying for the life time with you

Your love is my breathe of life
Your love blows me away
I wasn't born yesterday
But I just started living today

Touching, there was lightning in the night when I touch you
And dancing, dancing in your loving arms, I wanted you
A love song swaying to the records that jukebox played
Living, I started living when you loved me each day

Your love is my breathe of life
Your love blows me away
I wasn't born yesterday
But I just started living today

George Jones,"If we don't make it, we've sure got a lot to forget.

(George)
It's just an empty two room flat but I still dream
Two rooms of hope and the world full of love, praying for better things
Our dreams came true but we are two, in silence here we sit
(Both)
If we don't make it we've sure got a lot to forget.

(Tammy)
Back when I made a coat by hand your hand always held mine
We only had one pair of shoes but that all we can wear at a time
If all our years just end with tears, not one will I regret
(Both)
If we don't make it we've sure got a lot to forget.

We may not make it but it makes me stop and think
I remember what when water was all we could afford to drink
And didn't have to hesitate to share our one last cigarette

George Jones,"Well, your office called to say you wouldn't be long. 
Since when did your boss get a jukebox of his own? 
When I called to see how long you'd be they said you'd been long gone 
You're headed right in the wrong direction if you wanna come home. 

Well, you're leaving clues that any ole fool can see. 
Honey, you're the fool if you think your foolin' me. 
If you wanna go just let me know, we can sure enough get it all. 
You're headed right in the wrong direction if you wanna come home.

If you want to keep your home you better straighten up your act. 
'Cause honey, I can love you, I can even help you pack.

George Jones,"Of all the people in this world, why you and I
With lovers here and everywhere we don't care enough to try
Why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?

And of all the hearts in all the world, why yours and mine
There's so many places love could die, we must leave the earth for a time
Oh, but it's in our hearts and it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?

Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life

You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
I stood and watched you walk away and I didn't even cry
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye

You gave me that old pep talk as you cried on my sleeve
You said that you'd come running day or night
You said that I could call on you throughout my lonely life

You kissed me in a way","Girl, You Sure Know How to Say Goodbye"
George Jones,"After all these nights together I still get lost in your perfume
And if I could write a love song every line would tell the truth
It would be a warm and soft one he'd watch my heart would say to you.

When you see me walk on water when the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over I won't need you anymore
Oh the feelings lay so easy lying here the way we are
And no one else could ever hold me like the heavens hold the stars.

George Jones,"I've heard the sound of my dear old momma crying
And the sound of the train that took me off to war
And the awful sound of a thousand bombs exploding
And I wondered if I could take it anymore

There were times when they almost drove me crazy
But I did my best, I took it like a man
But who would think in my lonely room I'd hear it
The one sound in the world my heart can't stand

To hear that sound and to know its really over
Through tear-stained eyes I watched her walk away
And of earthquakes, storms and guns and wars
Lord, nothing has ever hurt me more than that lonely sound
The closing of the door

And of earthquakes, storms and guns and wars
Lord nothing has ever hurt me more than that lonely sound
The closing of the door",The Door
George Jones,"Some come from Heaven, some crawl from Hell
And the good fight the bad for your soul
But it's hard to tell a lie from the truth
When you find one that easy to hold

There's no way of knowing which one you've been lovin'
Till you leave her or you lose her for good
And by then it's too late, you just mark it off to fate
Either way, you end up a fool

It's a fine line between Heaven and Hell
When the good makes you feel like you should
It's a fine line between Heaven and Hell
When the bad makes you feel just as good

A good one will love you for all that she's worth
A bad one will take you for more
A good one will cherish the key to your heart
And a bad one, a key to your door

A good one will love you for richer or poorer
But that makes the bad even worse
A good one will love you till death do you apart
And a bad one makes sure you go first

It's a fine line between Heaven and Hell
When the good makes you feel like you should
It's a fine line between Heaven and Hell
When the bad makes you feel just as good

It's a fine line between Heaven and Hell
When the good makes you feel like you should

George Jones,"Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper ""oh, I love you""
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say ""good morning, dear?""

There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Step right up, come on in",The Grand Tour
George Jones,"He said ""I'll love you till I die""
She told him ""you'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red
Every single ""I love you""

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Aww, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind

Isn't there any more
And the city square don't seem as big
As it did before

They tore down that old drug store
We used to love so much
But everything is still the same

That old school bus has long stopped runnin'
And I heard the driver died
And the movie house is all boarded up
Where we set side by side

And the sign that said ""State Champions""
It's covered up with dust
But everything it's still the same

He stood four stories tall
They shot him with missiles from aeroplanes

Just to keep his girl

I said it's bigger than both of us

He made that lizard crawl
It wasn't until he put his woman down
That she saw those big tears fall

Everybody laughs at Wino the Clown. 

They just know the reason why. 

But when she died, he died inside. 

He lost all his will to live and he had no use for pride. 
Not even all his children's love can bring him back again. 
He just crawled into a bottle, now he's waiting for the end.

They laugh when he comes down the street. 
Stumbles all alone. 
As they wave he smiles and holds his arm just as if someone's holding on.

Will read it in the paper and say, ""God rest his soul
No more will he wobble down life's highway

He just couldn't seem to make it anywhere on time""

She hung the moon but she hung it upside down

They say I put her up there
On a pedestal so tall
Well, I'll hang around down here on the ground
Just to catch her in case she falls

I think she hung the moon upside down
I think she's perfect at turning my world around
And if your heart, it needs breaking

George Jones,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand

And the clean a house and cooking for him is not her kind of bag

The change is plain to see
You took each part of this broken heart
And made a new man out of me

When I though that all was lost
Just look at what I found
You're living proof what love can do
The second time around

Mistakes I made in my younger days
At times the price seemed high
But the bridge I burned was a lesson I learned
And I'll get it right this time

I'll be the man you see in me
And I'll never let you down
You gave my heart a brand new start
The second time around

You're every dream I ever dreamed
And my first one to come true
I've never heard more sweeter words
Than when you said, “I do”

And when it's all said and done
If this whole world lets me down
God above will bless our love
The second time around

God above will bless our love
The second time around

George Jones,"CUP OF LONELINESS
(George Jones - Burl Stephens)
Â« Â© '59 Glad Music Â»


I see Christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
Called out of darkness a new life to begin
Were you ever in the valley when the way is dark and dim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with Him

Did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake
The stand that you so boldly for the Lord did take
Did they ever mock at you and laugh in ways quite grim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with Him

Did you ever try to preach then hold fast and pray
And even when you did it there did not seem a way
And you lost all courage then lost all your vim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him

Oh my friends 'tis bitter sweet while here on earthly sod
To follow in the footsteps that our dear Savior trod
To suffer with the Savior and when the way is dark and dim
To drink of the bitter cup of loneliness with Him




",Cup of Loneliness
George Jones,"Don't stop the music let it play one more song
The same one that's played tonight for so long
She's out with another I saw them tonight
Sitting there close together she knows that not right
So don't stop the music let it play one more song
The same one that's played tonight for so long
My pockets are empty I spent my last dime
But I've just got to hear that song one more time

Don't be mad at me Mister I know that it's wrong
But I want you to hear the words of that song
So don't stop the music don't make me go home
I know she's not there and I cry all night long
So don't stop the music...",Don't Stop the Music
George Jones,"Well, it won't be long now
Until that 'ol sun goes down
And darkness helps me hide my shameful tears.
My wife works all night long
For a man who's halfway gone
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.

It's a shame she wears the name
Of a man who's locked and chained
To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares.
To the men with the hungry eyes
She works and hides her pride
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstair

The door to my heart locked when you walk out on me
You sealed it with a time lock to be locked eternally
You thought it's locked forever and I could never love anew
But today must be forever cause the light is shining through
And now the time lock has opened up the door to my heart
The seal you thought was so secure has shattered all apart
My heart has struck the lock and kept this hurt lock before you
And now somebody else is broken the time lock falling through
When you sealed the time lock you locked my heart up tight
Inside the heart it's cold and dark without a sparkling light
Another's love was strong enough to break the seal in two
This new love I feel is true and real at last I'm free from you
And now the time lock has opened...



",Time Lock
George Jones,"Oh lend me a hand please Lord and guide me
And help lead me down the road that is right
Oh carry me through these hours of darkness
And show me the path the shining light
I'm a wandering soul I'm lost from my savior
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold

Just tarrying along in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday you'll save my soul
Dear Lord please forgive the grief I have caused you
The thoughts of my sins that tortured my soul
Oh help me to know the joy of salvation
Help cleanse my life through and make me whole

My lovin' I believe it without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby then you gotta be my baby
And you gotta leave 'em kissin' cousins out

I get suspicious and I'm a gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine

Now I heard there was another so I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around besides me
She gave me no satisfaction and now I can't take no action
But I think I'll hang around and see

And you gotta come to me and tell me so
If you're gonna be my baby then you gotta be my baby

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

I once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens
She out shined all others that I'd known by far
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor
Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car

[Chorus]

By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan
I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'
She lost her desire to become my young wife

I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan
Then I started wonderin' what good would it do
If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition
Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too

My papa was a great old man I could see him 
With a shovel in his hand see education 
He never had he did wonders when the times got bad

Cause every day I had to work the fields 
Cause that's the only way we got our meals you see

And all the kids have grown the angels took mama

George Jones,"Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul

Needing a friend to save me in the end where could I go but to the Lord

Yet when I face the chilling hand of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go...",Where Could I Go But to the Lord

George Jones,"I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My dad was a poor, hard-working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay.

I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And he said I wasn't good enough to claim his daughter's hand.

That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan.

I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said honey, I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history.

Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you're a wise, young, ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim.

So now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
And it serves him right and no one here is missing him

George Jones,"Once, I lived a life of wine and roses
I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought, my social friend would help me make the turn

But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
For I kept the wine and threw away the rose

I stood by and watched, the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
As I slowly watched the bottle take command

And now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose

To angry when you set your soul and dark clouds on you frown

Is you soul and body weary, the task of rowin' hard
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known

February brought us broken hearts

We know that your spirit is there

No, no, I can't forget the hours

And sweeter than the flowers
No, no, there's no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt father

It looks so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead

They all gathered 'round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
It hurt us so bad you know

But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going,
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind, 
I watched his hair turn thin and gray, but his dream never faded, 
He told me all about it at least a thousand times.

Where the birds sing, in the morning,and the grass is emerald green, 
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine, 
And sit out in the evenin', where the air is, fresh and clean. 

It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses, 
And more to get his son out of his run-ins with the law, 
The more it took the more he gave, never once complaining, 
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all. 

I never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city,

I stammer and I walk right into doors
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
Oh, you know her honey, she's a friend of yours

You comb her hair every mornin'
And make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed every night",You Comb Her Hair
George Jones,"We try hard to hold on too
You lost your patience and I lost my mind
Now you asked me would I go through it
If you came back one more time.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try.

Just as sure as California
Has a white Atlantic shore
And a long eastern sunset
I won't want you for anymore.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try.

There will be icebergs in the arctic ocean
There will be seashells in the Florida pan
And an old heart with in me beatin'
Before I ever take you back again.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try",A Cold Day in December
George Jones,"She said hello
And I said hon', it's me
She said I might have known
And I said oh, listen please
Leaving you for her was wrong
Please let me come back home
This old town's closed down
And I have no place to go

[Chorus]
And she said
Hell stays open all night long
Hell never closes
It's open from dawn 'til dawn
When I slammed the door to heaven
I should have known
Hell stays open all night long

She said good-bye
Don't call me anymore
For the one that I love now
Is at my door
Some one has took your place
This is something you'll just have to face
As far as I'm concerned
When you have no place to go, remember

[Chorus]",Hell Stays Open (All Night Long)
George Jones,"By now I guess she's wondering how I'm doing
If it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.

I bet she don't think I'm going miss her
Probably think she's always on my mind
But every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.

She believes that I can't live with out her
And it hurts so bad sometimes I almost die
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.

You know I'll bet way down deep
That she thinks that I'll always love her
And I'll bet she thinks I'll never love another
No matter how hard I try.

'Cause every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.

Lord, every night I sleep just like a little bitty baby
I wake up every hour and cry...",I Sleep Just Like a Baby
George Jones,"I saw a sweet old couple in the park the other day
Holding hands and smilin' in an old familiar way
Then I thought about you and how I'd feel without you
And I knew, honey, I knew.

I want to grow old with you
Huggin' and holding you
Be my little old lady
And I'll be your big old baby
Honey, I do, I want to grow old with you.

We'll move to California or the sunshine state
If they're not to crowded in two thousand twenty-eight
Pacific or Atlantic we'll still be romantic
You and me, just a-wait and see.

I want to grow old with you
Kissin' and holding you
Be my little old lady
And I'll be your big old baby
Honey I do, I want to grow old with you.

When we meet the neighbors then we'll understand
I might start all over and be with you again
You and me together forever and ever
I hope I can but until then.

I want to grow old with you
Squeezin' and holding you
Be my little old lady
And I'll be your big old baby
Honey it's true, I want to grow old with you.

Yea, I want to grow old with you
Squeezin' and holding you
Be my little old lady
And I'll be your big old baby
Honey, I do, I want to grow old with you.

Oh, I want to grow old with you
Squeezin' and holding you",I Want to Grow Old With You
George Jones,"Since you've been gone I don't sleep no more
I just stay at home and walk the floor
To keep my heart from breakin' there's just one thing to do
If the world don't end tomorrow I'm comin' after you.

The sun may shine and the wind may blow
I'll travel through rain, I'll travel through snow
Lord, I'm tired of tryin' and wonderin' what to do
If the world don't end tomorrow I'm comin' after you.

Some people can live with a broken heart but not me (not me)
And I'm not gonna let you tear it apart you see
I'll move a mountain that's how I feel
I'll swim the ocean in a suit of steel
And the quick sands full of crocadiles
Just watch me wade on through
If the world don't end tomorrow I'm comin' after you.

George Jones,"Caught my wife with another man
Now I'm doin' ninety-nine
At a prison down in Georgia
Close to the Florida line.

I've been here for twelve long years
And I finally made the warder my friend
So he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' Red.

Now ol' red he's a dangerous dog
This old boy has ever seen
He's got a nose that can smell a two day trail
Lord, he's a four legged tracking machine.

Just consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red.

Hear the warder say,
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' sun.

I payed off a guard and he slipped out a letter
To my cousin in Tennessee
And he brought down me a blue tick hound
Lord, she was pretty as she could be.

They penned her up in the swampland
About a mile just south of the gate
And when I take ol' Red for his evening run
And I'd just drop him off and wait.

Hear the warder say,
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' sun.

Now old red got use to seein'
This little lady.there every night
So I kept him away for three or fours days
And waited till the time got right.

I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em let him out
'Cause I headed north to Tennessee
And ol' Red was a-headed south.

I hear the warder say,
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' sun.

Now, there's red hair blue ticks dogs in the south
Love got me in there and love got me out",Ol' Red
George Jones,"If my old truck was a horse I'd have to shoot it
Lord, the day my ship came in I was waiting for a train
Every time I get a grip I always lose it
I can't enjoy the sunshine for the rain.

Hon., you know I'm always saying I'm sorry
But you stand by me through it all
Seems like every time I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall.

Every time I think I'm off and running
I'm barely up to a crawl
Every time I get a leg up on the ladder of success
I shake and fall.

Back last week down at the factory
I was up for a promotion
And the bosses little brother got the call
Seems like every time I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall.

If my old truck was a horse I'd have to shoot it
Lord, the day my ship came in I was waiting for a train
Every time I get some news there's nothing to it
You're my only pleasure from the pain.

Hon., you know I'm always saying I'm sorry
But you stand by me through it all
Seems like every time I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall.

Seems like every time I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall",Somebody Always Paints the Wall
