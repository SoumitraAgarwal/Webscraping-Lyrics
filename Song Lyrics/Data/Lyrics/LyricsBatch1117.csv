Rick James,"Girl, you're cute, you're sweet
You're such a sexy treat
You are the girl that turns me on
And when you're hot, you're hot
I love the stuff you've got
You are the kinky girl I write about in every song

(Do do dah do do da do do dah)
(Do do bop bop, baby)
(Do do dah do)
Don't be so hard to get

(Do do dah do do da do do dah)
(Do do bop bop, baby)
(Do do dah do)
'Cause I will get you yet, ho

Don't be so hard to get, baby, baby
Don't be so hard to get, baby, baby

Girl, you're loose, you're tight
You're black and even white
You have a rainbow sex appeal
And when we dance, romance
You give me such a chance
To get the kind of love
That no man ever has to steal

(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Don't be so hard to get
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
'Cause I will get you yet

You keep on runnin', baby
Why you runnin', baby?
Stop your runnin', yeah

Listen to this, girl

Girl, you're cute, you're sweet
You're such a sexy treat
You are the girl that turns me on
And when you're hot, you're hot
I love the stuff you've got

Don't be so hard to get (I will get you in the end)

Don't be so hard to get (I'll give you love you can remember)
Keep your lovin' kinky (I'll give you love you won't forget)

When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound, well

When you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top

Standing on the top, top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah), top
On the top getting down, Temptations sing

Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When you're on the top
Everyone you meet they want to be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks)

When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go, [I don't know] I don't know
People sit and stare
Askin' crazy questions, ""Do you braid your hair"" and ""What's L-7 Square""

Standing on the top, top
On the top getting down, ho

Hey...hoo
Standing on the top, top
On the top getting down, down, down, down

Can you understand it [We understand it]
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
When I say that funk is here to stay [We understand it]

That funk is here to stay, oh [We understand it]
If you understand it say, ""Yeah"" {Yeah...yeah...}-a",Standing on the Top
Rick James,"A little girl came up to me, acting young and shy
A look of curiosity was flashing in her eyes
She had seen my face before and thought she knew me well
So I said ""Shall we talk some more, you'll come to my hotel""

She was only seventeen, seventeen
But she was sexy
She was only seventeen, seventeen
She said she loved me
Seventeen years old
Seventeen years old

How we talked all through the night and never even touched
Even talked of love and life, I wanted her that much
She said she'd read a magazine that said I was a freak
""You'll never know now, little girl, unless you take a peak""

She was only seventeen, seventeen
And she was sexy
She was only seventeen, seventeen
But she was you and fine and oh so tender
Would I break down tonight and surrender
This young girl, this sweet thing, I just can't wait
No, I mustn't do this, she's almost jailbait!

Baby, what's happening
Entre vous Lady Tee
I've heard a boatload of others ladies' raps
But they ain't got nothin' on me

I like sophisticated funk
I live on Dom Perignon, caviar, filet mignon
And you can best believe that's bunk
Here's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz

I've been called Casper, Shorty, Lil' Bit
And some they call me Vanilla Child
But you know that don't mean my world to me
?Cause baby, names can't cramp my style
I love chick-icken
And Buff's collard greens
A little hot water corn bread
I love you too Cat daddy
But don't you let that go to your head
That's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz

You know I love spirituals and rock
Sarah Vaughn, Johann Sebastian Bach
Shakespeare, Maya Angelou
And Nikki Giovanni just to name a few
Well, I'm wild and peaceful Lady Tee
I got to keep my irons in the fire, you see
I got the point, the scam, the low, the deal
What you feel, say what

Flash back, who's that
Flash back
Flash back, who's that
Flash back

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

Rick James,"When I was a young boy
Growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners
Singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the cute chicks
Trying to find a bit of fun
Looking for some trouble
Or anyone who'll give me some

I was young and crazy
In the ghetto
Didn't know what my life would be
In the ghetto
I was dumb and oh so lazy
In the ghetto
Something had a spell on me
In the ghetto

You want to know what I'm talkin' bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Life
You want to know what I'm singin' 'bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Life

When I was a young man
Kind of free and fancy
Met this little cute girl
She said her name was Nancy
She had pigtails to her shoulders
She couldn't have been much older
She taught me what I had to know
To make a girl not want to go

She was very kinky
In the ghetto
She laid her pigtails down on me
In the ghetto
And I was feeling oh so sneaky
In the ghetto
I had to see what love could be
In the ghetto

I knew it all along
That my game was strong
But I was wrong that time
I knew I had to pray
And give myself away
Did you think I was man enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was smart enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was strong enough?
Yeah
Did you think I'd work it out?

The Ghetto Life
Sing it to ya, hit it baby baby
Talkin 'bout ghetto life
You got to get on over
Talkin 'bout ghetto life

When I was a young boy
Tenements, slums and corner bums
Playing tag with winos
The only way to have some fun
One thing 'bout the ghetto

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Rick Jarrett,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind

The autumn leaves of red and gold

But I miss you most of all my darling

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Out past some no trespassing signs
Burning time with friends I used to know

All the years have washed away the voices, faces and the names
But anytime I think about those days

I remember the music, that was playing
The way we were singing right along
Still know every word by heart
And I remember the feeling
In the magic of the moment
The rhythm of that song
Dancing underneath the stars
And I might forget some things we said
And what we did
When I think about the way it was back then

Don't know if it was you or me
Different roads or different dreams
All I know is someone said goodbye
Maybe we weren't ready yet
To let go of our innocence
Guess we'll never know the reason why

But broken hearts, tears and mistakes
All vanish like a summer rain
And when I close my eyes I see your face

Still know every word by heart

Did she leave satisfied?

And the fisherman, he puts a claim on you
But it's nothing but a bluff

So with jealous hands tied 'round my back
I stumble 'cross the floor
Not knowing how to speak
I keep reaching for the door

""I know, you know me, well"" I say
""'Cause I'm the palace guard
Remember me, we made love today
At the King's bazaar""

With eyes that never see
I can feel something start
To die inside of me

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen
Now I realize
To you it's all a dream

So before you show me everything
There's something I must know
I've worked with your friend John, the geek
And his sidewalk trav'lin' show

I know your childhood tailored dreams
Are very well disguised
So you don't have to fake it anymore
It's all been memorized

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen

As the nearness dawns, the moth is gone
Leaving trailless tracks

A chance to share old memories and play our songs again

Proud to steal her anything she sees

Where they say I pillaged and I killed and I stole

On the road most of my life
Got me some stories, moments of glory
But it cost me the love of my life

making spirits bright,

Misfortune seemed his lot;

In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

How could he do it, why should he do it
He never done it before

How can you ask me am I blue

How the bee was made and the bee made the honey
And the honeybee looking for home they called honeycomb
And they combed the world and they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And a honeycomb from a million trips made my baby's lips

Oh honeycomb won't you be my baby well honeycomb be my own
Just a hank of hair and a piece of bone and made a walking talking honeycomb
Well honeycomb won't you be my baby honeycomb be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife like a honeycomb
Now have you heard tell how he made a bee
Then he tried a hand at a green green tree

So the green was made I guess you heard up in well he made a little bird
Then they waited all around 'til the end of spring
Gettin' every note that the birdie sing
And he wrote it up in one sweet tone for my honeycomb
Oh honeycomb won't you be my baby...
In a little while when he made that girl they looked around for a little word


Sounds as sweet as turtle dove so they called it love
And when he went around looking everywhere
Gettin' love from here, love from there
And he started up in a little ol' part for my honey's heart
Oh honeycomb won't you be my baby...",Honeycomb

Rick Roberts,"You were mine for just a while
Now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back
At your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same

When you've learned these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown

Rick Roberts,"They followed him for seven days
And lost him when he turned away
From where they thought
He would surely go
But they caught him up in Lewistown
And when they shot that convict down
They could hear him
Praying soft and slow

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me
Deliver me
I'm lost and alone
And I wanna come home

She was just a simple girl
Been a step behind a changing world
Ever since the day she was born
So she found herself a city gent
He loved her for a while and then
She cried as he walked out the door

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me
Deliver me 
I'm lost and alone
And I wanna come home

You been using and you been using
All your precious time
No use crying
You've been trying to stay ahead
Of what you left behind
You oughta stop trying
I've been here for oh so long
Only barely holding on
To everything I always thought was true

But all my diamonds turned to dust
There's nowhere I can place my trust
Someone has the answer
But I don't know who

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me

And I wanna come home",Deliver Me

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Rick Roe,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

Met me on the south side of the city with a whole thing
Iced 'em with the heater, took his shit, it's a cold game

Rick Ross,"Learn to walk a tightrope
Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?
They putting liens on a nigga things
Publicize your demise, and by all means
Your family fortune is forever what you stood on
Sold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on
You reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions
To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons
These niggas always smiled when I came around
They let you know my reputation when you in my town
A real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract
Bottom line blood, show me where them one’s at
That paper it get funny when publishing is involved
Mechanicals never mattered because that was your dog
Now you hands-on, but things don’t ever seem right
You make a call to give your lawyer the green-light
He look into it then hit you up with the bad news
It’s so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes
Mafioso, baby girl, cash rules
Every dollar accounted for, double M the crew

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel

Planting poison in a nigga mind
Chilling with your boys when it’s time to grind
We both come from those humble beginnings
Still can’t believe we never followed each other on Twitter
Funny thing is the animosity money brings
Real niggas out of style we may be one in three
Back against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys
One bullet, one target, one choice
You can take an L or take the shell
It's still double M still making mills
Made niggas respect my hustle on both coasts
I put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest
I need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest
You still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches
And I never took an L back when Meek fell
Just drove the numbers all the way back up at retail

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel

Can’t be writing checks with your eyes closed
While you living out of homes in different time zones
Mind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones
Pistol to your ear, this that level I’m on
I apologize woadie but this all I got
Everybody in this office we could die tonight
I never met an artist who fully recouped
These the deals the deal dealers wanna deal to you
Young niggas, time to act your age
Buying belts you seen on other niggas waists
Hoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online
Whole time, shorty knowing I’m the gold mine
Put it on all he needed was a co sign
Black minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine
TV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine
You’ll foreclose or fold just for soul signs

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks

Bricks, big face hundreds in bundles
Boy, I'm a boss, I rose from the jungles

In a room full of heathens, good niggas die alone
Better start taking notes as I'm taking tokes

Cause I wake up to a bowl of Lobster bisque?
And I wake up on some mobbin' shit
With a great view and half my niggas swappin' bricks
It's just a way of life
For the king of diamonds, so I gotta stay tonight
Fifty cash in the Louis for the chicken wings
Started in a neighborhood and now we on to bigger things
Large clique of my constituents
Combination to the safe, straight to the Benjamins
Living life to the fullest was the emphasis
Making love to Mary J's ""Reminisce""

It was all good just a week ago

My bitch sittin' cute, she left her panties home
Suckin' the dick of the don, I'm talking Miami's own
Money like (LeBron James), money like (Dwyane Wade)
(Play it right) peelin' two off the dealership in the same day
(Say it right) paid like Mark Clayton, Mark Duper
Soon as niggas start hatin', start shootin'
Come along, money longer than Olajuwan's
Lotta one's, all the bitches gotta model one's
Tongue pierced, dick sucked, said ""I swallowed once""
Fifty million, I'm the only one that got it done

He claim that he a soldier, fold up a flag for his momma
I've got gold in my blood, born a son of a king
I'm as real as they come, oh it's a wonderful dream
On the phone Farrakhan gave me my first Quran
We joined hands, said a prayer, may Allah bless the don
Ain't nowhere to run, already sold out the seats
We been them niggas, better go ask them freaks
Lipstick on my cheeks, extortion all through my vows (my vows)
They say it's suspicious all this money I found
Go give me the crown, you niggas been in denial
We the hottest niggas out, my nigga Kanye'll vouch
The devil in a dress, Rozay in the chest
Push it to the limit it's a OG in the flesh

I don't even think they see me, hoes disappear, Houdini
I get what I wanna, you would think I own a genie
If I ain't on my corner, probably on your TV
Pimping these hoes like Joseline, ""why you do that Stevie?""
Play no games with these bitches, they treat me like I'm Tony
I put cheese on you rats, get hit with that macaroni
Bout them collard greens all these rappers be acting phony
You sold your soul for some food and went broke, now you salty
You want your cornbread?
Give me that, give me that, niggas that's old bread
Spending that, flipping that, get it back with my old heads

Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can't hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angel bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a perk, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
.357 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it

I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get the cock
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass in stocks

But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just running my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessing my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hit this thinking to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Send the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the gram, they trending Meech home
In the D, my G, he throwing that peace on
Every picture that you post leave comments on each one

I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change but I'm always out, fucking around in the club
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit but I'm

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

Life's short and baby girl you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver
Saying sorry, laying up, way up in your liver
Boss, the red bottom's got you walking funny
Get you an agent, she balling and all she talk is money
Take her shopping, baby boy ain't no salary caps
She get it popping so you better bring battery packs
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than being a perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budget
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

Tell lucien, and I say  fuck it

Bag it like we in Publix
And take her ass out in public
Order her a filet told her butterflies, she'll love it
She's used to soda and nuggets, she's really just out here thuggin'
I'm just here in my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that young rich motherfucker

Getting blessed on the ?, it's a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind

All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts

When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)
Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)

Walk in the 40-40 I'ma score, bet it
Four tennis chains hoe, I'm progetic

I got a dirty mouth but my kicks is clean
Them folks ridin' hid the pots and the triple beams
Hit the Dodge spot I must've copped six Magnums

Now here are some interesting facts about the mastermind
Which give you an idea of how important it is
And how necessary that you embrace this principal 
And make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation

First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow 
And use the education, the experience, the influence 
And perhaps the capital of other people in carrying out your own plans in life
It is the principle through which you can accomplish in one year more 
Than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime 
If you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success

There is no such thing as something for nothing
Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid

I just upped my stock, fuck them cops

Rick Ross,"It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, Triple C!

When you serve a cat a couple of times
Knowin' he serve in a couple of towns
Polaco, Pensacola, down to Duval
It put you in the midn of a pimp like Too $hort
Classy nigga walkin' 'round with stacks
But I'm gettin' word that he talkin' behind my back
Now is the time to listen, you gotta pay attention
He may pay a henchman, put him up on where you livin
Tell him all your cars, makes and models
Tell him how you on steaks and bottles
Opium Sunday, Oxygen Tuesday
How you go to the boxing gym tryin' to lose weight
He done told a nigga all your routes
And now you got a lowlife tryin' to figure you out
Catch you in the driveway, trigger you out
That's what killers about, that's what niggaz allow remember

Nigga please! You ain't a cap peeler
Save that  for your bathroom mirror
No platoon dealer; you niggaz baboons
Half gorilla, a camp of scrillers
Triple C stamp the trillest
I got B's I'ma spend it, I don't care what the bill is
Them hoes stay at the billets
And when they ask what year I tell 'em two thousand two million
A rider without a motor, you got it right I'm a solider
Long as it's loaded I'ma tote it
I told ya, flow so cold, below frozen
like ice water over the Pro Tools
But that's old news, update the topic
What makes the prophet cut cake in projects
I'ma show him how cupcake his squad is
Duct tape embalmers for makin' them comments

Beef it really ain't a problem, one call, half of your boys X'd out
Jail ain't rehabilitate shit!
Killers and dealers all I affiliate with
Retaliate and I squeeze mags, you hit you went stiff
and we ain't playin' freeze tag, you better dip
Chop soundin' like a speed bag, that's it, set a date money I'm hungry
So I'm robbin' moms for that wake money
It's Torch, you get a bomb from me, you wan' play?
I survived more athletes than Barry Bonds trainin'
Name 'em, ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Miss a payment I'll be waitin' there, takin' all your favorite shit
Earrings, rings, watches, bracelets
Chains and the flat screen, shawty that 'llac mean

Rick Ross,"[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life , nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Rick Ross]
Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye
Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sitting at this table, why, to take this 
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side (right)
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a Z (good lookin' nigga)
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'ma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lot of good niggas in the game
But in the game, all the good niggas get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them things
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

Never try me like a thug
If you do you better duck
I'ma hit em' in his body,
Somebody patching you up
I'ma bust a nigga head,
Somebody wrapping you up
When I ask you for ma shit,
Nigga am I asking too much?
Ridin' dirty in ma Seven deuce

I'm dirtier than a reverend
Fighting internal revenue

You can call me Uncle Sam
Used ya for your services,
And I don't give a damn
Slap bush with ma stash
All these taxes and this cash
Got these bitches selling ass
Homicide for the cash

Twenty birds on this surb
Posted up on the curb
Got a lot of pistol game

But I'ma get him marked off
for no less than a quarter key
Yea I broke him off,
Now I gotta break him off
He think he using his head,
I gotta take it off
Therefore I'm loosing his head
And then I'm taking off
Mashing in the grand national
Wont break it off
Lemme break it down
I see fifty off a chicken
Every time I break it down
Bad little Bitches shake it
when they break it down
Lemme break it down
I Broke it down,
To the smallest slab
Cause I'm so fat
I got the fiends calling cabs
I'm out here for my stacks

Pressure they bust pipes

When Boobie had the realest nigga feeling like a bitch
They go for 20, I was gettin 'em for the 17
A lil' G', look at me, I was 17
Born on the side of town where them killers ride around
Pull up on the block with a block, gon tie it down
Pistol in his pants and he stand like ""Fuck you""
I'm from the other side where we ride like a bus do
Thrity-six O-Z's got me riding Lexus
Chevy at the crib, get the weed shit from Texas
Dade County D-Boy, deals on the yayo
Triple C the mafia, they kill when I say so
Before I wrote a song I controlled the zone
I had to feed myself but bitch I was on my own
Now I push shit bigger than the president
I'm at the white house known as my residence

[Chorus:]
I'm in the white house (house!), I'm in the white house (house!)
I call the shots, I could get yo ass wiped out
We in the white house (house!), we in the white house (house!)
Big Fantom on the lawn getting wiped down
I'm in the white house (house!), I'm in the white house (house!)
I got a hundred of them things nigga, right now
We in the white house (house!), we in the white house (house!)
I got them hoe's getting on blow right now

I don't fuck with pussy niggas, took my shit to Jigga man
I went to Manhattan and came home a young millionaire
Money on mind, I'm a trill nigga anyway
I'll slap a pussy ass nigga down for anything
Motherfuck the other side, pussy niggaz bleed pink
That's my opinion, wanna know what the chopper think?
We loading up them things, boy! I'm a head busta
Motherfuck the music nigga, where ya real muscle?
I'm in the white house, I'm in the white house
I put a hit on them niggas they getting wiped out
They getting wiped out, and not one at a time
""Car full of dead black males"" read the head line

I'm the fruit of the loom, I be flyin in lears
Gimme food and I boom, supplying for years
I'm on top of the world, I'm gettin money
Hundred grand in a day, easy I'm getting money!
Pull up real slow, I let the haters watch
Out of state plates, they in a state of shock
You niggas go and fish, I got a plate of shark
You better play your part, you ain't gotta play a part
Got a AK that'll tear ya whole day apart
That stick'll make 'em sit like a Saint Bernard
I'm in the white house, time to close shop
Military wiped out, boy that was thirty blocks

Riding with them big things, lookin' like a bomb threat

Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro
She wanna gaze at the stars
Through a panoramic view, pullin' haze out the jar
Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh
Getting blessed on the ?, it's a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind
We came from trigger play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow your mind

All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts
I see the vision, from club vision to ?
I get brain, I bust nuts in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's, there it goes
Baby girl, come talk with the boss
I pop a Jose bottle, you can kick your shoes off

Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think bout it

When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)

Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)
This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move with

Got big plans but you leave em in suspense

And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops

But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light

Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light

Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

I started flat broke, now I'm poppin' rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club poppin', Ima burn a hundred grams
Check the parking lot pimpin', whip cost a hundred grand

I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game for all you thousand airs
It's funny sour D's will smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street

I'm sittin' twelve feet, fuck, can you tell me
I let the 12's beat, 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
So don't fall asleep 'cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak, they know I'm spittin' cheese

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

We got them bottles poppin' soundin' like they gun shots
Got the models balkin', did it all with one watch
I hit a lot markets, start 'em off with one block
People love the product, so my people come to shop

My uncle, 65, he still sellin' dope
He claim he petrified, the field goin' broke
It's them Caddy Seville's, went from acid to pills
To elaborate deals if you want status you kill

'Cause they have it for real when I step in the spot
Treat the club like the charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes
And ya know I'm strapped, I'ma play by the rules

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

Take the good with the bad, in the club blowin' your last
Ballin' like I violated, bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, parachute to prevail
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell 'em take it easy

Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantasy
Left her panties at home standin' there thick as can be
Are I see K are O S S, standin' there dressed fresh
Gettin' pussy, hell yes, Ross, Ross

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

No it's not the solid treatment I let's the bitch vibe
Fire up the kush she hit it now this?
Now imagine how she look with carties and thick thighs
Put her on the payroll 'cause flat out she get's down
See that ass from the side that's before she sits down
And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Crystal
Niggas lookin' at me, pa but I'm packin' a pistol
Fuck kicked out, bitch I'm tearin' this shit down
Yeah my Chevy sittin' high so it's hard to get down
Watch that dick standin' up, girl it's hard to get down
Got them chickens in the dress so I hardly sit down
Some problem Alphabet Boys get them charges to stick now

You know we gettin' money by the way a nigga dress

Chickens pullin' on my shirt I'm just worried about the chains
Tattoos cover everything except the dark frames
Canceling all of this I debut LeBron James
Came back Mike Vick I buried ya dog brains

I won't let the roof up, kingdom come, prince is a?
To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling for me to be loved
Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit,
So it's music to my ears every time I feel a clip,
I'm a card shark up in a hard rock, twenty grand a hand baby jam in the Ipod?

Got me a white girl, I fuck till her face red,

Step in goosebumps i'm the main event
Got a pocket full of game bring the main intent
Six bitches phone numbers on the same napkin
Now thats what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it, these niggas living off the pad

Rick Ross,"Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, b****es hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just f***ed around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus]

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
N**** on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f***
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf***er I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the s***
I gets what the f*** I want so what I trick
Fat a** burgundy bags cla**y s*** Jimmy Choo shoes

Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!

I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!

And get into it

Rick Ross,"(To deal with a dude like me baby. You gotta be the H.B.I.C.
The head bitch in charge calling all the shots baby.
Can't be scared to gamble.
Gotta roll the dice.
Feel me? Scared money don't make none.)

Shorty look I know my ego looking forty foot.
Big chain and not talking bout the naughty look.
Mine Gotti unless I'm looking for the sporty look.
He young and rich and bitch that go without a argument.
My kicks brown and now I'm looking for Rhianna n' dem'.
Smoke junky, kush funkier than parliament.
What's the problem then girl fuck apartments.
Move in with me on the beach now your top ten.
You can do the spa
See a newer car.
These my feelings and I'm really feeling who you are.
Baby light brown, with the right smile.
First lady and she ready for the White House.

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Baby you, you shine just like I do.
Just like your supposed to.
Everyone knows your the bosses girl.
My diamond, envy of all yo friends.
Big moves that we're making.
Got us on top of the world.
Your the bosses girl.
(I got nothing but love for you baby)
Baby your the bosses girl
(I love to pay yo bills baby)
Oh
(It excites me! You know what I'm talking bout?)

Fresh limousines, tall waterfalls.
Valet at the crib, my cars I love em' all.
Boss Lady, she the head bitch in charge.
She asks for head first so she gets it off top.
Champagne pop, rubber band knots.
Multi-millionaire no that other man not.
Let her call the shots, she want me on the top.
And the way I want it, it will be a month before I stop.
Kinda walk funny.
Stubble out the bed
Snap of her finger niggas picking up her tabs.
Walking through the mall got me carrying her bags.
I gotta pause cause this motherfuckers bad.

[Chorus:]
Baby you, you shine just like I do.
Just like your supposed to.
Everyone knows your the bosses girl.
My diamond, envy of all ya friends
Big moves that we're making.

Your the bosses girl

Baby your the bosses girl
(Feels good when you say it)
Your the bosses girl
(I love you baby)

Cursing down Collins, knocking Trick Daddy.
When I'm upset all my niggas trigga happy.
Do me a favor, watch your behavior.
Cause I'm insane send you straight to yo Savior.
Looking at my savings baby I can save ya.
Take ya parasol and go straight to Jamaica.
Ya man a boti boy, with the bumbaclots.
You deserve better,
6 car garage,
Come in late night
So I'm airport.
As I take flight,
I'm ya Air Jordan.
We the world champs.
Come and ball with us
Gotta take my time when I put my all in her.

Tellin' lies getting niggas wives tied up and raped
Similar to tha mob deeper than a rap
All you niggas gettin' robbed all the cellphones tapped
Bullet in my head, bullet in my chest
Yea they want a nigga dead
They envy my success

Shorty what's on your brain, 'cause whatever is clever
Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar
This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather
Run a few errands (Ross), summers in Paris
Never shopping in clearance, don't make me embarrassed
She never a bird, but baby my parrot
Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots
My house is her home, I made her a palette
Maybe being too modest, my shit more like a palace
Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter

See shawty laid back, so we laid up
When I fade to black, we always made up
This shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of
Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors
Have 700s, first one to get it
My car's a virgin, first one to hit it
Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood
Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feeling good
Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip
I'ma hit the club, I'ma buy the VIP
We spending money, I'm talking slick
I hope she ride me, I'm talking stick

Rick Ross,"I got a feeling nigga really that my money be the root
Look up at the stars she like honey where the roof?
Pull up hear the dogs canaries they goin roof
Even once had a job pouring tar up on a roof
That boy had it hard no facade its the truth
So now when I Menage and get massaged its the proof
Proofs in the pudding and that baking sodas taking
Paper that I'm making got her taking photos naked
Listening to niggas like whistling at Wendy Williams
I flip my middle finger I'm chilling on 20 million
The rumors turn me on I'm masturbating at the top
These hoes so excited they catching every drop
I'm dodging the debacles like pot holes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed bury the paper on them acres
Martin had a dream bob got high I still do both but somehow I got by

Creflo pray Mike Vick payed bobby brown stray Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on the pad when I write
That Mayweather money looking funny in the light
But who really cares we just throw it in the air
Celebrating wealth pouring moet in her hair
Excuse me her weave the blue is a weave
Trunk full of white car smell like blue cheese
That boy get salad beef bout movements
BM dubs on them big things looking foolish
Shawty sitting low big things popping
Tip on the glock from a crip up in Compton shooting at the cops
Fuck one time I gave her to the block
I fucked 1 time we boys in the hood and nigga you lil trey
Suppress ya appetite we taking ya lil' tray
Love my handgun but my chopper still the shit
Banned in 1994 but I'm to legit to quit
1996 kilos was the shit but that be better then roofing that shit be bad for ya skin
Niggas was ruthless and lord knows that I've sinned
But I thought about my future in the loops I could pin
Walked out on a gig and I turned to the streets
Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks
I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for the city but now everybody mad at me
Motherfuck em all they sweat from my balls
If I drop another album I did that for my dogs
10 Maybach's everybody riding big
I just sit back like look what I did
Then I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer everybody back to business

Smoking on a blunt in my own restaurant people looking from a distance think I'm big daddy kunk
Reincarnated spirit of a g beef ill make u dinner take a seat so we could eat
A Farrakhan aura paws on the pork you eat from the bowl while ya dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal snakes slithered in they coil im laughing at you
Cause kill you niggas when I'm bored

We stepping on ya crew until you motherfuckers crush
And making sweet love to every women that you lust
I love to pay her bills can't wait to pay her rent Curtis Jackson baby mama
I ain't asking for a cent
Burn the house down gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can jealous stupid motherfucker
To another chapter paper that I captured
Caught up in the rapture off of gunshots and laughter
Homicide is humor and nigga you looking funny
Women love to stare cause they know they see the money
I open up my mind by opening bank accounts deposit a 100 stacks
Break up wont take it out baby that's a gift maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but I just like to give used to run the street
Young nigga bare feet now I'm in the suites and I'm eating crab meats

I laugh while I'm doin' laps in the swimmin' pool

I don't owe you niggas nothin'
Call me two fingers when you see a nigga stuntin'
Black Philip drummin', limousines of the Hummer
Penthouse sweet, pretty beach I call the summer

Lotta homies pass, see 'em in the future
Moneys so fast, on the gas, never neutral
Gotta keep a shooter while I'm ridin' in the seven
Higher than a kite by the time I get to heaven

Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush

Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it

You know us we the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block wanna take us
'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us we the usual suspects

And still my talent is yet to be challenged
Had new jet with my own pilot
No blastin' off, but flexin' DJ Khaled
My mom stressin' college but my crude sense of logic
Did a lude to my empty wallet

Try spittin' on a green tinted Accord
Which could mean a sentence up north
Where the homie was but back then
Doe was like a hoard it goldie love, it didn't exist
And office foley cuffs was after my wrists

Was not Beverly hills where we chilled
Imagine this, the nas 'n' rith had to get from rags to rich
I used to stand on rooftops, with two glocks
Figurin' how do I turn my timbalands to clocks

Now reptiles was left out about a watch
What is you thinkin'? Murk you
Plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothin' to me
If you thuggin, a fake and shaked on Cuban, shout out my Ricans
Down with all of you gangstas to the roughest Jamiacans

Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush

If you ballin' physics, nigga money never flow
Meanin' every day I'm livin', tryna stay on flow
Coming from a boss, I can predict a double cross
Handlers managin' money, they never come across

I spend in Africa, Magnamers, numbers involved
AK47s singin' win or by sum or you fall?
I dealt with brawls and those willin' to sell their soul
Over cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes

Ask ma feddi grow, fuck a feet of spaghettio's
I'm club poppin' in Cali shout out to Ariel
Somebody dim the lights, triple black tuts
'Cause associated and the flesh is tryna catch up

I roam with niggas who destined to get a life sentence
Get their baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits
Ma nigga got a dub an' love to do the push ups
I got a million cash tryna get the kush up

Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush

He's not bigga than biggie, bitch I'm bigger than you
Just a boat to mi casa like you a milli or 2
Gotta kick off your shoes, okay lets take a cruise
Here's my captain now relax, let him do what he do
Okay, who rolling spinach? cause I'm reeling the anchor
Smoke up up an acre a grass wake up in Jamaica
Couple nautical miles, I call my cubanos to cop
Puerto Rico for women, hit Barbados to shop
Living larger than life call this the yacht club
Before ya join us bitch ya gotta get your stax up
Shes walking back and forth, shes just itchen to fuck
And then I heard her whisper: ""Girl you know he 's rich as fuck""
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
If he indulgen jealousy his ass better breathe
Man overboard cause hes goin overboard
Damn its over for him put that on my vocal chord.

There's a party (party)

All the girls them welcome

Kill all the middle men im the millatin gilligans
Speaking creole and gentle men as I cruise the Caribbean
Oh Lord I'm a star down in saint barths
The fat Tommy Lee I made out with like 8 broads
Put up in Costa Rica, I get the most of features
She no speakay no englay, maybe Fat Joe could teach her
Smoking barrels of reefer, only the yacht club
Before ya join us bitch ya gotta get your stax up
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
When we started selling keys that's just how we thought it would be
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes
I'm the greater genius no reference to the ugly clothes
I still hustle for dope, but no more me scuffing my
Soles
Make the presentation and trust me the customer sold
I'm cruising in the gulf, I think your so deaf
Janet was in control, because the hoe left

My dick a big stretch and quick ta tell a bitch fetch
Tell you to kiss her ass, after you bought the bitch breast
Her head above average, my head above water
But now you could see my balace right off the coast of Florida
Im in ta fine fish with a slight lime twist
Veggies on the side of course, kush appetizez
Let your Mercedes chill, roll wit a navy seal
This the yacht club, wanna trust me your lady will,
Still spillen champagne, or is it merlow
Fuck it its fine wine, my bitch a vergo
I don't do the signs, unless there dollars on em
I'm the boss a theboat, cashmere collar on em,
Thinking a last year and all the moneys made
Now its corporate invest in, and amongst the other things
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes

Rick Ross,"I got a feelin' nigga rillin' and my money be the root
Look up at da stars she like, honey where the roof?
Pull up, hear the dogs, canaries dey go on roof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on the roof

Dat boy had it hard no facade, it's da truth
So now when I menage and get massaged just to proof
Proofs in dat pudding & dat bakin' sodas takin'
Paper dat would make take dem photos naked

Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wiggie Williams
I flip my middle finga I'm chillin' on 20 million
Da room has turned me on I'm masterbatin' at da top
These hoes so excited so dey catchin' every drop

I'm dodgin' the barcols like pot holes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the makers
Martin had a dream, Bob got high
I still do both but somehow I got by

Treflo prayed, Mike Vick payed
Bobby Brown stray, Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write
Dat may why they money lookin' funny in the light

But who really cares if you just throw it in the air
Celebratin' wealth pourin' Moet in her hair
Excuse me her weave the blue is her weed
Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese

Dat boy get salad beef bow movement
BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin' foolish
Shawty sittin' low big thangs poppin'
Tip on da glock from a crip up in Compton

Shootin' at da cops, fuck 1 time
I gave her to da block, I fucked 1 time
We boys in da hood and nigga you lil trey
So press ya appetite we takin' ya lil tray

Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit
Banned in 1994 but I'm 2 legit 2 quit
99 to 6 kilos was the shit
But dat were batter den roofin' dat shit be bad for ya skin

Niggas was ruthless and Lord knows dat I've sinned
But I thought about my future in the loops like a pin
Walked out on da gig and I turned to da streets
Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks

I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me
Mothafuck 'em all and sweat from my balls
If I drop anotha album I did dat for my dogs

10 Maybachs everybody ridin' big
I just sit back like, look what I did
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer everybody back to business

Smokin' on a blunt in my own restaurant
People lookin' from a distance think I'm big daddy cunk
Reincarnated spirit of a G
Beef'll make you dinner take a seat so we could eat

A Farrakhan aura, paws on the port
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered and dey coil
I'm laughin' at you 'cause, I kill you niggas when I'm bored

We steppin' on ya crew until you mothafukkas crush
And make da sweet love to every women dat you lust
I love to pay her bills can't wait to pay her rent
Curtis Jackson baby mama I ain't askin' for a cent

Burn the house down, gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can, jealous stupid muthafuka
To another chapter, paper dat I captured
Caught up in da rapture off of gunshots and laughter

Homicide is zooming and nigga you lookin' funny
Women love to stare 'cause dey know dey see da money
I open up my mind about openin' bank accounts
Deposit a 100 stacks break up now take it out

Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but I just like to give
Used to run da street, young nigga bare feet
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin' crab meats

Ice so right other rappers envy

Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I

I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me wit a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby, that will take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid

So we back to playin' tennis
We been goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore
So I tried it in aurar

Conscience intervened concentrating on my cream
I'm tha king, make a move, pawns all tha way to queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me

All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin' to breathe air

All she do is hear the pipes

Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute then now we countin' digits
Maybach money, so I always had a vision
I would always tell ma niggas but ain't nobody listened

Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
There ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive, Def Jam's ever seen

Only yours dream, Sean John suit and a S Dot ring
Sean Don for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, masspike on a two
Gunplay, he a glue goon wit a attitude

Ye start wit 305 but we end at four pounds

All them Carol City killers, feel liking you broke down
Money is a must tommy guns on a bus

Allan Zamren on the case, so you know what you can suck
Wear red all the time but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga, throw up a dollar sign
One time for tha Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip

But it's time to rape tha game like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub still smokin'

I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin bitches that's dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit
Real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love.

[Chorus]

I say, how can they compare to you
Everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So I let others shit you on dead, burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you
Like the sound and I ain't ever try tuning you
But now I'm just assuming you
Living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio 'cause everything was fair play
1st class herm ass
Panamera perp pass
Greed written on her face
When I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck
It was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

[Chorus]",Play Your Part
Rick Ross,"You know getting money?
Becoming the young millionaire.
You could lose sight of the things that is important to ya.

I'd never trade my old girl 
For all the money in the world.
I'd never trade my daughter Toya 
For all the money in the world.
I'd never trade my only boy 
For all the money in the world.
I put my last name first!

I can hear my Daddy saying, ""Lil' nigga go get 'em!""
Passed in '99 cancer all up in his liver.
Shit, difference is since we last spoke his son's a lil' richer.
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him.
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him?
Bust his ass, just want to break bread with him.
Crying in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture.
It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas.
Being the only boy, definition of a man.
All the money in the world still not a big enough advance.
All the money in the world still not big enough advance.
For me to turn my back on me being the man that I am.

I gotta stay focused and remain a little soldier.
Brace a few wishes and the streets begin the whisper.
Praying for you niggas still stocking up my pistols.
Lil' nigga getting murdered and buried in all white.
8th grade student y'all figure that's alright.
Trying to figure out where I'm going with my life.
As I'm stepping on the brake and hangin' a sharp right.
Did my thing in the streets, 
Seen in the streets 
See me at the park on the swing with my niece.
Watch chipped up, still won't switch up.
First time singing, so you gotta turn the bitch up.

When I close my eyes 
I can see you about a million times.
Its true, over and over (over and over).
Yea, but then again, 
It kinda makes me laugh 
Cause you're the one that put me on this path.
I guess I gotta keep rolling strong.
I feel I can't go wrong.

Because I can hear you talking with me.
I can hear you talking to me.
I know you hear them saying

Old memories won't go away I remember them like it was yesterday
Bad times never felt so good, can't forget about you man, I never never would.
Old memories won't go away I remember them like it was yesterday
Bad times never felt so good, can't forget about you man, I never never would.

Old memories won't go away I remember them like it was yesterday
Bad times never felt so good, can't forget about you man, I never never would.
Say I never ever would

Let me slow down

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin' with some rich niggas
We done lost symbols speakin' cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold

I embark on life; my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand the folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal

Uh, it's just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo

Free Mason
Free Lancer
Free Agents
We faster
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I'm the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce--guess you made it nigga
All-white neighborhood; you they favourite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK
So, so I JFK
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing so fuck it
I'll do it mentally

Niggas couldn't do nothing with me; they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer; I don't know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn my music up
Hear me clearly: if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell; this is God engineering
This is Hail Mary pass; y'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing that I made it though the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me; I never would've made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red hot; I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard; I'm a bad motherfucker
It's 'hov; hust say you love it

[Chorus]

If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win
Never, never say
Never say Legend didn't go in (I'm-a go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Makin' love to my favorite girl
Or makin' beautiful music

Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty
Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city
Load up the choppers like it's December thirty first
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
Told em my partna' and help them crackas give 'em thirty
I told 'em I got 'em, therefore I gotta do ya dirty
Back on my Benz, been in these bitches 8:30
Scoot me a dime, now man get off at 10:30
Goin' on 12, go home and tell that man a lie
I got a bake sale, bitches thirty for the pie
9 for the slice, dummy that's a Dan Marino
Talkin' quarterbacks mean ya talkin' quarter kilos

I'm a player catchin' bitches like I'm T.O.
Trunk full of work, yea this nigga think he Neno
Three dice yea, grab a nigga for a kilo
Pinky ring a hundred grand but keep that on the d-low
Diddy negotiates and the paperwork to T.O
My niggas never sing if I need 'em I go to neo
Fuck a famous bitch then I treat her just like a ski-oh

Mommy that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida happy though
Die young but fuck it, we flew first class
Turned you to a rich bitch buy you first class
Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen
Every time we hit the charts niggas shoot up like a 'feign (Unn)
Stuntin' like we printin' money wit' machines
Which you see me wavin' Visorone Constantine (Uh)

Twenty fo' carat gold, baby carats worth of ice

Shoppin' in Milan, hoppin' out the van

And we 'bout to hit Jacob the jeweler
So I could be like Slick Rick and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King Jr.
And I'm a never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit's so disrespectful
You could gon' ahead and sneeze 'cause my presence blessed you
I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know it's superficial and ya say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressin' room
The store just froze
And I know, they trying to get their cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin' ""How you do that?""
So they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight I loved every minute

They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well, we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit for rest of our lives

Look around Maserati's for the whole team
Look at Haiti, children dyin' 'round the clock nigga
I sent a hundred grand but that's a decent watch nigga
I'm gettin' better 'cause it would've leased the drop nigga
I'm a get my money right just watch nigga
She had a miscarriage I couldn't cry though
'Cause you and I know she was only my side hoe

Time to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer
See the links and you just think Jesus
I'm hot till a day a day freezes

Took many to awards
Shook never before and for my mother I applaud

Still, you know the dope won't stop
If I die today bury me in a dope ass watch

No denim on my seats, baby you gon' need a towel
Ride sexy through the city, see me you will be aroused
My bankroll so well endowed, 
Pull bitches from M-I-A to A-T-L in style
And in crowds catch me in town, on the strip in Vegas
Chilling, filling bitches faces with babies
Bitch bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes
Tell the A.T.F. I'm riding with another 3-80
That's my car cost, y'all thought I would fall off
That was just a small loss, we can have a ball off
Fly to N.Y., meet me at the Waldorf
Historian architecture Victorian
Riding in the past like you're driving a DeLorean
Hard times, never heard of those in the 'Bach
My feet kicked up, get my dick sucked with the curtains closed
And for the record kid, my final question is
How your bitch gon' feel in that 
When you two pull up next to this?
Ha ha ha ha, Maybach Music nigga!

But guess who stays the same? You gon' see my name
Stroll real slow, with the curtains low

Yo, piff that I'm blowing on is fucking up the ozone
Plus I keep a dope line similar to Cold Stone's
Ice cream, pipe dreams
Is what they have when I pull up in that light thing
I put a hurting on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't getting shitted on, I'm squirting on
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the health
Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt
Live for your kids, die for yourself
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothing else

Japanese wheel blades all samurai
Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side

Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss it
I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things and a mobile home
Money machines, yeah they ring like a mobile phone
I'm a seven-up, I need a coca-cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere hand-made sweater

My top back, I'm circumcised
I pull it back just to go inside
She thinking 'folic, I'm thinking wings stop
Feigning lemon pepper, I got my thing cocked

Throwin' spit, throwin' up respect, and I'm well-connected

Hawaii, hand glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hos
Rare bottles by the barrel
Poppin' Giuseppe tags like it's American Apparel
20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andale, andale, baby, move fast
She drop it down and bring it back; I like that
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
So she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back

All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

Women of a caliber
Only seen in magazines and calendars
And I'm sitting with Miss October
'Cause my birthday's in October
Strawberry and her Rose on
I can see it in her eye as she wink and she toast me
And later on we gonna mosey
To a place where less populated and get cozy

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss; take a look

Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

Rick Ross,"Smoking the best spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Staring in the streets so I don't sleep much
Watching the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' dis money niggas cant keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it cant be much
I'm still walking through the crowds like I cant be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the muthafucka'
No insurance on a muthafucka'
Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody knows I'm a a lot of people's threats
Biggie smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me lord will I be dealing dope
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only lords knows

To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god, I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Young rich muthafucka' still uneducated but dammit a nigga made it
God damn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers Lord know I'm stressed
A punch in the face get you 300 K
Ask Blair Knight he back makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimming in ice
I'm just living my life
I'm just living my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next mournin' I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

Goodbye
To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this
Not to dwell on the the past
But to keep it real I gotta represent for Emmitt Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin' at my Rolly it's about that time
White man got a problem wit' mine
And we suppose to be shy
The revolutions televised
Bobby still on the rise

Goodbye
To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind

Better start taking notes as I'm taking tokes

My vision always mentioned coke
My women never sit in coach

Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil
These boys going blind they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a key
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease
These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my toolie
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas acting like they want a war!
When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm riding in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report
Amsterdam state of mind, I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

I'm speaking on unwritten laws the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into
At a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business

It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We green light you bitch niggas

Rozay!",Amsterdam
Rick Ross,"Yea, such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year
Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear
Count new money, peeling out a venue
New Maybach after it was discontinued
Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives
Maybach IV the allure that I adore
All money game, we got ones in the floor
See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game
Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames
Bow to the boss in the presence of a don
Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin
Playing my position for a club that I can join
Never in the draft, but that boy know he going
Throw me a bone, get me a brick
That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch
She's showing some potential, so we taking trips
Nigga, assets last while memories fade
I'ma patch that ass I don't get paid
I'm a Mike Tyson type of, typewriter sniper
Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper
I love when the beat dip
Same way I love to see a key flip
Go and pay your mama house off
Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off
I'm alive, you could never write the South off
South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw
Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth, wha?
Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw
Pulling up slow, look at that boy
Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour
Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me
All the g's with me, Maybach Eazy-E

The good times don't last long
Just rewind the last song
We all shared some great times
As I read some great rhymes

What we does, is what dreams are made of
Come and get your love, all of this love

500 for the car that I got on the strip
That's another 100, what I got on my wrist
800 for the jar that I'm about to twist
It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch
As I get high, move my curtains to the side
Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die
Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate

Dreams, everything that we are
The life that we're living, baby it's ours
Dreams, money, homes, and cars
Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy
Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh
Baby come with me and live the dream

It's a whole nother different element
It's Maybach roman numeral four
You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this
You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this

I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
You'll be making it come true
I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
You'll be making it come true
I'll be dreaming of you

Dear Lord
Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us
And look down upon us with forgiveness
For all the sins we will have in the future

We try to keep our heads up in bad times
This is a bad time
Show us the way
And if you can't show us the way
Then forgive us for being lost",Pray for Us

Follow me

I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mill so many times, I contemplated
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sippin' purple and that muthafucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh)
We so sophisticated (Ugh)
Shit so sophisticated (Woop)
Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh)

I'm so sophisticated
Smoking weed, busting open dolla liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it's activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated 'cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it
I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET
My lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for 10 a key
And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas ""C'est la vie""

This the mob so you gotta get initiated

Shittin' on these haters, ball hard D-Waders
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yea I'm in my bag
And these nigg** so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash, my bitch so bad, she know sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain't got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment

Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producing the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they toting them thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted the range
I needed some change, mama needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feeling the same, all these criminals paid
Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm selling dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was calling them plays, you were still in the bleachers
Booby gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roaming the block, car missing the top
Meaning missing a roof, hope you listening y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I travelled that road
Went from walking on gravel, now I'm riding on vogues
50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Court side seats with the franchise
I think about my niggas doing 25
Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize?

I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poise
First you stack you some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringing them pistols
Have her singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I rather smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until the day I'm slain, the commission remains
Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

Straight Grim Reaper, Air Jordans walking the streets
Blackberry boss one call, ya put to sleep

I'm rolling the dice, four, five, six
Young nigga, nineteen, forty five bricks
Praying on you niggas, sinners full of hate
God forgives and I don't, only hustlers relate

The Lord is my light and my salvation
But I see none of you fuck niggas
Fuck what you heard, nigga
I need to feel it
I need to smell it
I need to see it",Pirates
Rick Ross,"Get Money! Get Money!

Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential

You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming
Bilie Jean thumping
I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning
I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something
I could ship her something, you know that December coming

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

They see me leaning in some new shit
Now it's gold presidentials for the cruise ship
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold presidential Venus when I change the game

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

She wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 know we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talking that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers until the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
White T, gold Rolex

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible
I feel solely responsible",Presidential
Rick Ross,"When 16 ain't enough

It's funny niggas, it's been on my mind lately
When 16 ain't enough, having a dope beat, dope idea
16 bars ain't enough!
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?
You know, so many different levels, when 16 ain't enough, to living your life
Depicting with your wordplay, when 16 ain't enough, exactly what life means to you
16 ain't enough

I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one

Huh, it's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash
John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville, feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one 16 ain't enough
Talking that fast money 15 every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steamin' my marijuana
Double MGs, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga, government cheese
Yachts and Yacht Masters, Old Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat paper that I'm stackin'
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Livin' like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys, damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the 16
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watchin' on the big screen
3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean

When 16 ain't enough, you know how sometimes you got so much to say but
When 16 ain't enough, they on they only give you 16, heh
Man it's like I mean I got so much to say ya know
The world has said so much to me, I just wanna give right back to 'em you know
When 16 ain't enough, but I only get 16, that's like a cage you know
When 16 ain't enough, I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse
That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse
Just a page
But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking

Summer '88, or was it '89
Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind
I'm in my room, boomin' drawin' LL Cool J album covers
With crayolas on construction paper
I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before Le marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my palms would cake up
Before they told me they love me and we'll never breakup
Before the time she makes love, to someone that I thought was, my homeboy
But boy was, I wrong now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfor-tunately
But of course an assort-ment of tor-ches that scor-ches the skin, when they enter
Intru-ders, whose tutors did a lousy job
How's he god if he let's Lucifer let loose on us
That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I admit it, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it like
We know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em, hint hint, it ain't um Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Y'all can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smiles
With such a devilish grin, Like ""where the hell have you been""
She yelling that selling’s a sin, well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin, if you don’t offer new ways to win
A dolphin gone shake his fin, regardless if he is in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
I miss the days that O' and Market Hole had scowl on his arm?
And I set off these alarms, when camera’s snap snap snap snap
Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa
They’ll learn why, near privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws till they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don’t like em don’t pretend to
Yea something tells me, we ain’t in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
All the women you been pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh yeah, oh yeah

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh (When 16 ain't enough) yeah, oh yeah (When 16 ain't enough)

(Break down, break down) Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?
Yea, ha ha

(I love it) Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac 'cause I'm black and put them works in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman yeah?

It's funny because, cause you're a changer
But because we love you, we go that extra mile, break it down for 'em Andre huh,

Rick Ross,"God forgives, He's so honourable
But living amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury

I wake up excited, I made it through the night
Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?
My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows that my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong
My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down
Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut)
Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)
Shopping for them Os when the mall close
Repping for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)
Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand
Lord ? got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holding on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice
All these jewels on, all ?
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lacklustre
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black minded
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail them, motherfucking killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest
Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean
Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back in
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them
I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I rhyme
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Hope you know that I'm strapped like I supposed to be
Put a number on your helmet like it's Notre Dame
5 grand'll get you whacked, won't even know your name
Road to the riches until I'm paid in full
And the Lord is my witness we making major moves
God forgives and I don't, I got it tatted in my skin
I'm going straight to hell that's if ballin' is a sin

I got work from Argentina and Belize in the crib
Homie holding a nina, could sneeze him a brick
Knee-deep in the cocaine, trees in the six
Biggie on the stereo, seven-digit flips
The scenario: something go wrong, it's a burial
Hit the hood, watch it go around like a merry-go
White seats, new M5, all cherry though
Heard you at Aces, Courvoisier
Toasting the niggas that beat cases
Knowing your connect on a name-to-name basis
Eating with your fam on a day-to-day basis
Weight shit, get the big house and the spaceship
Team of loyal niggas
That'll fucking boil niggas for a chain or a bracelet
Nigga, you know I'm living fly
For the love of the game, I put a ribbon on the pie

Heli-pad on my crib, my money outta here
Love my daughter to death, ten karats in her ear
Heavy ammunition for you fuck boys

I'm floating in my shit like I'm in a parade
Ho, you better take notes, I spent ten on the paint
Waving at these bitches, and I know these niggas ho-ish
Take your bitch to get lemon pepper in a new Lotus
I'm so rich, I mean I'm so rich
If it's less than ten stacks, to me it's ho shit

Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice

Dark thoughts clouding my mind
And I open the drawer and I see two things:
I see the warm Tod loafers
I see the crisp cashmere socks
And I know that today is going to be a good day
A hundred dollars a sock

Two ankles, you do the math

Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'
Back of the phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch, now you want to know the name of it
Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cuz it ain't buzzin'
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at
Your man got murked, but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie, rose gold cost 40
Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once I'm screaming YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I
Ciroc, no glass, smiling women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives taking pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves
Rich forever in my D-Boy ways
So dope, blue jeans, new J's
Sold dope by any means all day

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever

100 mil ain't enough
Got 100 women, gotta deal with it, love
Worth 40 m's is he still dealing drugs
Cigarette speedboats, but he's still with the thugs
Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday
Grinding, even be legit one day
Order some more bottles because I'm on one
I know her pussy wet, and she wanna cum
She wanna cum, maybe come over
Stop dealing with them niggas you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
'Cause you know a nigga rich forever

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever

On the way we shed some tears
Every day we sacrifice
We gon' be rich forever",Rich Forever
Rick Ross,"Aye, I'm bout to leave the studio bout 2:30 baby
You can just hit me back then, you know what I'm sayin'?

I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring

Diamonds are forever, she my bitch forever
Had my back forever, I was in that trap forever
All the lonely nights, I was chasin' cheddar
Now I got her movin' white, now it's like whatever
Put down that bus pass she got her some Porsche keys
Got her a Birkin bag, earrings for 40 G's
Sex keep on getting better, cause she keep gettin' wetter
Got her that sexy condo, nothing can separate us
When I'm in Chi-Town, I'm just a call away
Or on the West Coast, lost like I'm Marvin Gaye
I put up the Phantom, time to chill in Atlanta
She say I'm her future before she peel off them panties

Lemme be the one you call when it's time to be a freak

Crib big as Turner Field so you know we rich forever
Diamonds in a bezel, smokin' on this leather
No my grind couldn't be better, and she thick as ever
I got killers in Decatur, as well as Dade County
She in cribs with elevators, as well as water fountains
How we move can't be debated, the hustle well rounded
Talking square feet, master suite, 12,000

Lemme be the one you call when it's time to be a freak

Rick Ross,"Its time to take it to the other side
The side you gotta watch A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit

I'm not a star
But thats a lie
I've seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testify
Spoke on a homicide
Amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams

A project minded individual criminal tactics
Us blacks kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
Mentally sex-crazed dysfunctional they describe us
They liars, the end of the day, we fucking survivors
I remember watching Scarface the first time
Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to peoples in my mind
They dumb to destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In a bastardized nation, Magnum 4.5 carrying
Where I'm from, ain't far from Washington Heights the cop Aryan
A rookie boy the cookie didn't make no profit
A stranger to the block I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
I brought it back to poppy, ain't tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses
He gives me powder he has faith in Nas'
Ambition's to distribute coke
Had additions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes
But I'm again broke
This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers they up their orders
Barely at 62 they already up they quotas
They out there everyday, some true hustlas for ya
I'm at it halfway, none of my customers are loyal
Picturin' piping out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy cash, the flash diamonds
My junior high school class, wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur I got my grades there
Blaming society, man it wasn't made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse and so I was
Throwin' rocks at the pen just for the love
Evil the secret life of G's
You seeing my blurry, triple beam dreams

Pocketful of money, parking lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens they got cameras every angle
Dope been coming so you know the income major
Rule number 1 I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers coming when I feel in danger
Early nineties reminiscing when I had a pager
Triple Beam Dreams now Pat Riley my neighbor

Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
In a court room spraying like a germ nigga
25 on a line, them niggas dropping dimes
Cooperation got them red necks dropping time
Khaki suits and them niggas got to acting cute
We was all cool stacking them Acura coupes
More accurately we acted as if jackin' was cool
Snatching niggas out they shoes then wear their jackets to school
Fuck boy you caught up in my dream
Countin' cream on the cover of a magazine
I'm the Source, got the plug with the uncut
Jay-Z blue magic nigga, what! what!
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high
Triple beam dreamin' as the cream multiplies
Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
‘Fore you sell dope there's shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions, duct tape
Fornicating, counting money with a fuck face
Fucking bitches that be giving up your whereabouts
Slow leaks, gotta air ‘em out
Kill ‘em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga ball
Phantom drop head shit, I had to get ‘em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on my plate, fuck 'em all like a
Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality
I'm from where ya hustle determines ya salary
6 figure family member, nigga forget about it
Low income housing, nigga try to get up out it
I got a plan nigga just believe in me
Triple beam dreaming with this thing me

Pocketful of money, parking lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens they got cameras every angle

Rick Ross,"Rose huh, that’s the problem with these rap niggas
They don’t know how to play it cool you know
Mean it’s a time and place for everything
Been thinking bout you all day
Right now, is about that time
Look how you turn me on baby (They like when you talk to em)
(If you saying something)
Seeing is believing (Ursher baby) turn the lights on

She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip (Huh)
In the gallery all I get is buy me this
Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn
Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan
Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money
Balenciaga sneakers, now she touching cash money
So sexy in them all black Giuseppe heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top off the Ferrari now we thugged out
Smoking on that Cali' bumping 2Pac
It’s me against the world now what’s your phone number?
Jumping in that range rover and I’m coming over

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
I’m day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
'Cause nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
And every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, yeah

I think I wanna put a ring on it
I think I wanna tat her name on me (tat tat tatted up)
I had a lot of sexy women, but this is not the same for me
Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce!
Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced
I love it when she speak a different language
I touch her in so many different angles
Born stunna and my baby so stunnin'
Niggas want her, but she find them so funny
I’m getting money, living like the most wanted
She all I ever needed, now Usher sing it

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
Day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
Nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
Let me and every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, touch

Pink champagne for my dime piece
In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece
In the streets you know I’m eating like a lion feast
Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things
Keys to the crib, keep it trill, time to handle biz'
Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest nigga
Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche
Killing all haters, showing no remorse
Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice
I’m not them other boys, she know I shine the most
She modeling a lot I know she on the go
Another bottle of Ciroc, baby let’s have a toast

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
I'm dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
'Cause nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
Every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, touch",Touch'N You

Francis Ford, fuckin' with them hoes
You niggas still can't afford

Made so many mistakes I know that my niggas relate
Just to rattle my cage, so much shit they sat on my plate
She know me through records, but she don't know me too well
All this game is for sale was priceless, I keep for myself
Shots fired, man expired in his Jordan 3's
Small talk, turn that page, that's all they ever read
You graduated, you still unemployed
Taken for granted, love is null and void
No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes
Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues
Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni
Your paper chasin', can't see that it's runnin' from you
My homies from the block, they labeled me cunnin'
No excuse for my success, so they say I'm Masonic
I keep it one hundred, fuck her, I keep the car runnin'
How she fuck on the back, that's to keep food on the stomach

Look at me, look at me
Realest shit you niggas ever seen
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me

Playin' for keeps, and that's just to say at the least
Had a few seizures, nigga refused to get me some sleep
I let shit slide, I should see the sparks
Now I think about my moms when I jot these songs
I think of certain niggas when I mention guns
Heavy artillery, death to enemies number one
Francis Ford, flows you niggas can't ignore
Shoppin' with them hoes you niggas can't afford
Bellaire Rose, they thought I'd go gold, wouldn't sell anything more
They thought I'd fail, they thought I'd fold
Go to hell, any nigga wanna buy my soul
Double-M, extend my hand, I see you stumblin'
Francis Ford films budget, double-forty M's
Godfather money, filmin' part four again
Butterball, Magic City, so you know it's him, me

Fuck a net worth when I'm just trynna maintain
Tennessee, I felt like Mr. Wendal, nigga
When ain't nobody starin' out that window with you
Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated
Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas
It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture
Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figures
Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I
Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial
But I see the gems, I see the stars
Diabetes and all, your name will carry on

To love me baby is too easy
But what I need you to do is just believe me

Bel-Air running down the Rollie on her arm
Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it
I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield
Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib
25 mil, I'm doing 25-to-life
100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night
Every chandelier rented nigga one mil'
20 chandelier's motherfucker who real
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Birkin now she in the Bentley
That's when she went and tatted double M G
Now I ballin' deep, deeper than the rap
She give me brain she a mastermind to be exact
She a mastermind to be exact
I give her game and she give it back
Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind 'till your eyes close, stay strapped till the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dogs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off, what make it worse he get an elbows
25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone

It makes me smile, it makes me smile
'Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can't nobody stop me

Rick Ross,"My corner so polluted, young niggas looting
I studied Kenneth Williams, I'm one hell of a student
Remarkable hustle, my niggas coming home
I kept the candle lit, my nigga never rowed
Niggas caught him slipping, gave him a shit bag
Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack
It's death row, conspiracy theories
Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury
Get some money now, you hated by your own kind
The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline
GABOS, game ain’t based on sympathy
So he put a hit on his cousin at 18
A sweet potato pie, oh me, oh my
Showing no remorse watching the others cry
Heroin sales, detectives'll sell
A lot of yellow tape, where that Obama care?
This the mob, bitch, silk underwear
Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams
Niggas hating, though they studied my moves
I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews
Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues
Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue
I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith
I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face
Bill Belichick, coaching and calling the shots
Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops
Then we celebrate, black bottles pop
Time to elevate, we re-open shop
Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar
My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage
Petite felite, platinum Audemars
Ain't no tags needed, nigga, I own them cars
I know them bitches, we met them broads
Never loved one, fucked them all
I'm a fucking dog, Ricky fucking Ross
Nigga Birkin bags just for my runner-ups
But my main bitch she get the main dish
Not the old range, that was a lame bitch
Brazilian weave, she say I came quick
I let her see a hundred ki's, a different St. Nick
Moving bricks like it's Black Friday
She gotta fuck me or call me a fat crybaby
Looking over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul
Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my ho
Glock .40, even when I shower
Chrome .22 in my swimming towel
Mob ties and I pray the music set me free
May the powers that be, nigga let me be

We around when the sun goes down
And the real, real killers they mourn for ya
It's gonna be a bloodshed
One month, one day it's gonna be a bloodshed
Bop, gunshot in the head
Payback is a motherfucker
Yes, I feel it when I squeeze the trigger
I feel the air when my enemies die
I feel the strength of ten killas
What is to be, will be
Only God on earth can kill me

You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark
Where it's lonely
You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain
Of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

Mama's tryna save me
But she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me
Man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

""Blast for me"" the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers moving out of rentals, art of war is mental
Having sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feeling like it's voodoo
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed to Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

Mama's tryna save me

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas?
What the fuck is their culture?
Where the fuck is their souls at?
What defines you?
These niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces
You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga!
Make up your got damn mind!

I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothing penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and taking their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine until it's even keel
Like I'm knowing every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

Mama's tryna save me
But she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me
Man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

Fuck you wanna talk about?
Fuckin' jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's
And fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls

If you cut it, call it Jam Master Jay
No Adidas but I rock a brick a day
Talk about the jewels outta nigga reach
Nigga please, so I came back with a bigger piece
You still smokin' weed on your car chase
I'm pullin' off the car lot screaming: ""God’s great!""
Before the crib you gotta clear the guard's gate
Elevators like Frank's on Scarface
New Presidential had that pauvre
Like a G, I gave the Cartier to Wale
Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover
Told Warner Brothers that the game's over

For me to move forward from here on I need 50
I ain't talking 50 Cent neither nigga, haha

I came back a rich nigga
Young mogul, Bo Jackson, I'm a switch hitter
They want me face down on the pavement
Gang members claiming I need to make a payment
It's hard for a young black executive
Can't you see we're all fucking relatives
Relatively easy we can go to war
Fuck it, we can go to war
Chasing me a hundred million, that's inshallah
Fresh up out the Feds system, welcome home Jabar

All my shit went gold, nigga

I remember smoking mid grade
Till I went and got my shit straight
I'm spittin' like this bitch a mixtape
Till they seen a Ghost with a temp plate
Sitting in the trap blowing thick smoke
Traffic in my dope, with a thick ho
Feds tore apart the squad, nigga
That's why I had to play my part, nigga
That wasn't me, it was a job, nigga
It gets deeper, that was just a start, nigga
Screaming in my sleep, I know Lord hear me

Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I went childish

When we fucked again, she said ""That was just some foul shit""

False floors for firearms is how you should ride
Tried to murder me while in mine so that's how I survived
My new deal with Def Jam just set me for life
Want to chapel the BM, man, I'm just rolling the dice
Big numbers, I'm John Wall, I'm balling tonight

Panamera with Tony Dribble, BK's full of paper
Made a killing on Martin Luther James every shooter

Caught them slipping, gave them a pass throwing pistols at surviving gang

Trapping little Davis, bitch, just take me to the cakebook

Clean Maybach, but it's filthy as shit
They partitioning for the women, how busy we get
From the scotch, the large mop, bet the linking feel
It's all a dream and never wake me up until it's real
Duffle bags, that's for the homie when he coming home
He never told and he never used the telephone
He on swole and that nigga need a telephone
In a Range Rover and a real nigga got it for him

You wanna know how does it feel
I know, I bet it feel so real
Tell me it's real, I wanna know
How does it feel, to be supreme

Catch a nigga slipping, put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm living like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothing but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop running
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunning
Down the innocent, and then the beginning ends
You was doing 50 in the 35, the ending is
You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'
Damn, a blessin in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last key
Could it be that maybe God is intervenes
With my life like he did so many times in between
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now it was back then, nothing stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yelling
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas getting caught go and tell it

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

Can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the ages
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys, Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

I need that, I need that, I need that bad",Blessing in Disguise

Where the palm trees and the bright lights look so pretty
Don't lose your soul chasing that pot of gold

I'm trying to go where I can't go
Trying to be what I can't be
I wanna teach you what I can't show
We gotta reach what we can't reach
Trying to shine when the sun won't
I gotta grind as I gun tote
She's rolling weed as I'm doing me
I count the cheese, she can count on me
Wonderful times, lay a head for a young nigga
Like the day she told her that I was a drug dealer
That explains how the cars came

I roll dice with the low-lifes

Peach Ciroc and the L's long
Get to meet Barack rub elbows
We the ones that never got the pale grants
Fuck Full Sale let your mail stack
I just wanna sign another lease
Mentality of young niggas in the streets
But I think it's time they buy they own
And if you got it give your man a loan
And if you bought it we can leave it 'lone
My niggas 'bout it all their teeth are gone
All gold grills, but to each his own
Got in power to put my people on (Get your money right)

Children havin' children, but they don't have a plan
All this drug dealing, it's killing our brother man
The government feed 'em freedom, but they don't understand

Rick Ross,"Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
'Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now

Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
'Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his beamer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And Paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come

So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, ""you ain't learn from your brother nigga?""","Tony Story, Pt. 2"

Fuck where you from cuz all we deal with is color money

Miami niggas got them changing all the gun laws
So run Forrest got some shooters and they dying too
I got more money than that pussy that you’re signed to
Survive who call this a color money conversation
A hundred stacks will cover everything I’m contemplating
Full confrontation home invasion for the quarter key
Them cheap ass condos ain't the safest place you want to be
Call up my C.O. but you better not go call police
So when I see you I’ma give you what you wanna see
You wanna see?

Color money

Rob a nigga close to me you better bring it back
Until the day we even steven tell you bring it back
Red rubies on they can't believe a nigga rap
Color money still feed niggas in the trap
They got the Rolie with the red face
The red ring nigga looking like a fair case
Fuck all these rappers real talk cuz I ain't fucking with em
Double M we balling way harder than Puff and em
It ain't no love loss I only see one boss
You looking at him when they got the guns going off
And all the bitches on the staff and they get a check
So bust it open never test a nigga intellect

Very place I first seen my first triple beam
Dirty game, pillow talkin' witcha mayne
Giver her dope dick and all the things that she would say

Irritated, uneducated still scribble my flows
The jubilation, the euphoria
Pushing a foreign in the morning
Pick your daughter up
Drop your seed off, let the weed up
Slow motion, fast forward 'til we speed up
Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth
Get away from me, you looking so suspicious
Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas
Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes
Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes
You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on the shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man getting life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the ninth never pierced her ears
Time will come when all that nice shit disappears
Why you think I'm on the night shift with the pills?

So many false allegations, is my image tainted
3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous
As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted
All I wanted was some Bel Air and a Danish
Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it 'cause I'm rich and I know what pain is? 
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music do you know what rhythm is? 
Stick your head in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight clear my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash the beef, or kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man will kill a bitch

So if I die before I wake, say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect
Never said that I deserved it
Never said I wouldn't lie
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry
But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright

Whitey Bulge' your horse, soldier leaving Vietnam
Pledge allegiance to the flag

Flew a hundred niggas to Veil on a ski trip
Put away the dope we can see the slopes
We built this shit together why it mean the most
Head on collision somehow I walk away
Give you music for free recouping with the yay
You're rocking with the bow-tie Don
In God we trust, I bust and post bond

Learning lessons on my transgressions
Accept in the street, niggas we live by different rules

Waps in the marble, only y'all down to sing sing
Tellin' jokes, blowin' smoke, the finest artichokes
Fine dishes, pretty bitches on our gold spokes
I'm tipping through on my shorty, eyes look Tiffany blue
Methodous flows killing these niggas, Christians approved
Very wild, no photos, these niggas rarely smile
Only problem is staying low while the paper pile
Scared to come to town, really?
How you niggas sound
I get my bitch to come pick you up, just to gun you down

You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody

Fame is a flaw, I give the game to you raw
Number one in the south, she can see that from afar
She can tell by the car, double R on the plate
Rolls Royce over those Black Market bumping in the Wraith
Rich nigga with poor taste, starve while y'all ate
I put my niggas on, they got 20 more on the way
We all gotta die so that's double M to the day
I know the devil try so I get on my knees and pray
Jesus still walks, we marchin' in a parade
Black and white holding hands
While letting that thing blaze
Pistol on my waist, I can feel a police chase
Homie cutting crack like home made cheese cake
I get right, I get it right, I double back, I get it right
We make mistakes, but baby now is the time to get it right
I see you on IG, but really what you living like

You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody

My heart nickle plated, these haters they all hating
Hate to see me smile, hate to know that I made it
Hate to see me toast with my niggas, I'm motivated
Hate to see me with these women at these publications
I still get it poppin', let me get them keys
I still do the proper, do the BET's
I still roll it proper, let my niggas feast
Still in that 'Rarri blowing hella p's

I'm doing big things, I got big dreams
Move out of my way, if you ain't for me
Feel like a winner, I put in work
So many years, man I deserve to be celebrated on every level
If you can't take it, that's your problem
I'm gonna thrive, I'm gonna shine
I'm gonna live my life

You only get one life

Is it jealousy or am I cursed by the gods
My son's mother don't know when or where to start
All the years that I known her, trick never had a job
Unemployed that'll get a bitch depressed
But unlike them other, boys she watched me kill 'em with finesse
I took a turn pussy boy, pick up a book and learn
Have your ass in a church before I end the verse
Rims on the whip got it looking hypnotic
Stuffing money in my pockets as you niggas watching
Crocodile python, all my ice on

She so ecstatic when I fuck her with the lights on

They want the deeds to my fruit of labor

Devil wanna deal a nigga death or debt
They want to own every thing I own
They sends drones to survey my home
Suits designed to protect my wealth
Bloody Glock 40 to protect myself

Cubans on my neck looking like a python
On the couches I'm the one they got their eyes on
Skip your name, now they want to know your tax bracket
Tell 'em that you with me and the pussy's automatic
I paid dues in these streets
I gave so much I got nothing to lose in these streets
Family asked me am I in Illuminati
Beat twenty cases like John Gotti
White man fear a nigga with a free mind
And if you disagree tell him that he can free mine
Took my Rolex and gave me an ankle monitor
So many angles these haters'll start popping up
Renounced my citizenship and moved to Singapore
Couple tax breaks all accounts offshore

She fell in love with the flow, such a beautiful stroke
Fascinated allegation kilo grams of that coke
Roll with 25 and never knew his social number
Mac-11 for that Gucci belt to go up under
Black man's pride, see it in my eyes
Fayette county prosecutor want to take a nigga house
So much disdain for the police
Clan rally niggas swang from them oak trees
Wood wheel in the Wraith on the skinny tires
Crocodile python seats on the carbon fiber
Hot boy, stash box in the gas tank

Went to the line and got ‘em bitches on the same day
Straight to the jeweler, and did the watches the same way
Young sav on face time, talking cake time
Next crib I build got to cross state lines

In a room full of failures I feel out of place
Still sleeping on the floor when you deserve better

Somebody take me to the bank 'cause it open at ten

Poverty stricken, boy you gotta be kidding
Living like we hit the lottery nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident
All these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stoping it
Get off my dick nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that, real nigga roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talking to the law, knowing that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Bennie Boom
Started out with nothing, now a nigga in a room
Sweeping rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers nigga, I could never lose

I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
Oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors

I seen this years ago
Picasso on the wall

Like Lamborghini doors

Paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You banging on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm stepping through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rolling a wood leaf
Phone ringing, smiling like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick in NBC out on the NorthEast
Such a feeling, niggas killing for my poetry
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your wedding vows
I still be making rounds like I'm Kevin Liles
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me stepping out

Started off poor with plans to own more
To riding under stars, the life we lived for
Dreaming of things we can't afford
But now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now
I bet they say, ""He put his niggas on""
Now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh",Lamborghini Doors

So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my Magnum Opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps, now we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my piña colada
Put my coattail on my dog; I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire, just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy
If it's the Lord's will, so be it, that boy been a 'G'

Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both went in, that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started sendin' tracks
Once was a dependent on her income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it may be off a couple racks

Went to war, beaker scores, they continue to fall
Corner stores, way to uphold all these wonderful laws
So much violence in the streets, ask the powers that be
Kiss my daughter on the cheek and I'm strapped as we speak
Dirty money get bloody, you still see the gun wounds
But what's funny are the ones that we put the guns to
Fuck 'em all, kill or be killed, it's still a thug rule
Back of class, high on grass, 'til I said ""fuck school!""
What's meant to be is meant to be, I rather you than me
Die with pride, forty shells on the murder scene

The lack of didn't tap my confidence
Matter fact that's how I mastered a couple things
Went from not having, to sheer opulence
Maybach with the drapes like an apartment in it
Whole hood know it, only one that's white on white
Name ringing like DJ Clue on a Friday night
Just got some real estate out in Dubai
Nation of Islam, they say I may have a few ties
Talking tall brothers with the dark shades
Shed light, bringing niggas out the dark age
Sitting in the court with a sharp fade
Having sentimental thoughts about this Caucasian
Six million in the hole, still feeling short-changed
Reprimanded by someone who's snorting cocaine
Frank Hampton was an angel, may his name ring
Crackers wanna kill me for the same thing
Ain't no financial aid out in Notre Dame
Activist sipping Actavis, tryna pour away

Son of Sam, young with the blam

Pan of our watches, conquer the nonsense, conquering lion

Room full of cloaks and they count votes
Million man march and I'm taking notes

To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

Into a chamber reserved for the Queen

Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried

And this is what she told the gathered round

Take all the red paint take all the white

Walking out quite late one night 
Not feeling happy or feeling down 
In the dark I stumbled over something on the ground 

As I got to my feet 
I heard a strange voice singing low 
Shout out a song I won't forget 
Until my dying day I know 

She said 
Sha, la, la 
Sha, la, la

When I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

First my impulse was to run 
But then the magic caught my ear 
An unforgettable refrain 
A song for all the year 
 
 Sha, la, la

Well then I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

In despair I cried out loudly 
Begging for her to come out 
Suddenly has it began 
The sha la song died out 

At last I realized who had sung it 
Quite amazed I turned to see 
The tall trees waving me goodbye 
The sha la song and me 
They sought me

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where the wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Inside a window
Wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Father Mackenzie writing the words to a sermon no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks
In the dark because nobody's there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
No body came

Father Mackenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
Has he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Where do they all come from

Where do they all belong

The freak they call Jacko the dog face man

And my eyes are running 
And my legs are aching 
And there are people winning 
And the carnivals spinning 

Merry go round 
Go round 
And they make me dizzy 
People shouting as they shot and win 

And my head is ringing 
My ears are flitting 
And my hair is thinning 
And the carnivals spinning 
 
After the people have gone 
I walk along down sideshow ally 
And from the tent I hear some crying 
The sound of someone in pain 

And written brightly on the canvas and woodwork 
So that everybody could see 
Was the question they pose to the public 
When is a man not a man 
When he's a freak in the sideshow 

But we all got to cry 
Yes, we all got to cry 
And we all got to cry

To the organ grinders music

I shook my head and said I really should be gone

And walked out in the heat beneath the summer sun

He looked most upset as he said ""Where've you been?""

Do you think she'd have been shocked
The way that she talked you'd think I was a daughter

Oh take me back with you 1939,
'cause black and white movies
are making me cry.
And born out of time, we slipped hopelessly by.

[Chorus:]
Sophia Loren, Bridgett Bardot, Jean Harlowe,
Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Deitrich.
But Greta, you're better than any I've seen.
Yes, you were a real beauty queen.

Oh listen people, has it happened to you yet?
The feeling that someone was born out of time?
Will you love someone, physically much too young for you?
Either way, it's a shame, time was so cruel.
But it's nice that that, generally, isn't the rule.

[Chorus]
And Clark Gable's who I should have been.",Born Out of Time

How can I feel that way
With those strange men on your arm
Cause I do remember when your head was clear
And you didn't read those looks

Rick Springfield,"I was driving 'round, as the sun went down
When I came upon a lake, the sign said ""Misty Water""
And standing there, with wet and tangled hair was a girl
she said her name was ""Bo"", she was a farmer's daughter
I said get in, I'll take you home, you must be cold
Misty water woman
You never get to her
Misty water woman
You never get to touch her
And feel her near
It began to storm, and our talk grew warm
Till I stopped the car outside a cold and lonely place
I said we're here
But she had disappeared
And on the seat was a pool of tears
And a handkerchief of lace
I did not see her leave
I was amazed
Misty water woman
You never get to her
Misty water woman
You never get to touch her
And feel her warm
I sped into the house,
It took her father and her mother to straighten me out
What was it all about
Please let me know
She looked sad, and he looked mad
And he said, yes you're right, once we had a daughter
Her name was Bo, but that was long ago
Years have gone since she drowned at ""Misty Water""
And the way he took it, took me by surprise
Misty water woman
You never get to her

You never get to touch her
And feel her near",Misty Water Woman
Rick Springfield,"Hands old and poor, her back bent and sore,
She lifts from the drawer,
The photograph.
Though tattered and torn, through years it has worn,
But still bears the form of the man she knew.

Her eyes are weak, spilling tears on her cheek.
Her lips start to speak to the photograph.
She tells him with pride, she still loves him inside.
Though years ago died, la da da da...

And all of the people she knew,
Those who don't know the score say,
We wonder why, she never married,
Such a pretty girl she was, such a lovely face she had,
Such a pretty thing she was...

She turns to her right, to put out the light,
And wishes goodnight to
The photograph.

And goes on and on
She's still alone.",The Photograph

Rick Springfield,"Well, who'd have believed this seasoned connoisseur lady-killer
like me
Would get hurt by a girl like you?
And they got names for dirty little girls like you, honey
It ain't nice, but they call you ""everybody's girl""

And they say: ""Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes""
And they say: "" here she comes, here she comes, here she comes
There goes everybody's girl
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl, everybody's girl""

You might say I was blind for a while
I fell asleep at the driving wheel
You sure woke me up in a hurry, honey
And I can't blame anyone but me I know
It's my fault for falling for everybody's girl

And they say: ""He's the one, he's the one, he's the one""
And they say: ""He's the one, he's the one, he's the one

You're cut deep with self-destructivity
Your mind's made up, you're heading for the day
When you'll shake and your heart breaks
It's gonna come

Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checkin' out the left hand
That we didn't see the right
And tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go

I hurt you now you're moving out again
But we know just what you'll do
We'll see the error of our ways in crime
With conciliatory promises we'll change this time

I love you, I love you, I love you
But I can't stop hurting you
I want to, I want to
I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you, it's getting bad

I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you
It's getting bad, I don't know what to do

And when you go I miss you all night
The wounds heal from the scratch and bite
I don't know what's wrong
I don't know what's right
But I can't stop hurting you
I can't stop hurting you

We talk so coolly about the pros and cons
When I get hot headed I just can't hold on

I love you, I love you, I love you
I can't stop hurting you

Rick Springfield,"He was raised in the English way
His daddy taught him respect, he taught him how to pray
They sent him off to boarding school
Where he learned how to live by someone else's rule

And he went to confession
He went to confession
Holy Father, wash my sins away
He went to confession
He went to confession
Mother Mary, take the pain away

He read letters from home at night in his bed
And got this uneasy feeling when his father said:

Fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy
The fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy

He bought his daddy's car, and he learned to drive
And when he left school, he got a nine-to-five
He met the girl, and he got his spouse
And they had the child, and they got the house

And he went to confession
He went to confession
Holy Father, wash my sins away
He went to confession
He went to confession
Mother Mary, take the pain away

He loved his son, and he helped him build walls and fronts
He knew he'd heard it before
Someone had said it once:

Fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy
The fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy

He raised his son in the English way
And he taught him respect, he taught him how to pray
He sent him off to boarding school
Where he learned how to live by someone else's rules

And he went to confession
He went to confession
Holy Father, wash my sins away
He went to confession
He went to confession
Mother Mary, take the pain away

It must be something much deeper than fear or pain
Another child learns a pattern, he won't break the chain

Fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy
The fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy","Like Father, Like Son"
Rick Springfield,"Ever since I was a kid
I remember having dreams of grandeur
I was gonna be someone, I know what I want

Everybody played second best
And I held you back just like all the rest
I think I got what I want

Everybody's got to fight their demons
And you know I had to fight mine, too
It took a lot out of me, it took a lot out of you

To be living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shock you, too

All the money that I spend on you
Doesn't mean a thing if the love's not true
Baby please, I'll get what you want

Can't you tell me you and me ain't lost
I know what I did, I know what it cost
Now I'm yours and I've got what you want

All the fightin' will have been for nothin'
If at the end I can't have you
I'll throw it all away if that's what you want me to do

Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shake you, too

Funny how desire can burn you up inside
And make you commit emotional suicide
Everybody's got the desire to leave their mark
Some just do it over a trail of broken hearts

And all the people that protect and serve
would disappear if the well dried up
I'm thirsty for affection
Let me drink from your loving cup

Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shock you
Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can rock you
Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shake you
Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you, too

Rick Springfield,"Lookin' back I'd say we broke a few rules
Left one or two hearts in a ruin
Spent all that precious time doin'
Things we figured that Presley might have done

Stole a few cars, never got caught
Started some fights in the scrimmage
We got caught up in the image
Of playing young rebels by the handbook

Looking back I guess we had some attitude
We were gonna be hard and tough

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna shine

Look in the mirror watch our faces change
We were gonna be McCartney clones
We skipped school to see the Rolling Stones
And sang their songs on the train on our way home

We were gonna be like all of them
Uncompromising to the very end
Live for girls, guitars and glory
And someday they'd write our story

Sometimes I think that they clapped in sympathy
But we were gonna be hard and tough

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place
In the sun

Johnny's still living, back in Australia
I hear he's got himself a wife and kids
And I'm still chasing whatever it is
That put me out here on the road in the first place

I think of the times, I cursed out loud
Wishin' I was still runnin' with the same old crowd
Sometimes it can make you cry
Just watching the years roll by

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place

Rick Springfield,"Her come-on was direct and strong
From her question to her kiss
She said she'd had a little much to drink
She didn't usually do this
But she was looking for another head to scalp tonight
And she had me right between her sights

I turned to face her as the jukebox clicked off
Playing a favorite song
And she looked pretty in the low lit bar
But something was wrong
I saw a dull red neon sign flashing in her eyes
It said "" VACANCY,"" she had motel eyes

[Chorus:]
They were black as the night
And shone like a star
Fueled by the light
From a medicine jar
I looked again but there was nothing there
But ice in her eyes
There's no disguising motel eyes

She had the angles all down pat
Her average must be high
And though it could have been a pleasure
I just had to say goodbye
Though there was something wicked
About the way she flexed her thighs
She scared me with her motel eyes

[Chorus]

She started saying something
Bout moving versus size
The sign kept on flashing in her motel eyes

[Chorus]

Black as the night
Black as the night, motel eyes

Rick Springfield,"It all started here, she was a girl from the mid-west
He was a stranger in a strange land
Same old story
He came for the glory 
She came looking for a young man's hand

But they found bright lights
And endless nights
And men just used her innocent ways
He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city
They lost sight of the reasion
They lost count of the days

And they were two souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

Two souls searching for heaven
Rolling the dice looking for a seven
To the tick, tick, ticking of time
Gotta beat the clock

Too many nights on the ledge
He acquired a knife edge
Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands
Some nights she cried for pity in the heart of the city
The city smacked her hands

He met her one endless night
Her eyes had a light
There was something familiar about the smell of her
Skin
He held her tighter and tighter 
As he danced inside her
She knew from the moment that she let him in

They'd been two souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven
To the tick, tick, ticking of time
Gotta beat the clock
Beat the clock
Beat the clock
Beat the clock

Two souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

And they're taking me no where
And sometimes it's hard
Just to find what you need

But lately I'm feeling
Something good's come around
Cause she just takes me way up
And she won't let me down

And beautiful feelings are starting again
And all of my heartaches are starting to mend
And beautiful feelings are there till the end
So I open them up and I let them in

Well I needed to feel
That I'm destined for something
And I need to get down on my knees
More and pray
And I need to feel a warm body near mine
When I wake in the morning
Suddenly to find

That beautiful feelings are starting again
And all of my heartaches are starting to mend
And beautiful feelings are there till the end
So I open them up and I let them in

I get feeling guilty
From climbing too high

You gotta make it right for me
It seems this other man's name has been following me around
And it just won't let me be
You see I got this name and he's got this name too
And you know they're kinda close only a blind crazy fool
Would think I was him it's like saying green is blue
But let me tell you brother it started being a bother
When he made the cover of Time magazine

I was at this party in the well-heeled hills
Just the other night
Her name was Shelly I introduced myself
She just smiled and said ""all right""
Well we got talkin' and drinkin' wine
And she said she liked my music thought it was fine
She said, ""Let's make love, your place or mine,""
And in the middle of the passion I was on the borderline
When she called out a name but it wasn't mine

She called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce

My name is Rick I'm gonna stick it to ya babe

And there's this kid walking carrying a guitar
You know I told him that I played
He asked me my name you know I told him
I said it plain as clear as day
Well he seemed really, clearly, sincerely impressed
And as he pulled a piece of paper for me to sign from his vest
He said, ""I thought Born To Run was one of your best.""
Aww wait a minute man, who do you think I am?
He answered, ""Mr. Springsteen, your a famous man.""

Rick Springfield,"He just turned seventeen
When the moment came
He was standing on the corner
In the pouring rain

She pulled up along side
And rolled the window down
And said, ?Can I drive you
To some part of town??

he's sitting beside here
With a great big smile
The lady had class
And she stood out a mile

His heart was a beating
Like a big bass drum
Thinking at last
His time had finally come

He started Tallinn? fast
Trying to loosen up
But he felt kind a stupid
So he shut up

She said, ?don't think I'm fast
?Cause I'm really not?
But his fever went all wild
It was getting hot

She pulled into the driveway
Of a big brown stone
He was champing at the bit
And then her heart be told

She said, ?My husband?s working
He?ll be gong all day?
But he couldn't believe it
When he heard himself say

I'm getting cold feet
I'm getting cold feet

Lady, doncha hear me talking to you
Hey there's something that you can do
I'm so nervous I just might shoot you
I've got them cold, cold feet

Well, a couple years on
And our hero?s grown
He's a professional musician
With a band of his own

hadn't had much luck
With the girls that he meets
Might get another case of cold feet

He met a girl not too long ago
She thought she could change him but it wasn't so
As soon as she mentioned long term romance
He went into that same old song and dance

I'm getting cold feet
See-see-cold feet

I'm getting cold feet , see-see-cold feet

No there ain't something you can do

I've got cold, cold, cold, cold
Upset about it
Cold, cold, cold, cold

Go without, um
Cold, cold, cold, cold
Said I've got them cold, cold feet

He increased his quota
Of one night stands
It was a kind of complex
You understand

He would treat ?em real mean
He was low down and dirty
Now he's got to make some changes
'Cause he's nearly thirty

'Cause he had a dream, just the other night
He was standing in God?s ever-present light
And God said I?d like to let your life run it?s coarse
But you'd understand me having second thoughts

I'm getting cold feet

I'm getting cold feet

Listen doncha here me talking to you
I think you know what you have to do
You gotta make some changes

And she's on her knees, fallin' on her knees
Askin' how the world can be so cold to her
And she listens to the records, playin' on the radio
And she's fallin' in love with a singer

Now she's feelin' better and she's feelin' good
But she's coming down by the time the song is over
And she starts feelin' lonely
Feelin' she's the only ordinary solitary one
All alone the solitary one

Oh, hurryin' home, oh God, it's been one of those bad days
But with a flick of a switch and a twist of the dial
She gets love on the airwaves
And they send her favorite lovers to keep her satisfied

Busy blowing to the priests of noise.
Turn it up and make it drown out the warning
Bad news for the girls and boys.
Everybody looks so romantic
Acting like it's nothing at all.
Looking out for number one
Working for the week and living to the beat.
Dance this world away - dance this world away -
Dance this world away - dance this world away.
I see people all dressed like Nero
Fiddling while Rome burns in strife.
Personal responsibility zero
We've lost that rhythm of life.
There's a shadow in our bright horizon
It won't be manna falling out of the sky.
The hard rain hits everyone
Working for the week and living to the beat.
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Somewhere there is a ship that's sinking
Why do I think that nobody knows?
Looking out for number one
Working through the week and dancing to the back beat.

Rick Springfield,"Now I can tell you how I feel
A broken heart is this for real
There's still so much for me to do
And to know
And to be and to feel

If you think you're groovy
You don't even move me
There's no denying
If you dare to be true

In my dreams I dreamt for two
My dreams were real but where were you
And now my dreams have all been changed
Rearranged
There's room for two
But not for you

If you think you're groovy
You don't even move me
There's no denying

Oh you made me feel so real
Baby how I used to feel
Now I know what it's all about
Honey I found out (I found out) I found out

(That you're numb inside,
That the feelings all have died)
You're praying and you're saying

Nothing goes away that won't come back

She sleeps under a rainbow
She won't dream in colour
She thinks that her soul is painted
Grey or black or white
Sleeping under a rainbow

Glass mirror, look in (I know it's hard to see,
When the one you free is you)
Sleep walking, high talking (but the colours
Aren't real and the things you feel don't last)
You sit there looking at the sunrise
Not knowing if the day has come or gone
Wondering why it turns you off
When it never turns you on

Picking at the lock on the front door
Pulling at the shutters on the windows
But you're living in a house of shadows

Even though you're lonely you think it's you
Sitting at that table set for one
You're waiting for the guest that never comes

Rick Springfield,"Someone along the way derailed your train
And I'm having a real hard time
Getting any love through your defenses
You listen to your heat but I know how well
You listen to your heart
If this is the real thing
Then I want more from you than flesh and blood

So, Soul To Soul
I know how it feels
Between lover to lover (we're gonna be)
So, Soul To Soul
Like a magnet to steel
Just like lover to lover (we're gonna be)

We don't make love so much
Have a bedroom crucifixion
Any love that you receive only seems to go skin deep
You lost the key, don't throw away the house
Tho' I love your flesh and blood
This is the real thing
And I want more from you than skin to skin

So, Soul To Soul
I know how it feels
Between lover to lover (we're gonna be)
So, Soul To Soul
Like a magnet to steel
Just like lover to lover (we're gonna be)

Somewhere there's an altar she lays herself across it
And she hands me the blade but I don't, I don't stick it in

So, Soul To Soul and the faithful all kneel
Every sister and brother (we're gonna be)
So, Soul To Soul and I wish it was real
Just like lover to lover (we're gonna be)

And if this ain't what you want
You better tell me now baby
Cause I want more from you than skin to skin

So, Soul To Soul
I know how it feels
Between lover to lover (we're gonna be)
So, Soul To Soul
Like a magnet to steel
Just like lover to lover (we're gonna be)

Somewhere there's an alter she lays herself across it
And she hands me the blade but I can't, I won't stick it in

So, Soul To Soul and the faithful will kneel
Every sister and brother (we're gonna be)
So, Soul To Soul and I wish it was real
Just like lover to lover (we're gonna be)

Mercury rising into the red
The smell of your skin can light up all the fires in me

Hungry to touch, I'm eager to please
Out of control and I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning to make love to you

But don't try to tell me you think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

When we make love, it's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake, sink you teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made to be played by my
hands

And you got the power, it amazes me still
How you play my emotions with consummate skill
I don't have to look any further than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me you think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that

You better know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

Don't try to tell me you think it's all physical

I know you know you've got to go on and live your life
Go down to the river of the spirit that runs through you
And lay yourself down in the healing waters

You know that I believe it comes back to me

There is no absolution whether I'm the garden or the rose
If I ain't part of the solution, yeah you know how that goes
You can always leave but you bring it all back home someday

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea

You know that I believe it comes back to me

Every single thing I say, everyone that I betray
Any love that I take when I do not make it in return
Every thing I do and every time I've been unfaithful too
All the things that I believe are lessons I must learn

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love I give to another
You know that I believe it comes back to me

Rick Springfield,"In my perfect world
There's no need to right the wronged
Laid down my burden 
I know I did not carry the weight
Not sure to who responsibility belonged 
I turned a blind eye
While waiting for the hand of fate to still the waters
Heal all the broken hearts
And hope it could be done without a sacrifice
And maybe I just wouldn't pay the price 
I've fought this long enough
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear: I send the prayer
And now I feel all I can do is not enough
My Rome is burning, and I'm standing at the deep abyss
But every passion started with an act of love 
And every act of love started with a single kiss
Father, father, your gift was my world of light 
And I've betrayed you with a single Judas kiss 
I've been my own executioner 
But it's not just me anymore
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear
Burn my wasted pride
Open your heart to this
There's a voice that's crying somewhere 
Deep inside my soul for shelter
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear

Rick Springfield,"So there I stood, square on my side of the great divide
A message came across a void 
And for the first time in my life
I'm awake, I'm alive
I thought I was immune to this 
Till I felt the static charges in the air
I touch you; you're a live wire
You're the raw fire burning in my heart
And it took me by surprise; that's no lie
You know you are; you are a sharp shock to my system 
A spark, a real shock
You know you are; you are a sharp shock to my system
You start; I can't stop
You taught me how to listen; shock to my system
My soul, my skin; you plug me in 
And all of my pain is gone just like it never was
For the first time in my life, I know what I feel 
Now every time we touch I'm caught off my guard
That's no lie
You know you are; you are a sharp shock to my system 
A spark, a real shock
You know you are; you are a sharp shock to my system
You start; I can't stop
You taught me how to listen; shock to my system

Rick Springfield,"I can see her at her windows watching,
Locked away inside her skin,
I can see her but I can't get to her, she won't come out,
And she won't let me into

The white room (she's living in)
Lying alone til she comes undone
In the white room, she burns for the real thing.
But it won't come.

In her head is the same obsession
And all the bottles and pills won't heal her heart.
She heard his last confession
And every word just tears her apart

In the white room (locked away)
Doing time till her time is done
In the white room there's so much to say
But the words won't come.

Come back to the land of the living,
When you gonna break the chain,
There's so much too much that you're leaving
And you're never gonna stop the rain
In the white room.
Waiting for the call that never comes
In the white room, she awaits.

Look at something long enough you'll find,
That the splinters and the cracks begin to show,
I'll be the first in line when the walls start falling
And she lets go of

The white room (it's late)
Living alone only makes you numb
In the white room she burns for the real thing
But it won't come

In the white room (she's living in) I think its time
That you're time is done,
In the white room she burns
In the white room (it's late)
Lying alone till she comes undone
In the white room she awaits

When the curtain fell and the lights came up
But the gods or whatever make the world go round
Shuffled when they should have cut

Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
To lose you

Did it come too easy to the two of us
Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checking out the left hand
That we didn't see the right

Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I

Oh baby, please, oh baby, please come back
I meant to say in time
Baby we could work it out

Rick Springfield,"It all started here, she was a girl form the midwest 
He was a stranger in a strange land 
Same old story 
He came for the glory 
She came looking for a young man's hand
But they found bright lights 
And endless nights 
And men just used her innocent ways 
He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city 
They lost sight of the reason 
They lost count of the days
And they were two souls searching for each other 
One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock
Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven 
To the tick, tick, ticking of time 
Gotta beat the clock
Too many nights on the ledge 
He acquired a knife-edge 
Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands 
Some nights she cried for pity in the heart of the city 
The city smacked her hands
He met her on endless night 
Her eyes had a light 
There was something familiar about the smell of her skin 
He held her tighter and tighter 
As he danced inside her 
She know from the moment that she let him in
They'd been two souls searching for each other 
One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock
Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven 
To the tick, tick, ticking of time 
Gotta beat the clock 
Beat the clock 
Beat the clock

One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

Rick Springfield,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about loveless fascination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

And it's something quite peculiar
Something that's shimmering and white
Leads you here despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

You're so good, when we make love it's understood 
It's more than a touch or a word can say 
Only in dreams could it be this way

You don’t want to put the hurt on someone
Been trying to convince you something
Better off if you just turn and run

I’m gonna hold on tight, I’ve got a feeling
You’ll only happen once to me
And no one, not even you
Is ever gonna make you wrong for me

Don’t walk away or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan?
Don’t walk away I’ll do everything to make you stay
I’ve got to make a stand
Don’t walk away, I’m not afraid, don’t walk away

I don’t know where you’re going
But I know what you’ve got on your mind
I think your fear is showing
You don’t leave things like fear behind

I hate to be the one to break it to you that
We’re only human after all
I can mend a broken wing
I’ll give you everything I have

Don’t walk away or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan?
Don’t walk away I’ll do everything to make you stay
I’ve got to make a stand
Don’t walk away, I’m not afraid, don’t walk away

You used to be the one who used to be so strong
What happened to your rationale?
Your heart is on the line, it happens all the time

Don’t walk away
Don’t walk away

Don’t walk away or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan?
Don’t walk away I’ll do everything to make you stay

She takes her time and doesn't
Feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him

There will be times when all the things
She said will fill your head

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

I didn't see you guys at all, the whole time she was here
Let's break out the bottle, the party's just begun
We're havin' us a family reunion

Here comes ole mister teardrops
And look there's uncle blues
On and on with sister faded love
In my cup of mornin' blues

Hello sadness, you finally came around
She filled my life with love and I guess you were outta town
Come on in the gangs all here, I can't say it's been fun

But they don't see these memories that haunt me in the dark
Since you went and left me since you broke my heart
Baby I ain't playing with a full deck of cards

The lights are on but there's nobody home
The heartaches are here but the love is all gone
I'm out of my mind I'm no longer in charge
I'm no longer playing with a full deck of cards

I should have seen it coming but it caught me off guard
That joker came and ran off with my queen of hearts
I'm playing solitaire now and the cards are all marked
Tonight I ain't playing with a full deck of cards

Everything about them fits my attitude
No matter where they're going or where they're from

They're purring in my ear, showing me what they've got
I've never wanted anything so much
I've got to have one - I want a girl in a pick-up truck

Power steering, gun rack, spare tire in the back
Goose neck trailer hitch, four-wheel drive
Son-of-a-muddy-ditch wouldn't slow her down
She'd be too tough, man, I want a pick-up truck

I sure am lonesome sittin' all alone
Just waitin' for someone to come and take me home
I guess some guys have all the luck
To have a girl by their side ridin' home in her pick-up truck

Carryin' automobile, I'd put the windows down
Turn the radio up, man, I want a girl in a pick-up truck

Rick Trevino,"When I was young I was frightened by shadow monsters on my walls
I was convinced they would get me in the dark if I slept at all
I knew she was there in her bedroom, so I'd tiptoe down the hall
Lay my head on the floor and try to see under her door

[Chorus]
I was looking for the light
When it was on, I knew everything was all right
Before I could knock she'd open the door,
and I'd look up and see that smile

She always knew when I was looking for the light
At 19 I had all the answers, thought I could make it on my own
As we were packing she said,
""Don't ever forget, this is always your home""

Soon I found a one room apartment
Has monsters of it's own
So sometimes late at night I'd drive by that old house

[Chorus]

I stood there filled with fear, as she was passing away
They said, ""She can't hear you now, all we can do is pray.""
As I squeezed her hand, she opened her eyes
Smiled for me one last time
She always knew

That midnight train bound to take her faraway forever
And I watched the tail light fade away knowing she was gone to stray

Floating upon the river alone

Glittering jewels, shimmering light.

To wear by his side
Each knight took his turn
Brave to the last
Faced with the sword remaining fast.
Arthur called a knight young Galahad
Saw in his sheath no sword he had
Took him where the sword
Held by the stone
Offered him there to make it his own.
Pull me, pull me, pull me, pull me.

Fight and kill the evil man
Rid his evil from our land.

Knowing to save the waste land he must fight
Eager to kill all those who came his way
He must stay
He must fight

A sundial of the time

A self-inflicted crime
To pay with death for pain he gave
To those he soon will meet

The devil at his feet

To our Lord his soul to save

An unlit funeral pyre

You shall not lie in sacred ground
The time has come to meet your maker
Down on earth they heard no sound

Your evil is forever
You shall hang, said the judge

He tried to call out to the maker
On no earthly soil he fell
The maker motioned all around
He felt his soul dragged down to hell
He saw the man that he had murdered
People he had pained on earth
Of souls returning reincarnate
No hope for his rebirth

For your presence on our planes
Is no use for those who wish to rest in peace

Soon the dancing will start
To square old Syd Watter's band
Anticipation is calm, mainly under the arm
As they wait for the dancing to start

Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
There's a plumber from Hackney with a hooker from Bow
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
What once held up high I'm afraid now hangs down low

The costumes are strange just like the people inside
Some men four foot six tall, some women four foot six wide
Still the floor's reinforced for the onslaught to come
As they wait for the dancing to start

Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
Yes they glide round the floor just like hippos in snow
Quick,quick,slow,slow,quick
Here's the Irish contestants, yes it's Doreen and Mick

They each have a number so it's easy to spot
Those who can tango and those who cannot
With their arms in the air and their legs wide apart
They prepare for the dancing to start

Good lord a couple out there are really having a go
He's turned upside down, their bodies now intertwined
What's their number, ay yes, sixty-nine

And Doris there who makes all her own clothes
Unfortunately it's Sydney who's wearing them

Formation teams in a line
Some full of hope and some full of wine
You know the reason why they're there more or less
And their idol's dress

And our solo tenor saxophonist has done for music
What Walt Disney has done for blue movies
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow

Come in number seven, 'cos your time is up
It must please one couple out there on their own

He was a star but now they've all forgot
Now he just lives in the past, he's just a blast from the past

Well he spends every day in salubrious bars
Dreaming that he's still a star
He's got a big enough gut to string a thousand guitars
Wow!

He writes songs all year wich no one wants to hear
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star
He's got no record deal, he's got no modern feel
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

There's more grooves on his face than on his latest LP
Which the music press just shot down in flames
He's musically dead for all the world to see

He grumble he was as big as Jimi Hendrix
Now the only thing that grumbles is his grumbling appendix
Lots of children he's got, well he was on the road a lot
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star
Now the groupies ain't  there...and nor is his hair
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

He cries in his sleep but there is no one to hear
He once used to have the ears of the world
Now there is no one around to care for one single tear
Wow !

Now there is no one around who wants to hear his new sound
That he hoped would shoot him back to fame
Now he's dying inside as well as dying outside
A talent that has turned to shame

Ghost of a rock and roll star

So he's fading away, getting dimmer each day
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

Rock and roll ghost, rock and roll ghost
Ghost of a rock and roll star

So he's leaving my friend, career at its end
He's the ghost of a rock and roll star

Rock and roll ghost, rock and roll ghost
Ghost of a rock and roll star

To the rock and roll heaven afar
So at last without risk, there's a psthumous disc

Sword from this stone
And anvil, is the true-
Born king of all Britain

Upon a New Year's day
A host of knights did pray
That from the anvil one could draw the sword.
As each knight took his turn
They found the anvil, held it firm;
None worthy of a future king and lord.
Sir Kay the bravest knight
Appeared to try his might
He dreamed of being king, as all the rest
To Arthur Sir Kay called to search
And bring for him a sword
In earnest Arthur set about his quest.
A churchyard in the wood
The sword and anvil stood
And Arthur drew the sword out of the stone
The anvil now defeated
His quest for the sword completed
A sword that was to place him on the throne
A sword that was to place him on the throne.
Sir Hector and Sir Kay saw the sword
And knelt to pray
Then gently took it from young Arthur's hand
They marveled at his quest

Carved in stone for a future time
Broken pieces thrown away
Broken pieces that are mine

Hope in words so nearly true
Peaceful times are long unseen
Promises I give to you
Only I know what they mean

Charter for a freedom lost
Made by man who knows not why
Leaving youth to count the cost
They only suffer times gone by

It would never be the same
If ruler lived beyond his past
He would have to live his game
And speed of truth is never fast

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The scream of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

And so
Time moves on
A war
Waged in words
With Kings and Church and common man
But no winner
Or beginner
Can understand the battle plan

But the battle never lasts long
Even though it is an old song
And the singer never sings the same old verse
Turn the melody to war chant
Change the flowers into warplants
Kill them all
Just to swell the purse

Pray to the Father
Peace ever after
Only love
Up above
Glory to the war



So for peace we wage a war
As in war we fight for peace
Death to all, be rich or poor
Comes in such a bloody feast

Will they meet in a future time?
Will it happen yet again?
Only God knows the truth they say
Only He is ahead of our time

Where is the charter made for love?
Where is the charter for killing war?
Sadly hidden in the warrior's glove
Making light for ever more

Magna Charter shows a path
Over which no truth can stray
Floating as a neutral craft along its way

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The screams of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

Rick Wakeman,"Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.
The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise
Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle
Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""
The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving down to the depths in a single motion
Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere

Even though you won't stay

One day you'll come home
Lost without her
All alone

And I'll be waiting right here for you
Ever faithful
Ever true

I should be crying
It's no good crying

I'm really trying
But there's no real hope 
No hope for me

In the air
It's all around me
Everywhere

And our love song is there to sing
Sing the game
The game to win

Fly away my love

Rick Wakeman,"The warmth of your love
Can burn a way into a lost,
Icy cold heart
Change at will
And melt man into man
And turn his head slowly to love
Slowly to love

A Queen for a King
To give the touch of a young
Young woman to sing
Love to the people
But when she's not there
How soon the heart hardens to stone

But what of the man engulfed in love?
But for just brief moments in time
Lost in space with eyes everywhere
My friends
That is the story of love

And if you want to
I can tell you of the pain to follow
And of the innocent
And not the guilty who will suffer
But you won't listen
As the person we are talking to is you

Hey, calm down, main man
No longer are you in control
Bow down to the power of love
A never ending starring role

Queen of hearts
The heart is king
No-one wants to be the clown
A deep breath for the power of love
As the walls come tumbling down

But the man still fights
For the right to be King of England
To lord over all
With a rod of iron and steel
But caught in the trap of love by chance
Nobody gives him a second glance
Not a nice way to get caught
Within the turning wheel
Hear love squeal

Fire coming out
With every single word that's said
With the force of the source that's working
In the secret passage of your head
So sail away
Golden day
So that love can paint the hate clouds red

There's a main frame above
That's the mainstay of our love
(If you ever want to go and find it)
Our love is the right term
For looking for a right turn towards love
(If you ever need to find it)

The man with the arrows is firing at you and me
No good diving
He can fire at land or sea
Attack
Launch
Fire
Fire
Fire your love
Fire your love at the plan
Turn him out
Burn him out
To the passion of a molten fire
Hold on
Release now
I said now, now, now, now, now!


A King for a Queen
A Queen for a King
A song built of love
A love meant to sing

A heart now sold
A heart now won
A heart on fire
A love as one

And if you want to
I can tell you of the pain to follow
And of the innocent
And not the guilty who will suffer
But you won't listen
As the person we are talking to is 
The person living inside you

Sword from this stone

Born king of all Britain

Upon a new year's day
A host of knights did pray
That from the anvil one could draw the sword.
As each knight took his turn
They found the anvil, held it firm;
None worthy of a future king and lord.
Sir Kay the bravest knight
Appeared to try his might
He dreamed of being king, as all the rest
To Arthur Sir Kay called to search
And bring for him a sword
In earnest Arthur set about his quest.
A churchyard in the wood
The sword and anvil stood
And Arthur drew the sword out of the stone
The anvil now defeated
His quest for the sword completed
A sword that was to place him on the throne
A sword that was to place him on the throne.
Sir Hector and Sir Kay saw the sword
And knelt to pray

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Rick Wakeman,"By horse, by rail, by land, by sea, our journey starts
Two men incensed by one man's journey from the past
In Iceland, where the mountain stood with pride
They set off with their guide
To reach the mountain side

Roped as one for safety through the long descent
Into the crater of volcanic rock they went
Look up from our telescopic laair,
One star for us to share,
We continue on our prayer.

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.

Memories of a life on earth go flashing past,
Of home, of Grauben, friends of whom he's seen his last
Contemplating what his life's been worth,
While trapped beneath the earth,
An embryo at birth

Pain and fear destroy the beauty I have seen,
Of caverns, where no other man has been
Silurian epoch hosts me as my grave,
My final blow I wave,
A life too late to save

Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.


Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.

The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
  frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise

Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""

The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving downn to the depths in a single motion

Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye stained ocean read
Battle won, a victor's pride, the three men thanked the Lord and cried
""Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God.""

Journey on through ages gone, to the centre of the earth
Past rocks of quartz and granite, which gave mother nature birth

Burial ground of ancient man, his life no more is seen,
A journey through his time unknown, I wonder where he's been

Wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been

The shore now gone behind the hills, a forest in our sight,
Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light

Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream

Brownish hue dicates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere

Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age

Their shepherd came, now long extinct, a huge primeval man
The three men filled with disbelief, just turned as one and ran.

Hark through dark ties that tunnel us out of sane existence
In challenge as direct as eyes see young stars assemble

Master of soul set to touch all impenetrable youth

Rick Wakeman,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Rickey Woodard,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Rickey Woodard,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Rickey Woodard,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness

I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness

Of a great love for me.
Ah yes, I was wrong.
Again, I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still

Was quite so handsome and quite so tall

Are written right before us

All the way into the pool of blood at the bottom of hell
Far above in heaven a bird flys through the terrible cloud of unknowing
Trust can make a man into a wood, trust can make a man green

An everything that longs to Be
Broken and small enough to see
To be held in his hands
To be a part and yet alone

Here he is, reaching for the speed of light
Here he is, reaching for the sound of forgiveness

Been a moth, when she woke up on her knees, everybody made her say please

I was in a wild place where I go, I couldn't hear you
Julie found god in a bus station and she liked it a lot

What was yellow, what was white, what was day, what was night

And follows you in shapes of rain and dew
And you walk through the fun house,

And they close their eyes and they bow their heads
And they say, ""Let us pray"" and

It feels so cold and meaningless
And I wanted to pray and I said
Tell me father, tell me mother
Heavenly Mother and they said

When you pray, pray alone by yourself
In the secret room of your heart
Don't go out into the church filled with people and pray
God hears every secret that you say

See all those people praying on TV and in the churches
They like to make a big parade out of what they're doing
They think God hears them louder if they say it
Over and over and over and over and over again

But I say, God, but I say this
You are the prayer, Your eyes are the prayer
Your hand on your cheek, You are the prayer
Those words you want to speak, they are the prayer

That dance you make when you're by yourself
Just before your mother calls you on the phone
You are the prayer
I tell you what, you gotta take it back from them
Because the prayers belong to you

All you gotta do is say hey, hey
I'm down here too, I'm down here too, I'm down here too
And I hear you in the trees, and I hear you, and I'm near you

Jugar por tu piel, llenarme de ti 
Te quiero ver envuelta entre las nubes
Hasta perder la razon por mi",Corazon Entre Nubes (Coracao Nas Nuvens)
Ricky Martin,"Sin querer me he vuelto a enamorar
No será que siempre ocurre a mi edad?
Fue un amor relámpago
Que me haré combatir

Eres mi principio, mi final
El infierno el cielo y todo lo demás
Por un beso tímido
Te da mi corazón

Fuego contra fuego es amar
Fuego del que no puedo escapar
Donde nadie oye mi voz
Ahí te espero yo

Fuego contra fuego es amar
Y no lo podemos evitar
No le busques explicación
Lo nuestro es puro amor

Sin querer me he vuelto a enamorar
No será que siempre ocurre a mi edad?
Con un beso tímido
Te da mi corazón

Fuego contra fuego es amar
Fuego del que no puedo escapar
Donde nadie oye mi voz
Ahí te espero yo

Fuego contra fuego es amar
Y no lo podemos evitar
No le busques explicación
Lo nuestro es puro amor",Fuego Contra Fuego
Ricky Martin,"Cada vez que quedamos es igual
Las cosas que me dices
No me van a embrujar 
Se hace tarde me voy ya no vez 
Que si me quedo 
Se van a enojar

No lo puedo hay un error
Que nunca se detienen 
Para nuestro amor me dices,
Mira pronto volveré mañana 
Nos veremos de nuevo otra vez

Juego de ajedrez quererte tanto
Que difícil es tener tu amor
Juego de ajedrez quererte tanto
Que difícil es tener tu amor

No por favor no me lo vuelvas hacer
Ya no quiero falso movimiento otra vez",Juego de Ajedrez
Ricky Martin,"Mi amor entero es de mi novia, Popotitos
Sus piernas son como un par de carrisitos 
Y cuando a las fiestas la llevo a bailar 
Sus piernas flacas se parecen quebrar 

Popotitos no es un primor 
Pero baila que da pavor 
A mi popotitos yo le di mi amor 

Popotitos baila rock'n roll 
Y no la ves ni con la luz del sol
Es tan delgada que me haré pensar 
Que en plena lluvia no se va a mojar 

Popotitos no es un primor 
Pero baila que da pavor 
A mi popotitos yo le di mi amor 

Cuando hay aire fuerte la parece volar 
A Miss Universo nunca va a llegar 
Con popotitos me voy a casar 
De ahí en adelante la voy a alimentar",Popotitos
Ricky Martin,"Te encontré como en un sueno 
Mis palabras torpes sin saber que más decir
Y me pierdo en tus ojos 
Ellos hablan mucho más que tu 

Nos quisimos poco a poco 
Un amor así no se podría terminar
Mil promesas mil deseos 
Que no se conforman como sonar 

Yo pondría el mundo a tus pies
Tienes que creerme ya lo ves 
Se que estas desesperada 
y que lloras con tu almohada
Junto a ti yo se que puedo ser feliz 

Ser feliz, ser feliz siempre junto a ti 
Ser feliz saber que es así 
Ven acércate a mi 

Ser feliz, ser feliz locos por vivir 
Ser feliz para descubrir una historia sin fin",Ser Feliz
Ricky Martin,"Sentada estabas en la sala 
Con buen ambiente musical 
Aguardando el momento 
Que te abrazara tu galán 

Todo temblor lleno tu cuerpo 
Cuando llegue y te bese 

Susana, Susana, Susana 
Me muero por tu amor 

Sentí tus manos en mis hombros 
Corrían mis dedos por tu piel 
Era un momento increíble 
Valió el tiempo que espere 

Cuando el teléfono sonó 
Conocí su voz preguntando,
 que haces ahí? 
Que horror es mi novia 
Yo me sentí morir 
Me volvió a encontrar, 
Por que hoy, porque a mi, 
porque?

Susana, Susana, Susana 
Necesito tu calor 
Susana, Susana, Susana
Hazle caso por favor 

Volví a sentarme a tu lado 
Busque tus labios otra vez 
Quizás no supe ser el mismo 
Al intentar disimular 

Y te sentí fría y distante 
Pensando se me va 

Susana, Susana, Susana 
Estoy loco por tu amor 

Y continuamos en la fiesta 
Pronto empezó a amanecer 
La magia se nos fue volando 
Y yo la quise detener 

De pronto dijiste 
Me voy, dijiste adiós 
Y yo dije no 

Susana, Susana, Susana 
Necesito tu calor 
Susana, Susana, Susana
Cerca de su corazón 
Estoy loco por tu amor",Susana
Ricky Martin,"Hey bienvenidas 
Huh, que suenen esas palmas 
Por ser mis amigas 
Huh, eso es 
Muy bien vamos ya 

Vengo con ganas de querer 
Se ve se ve 
Busco un corazón que lata bien
Yo también yo también 

Que adore el sol caliente del verano 
Pasión, pasión 
Que vuele como oír una canción
Que emoción, que emoción 

Los dos amarraditos 
Tan cerca tan sólitos 
Todo lo que haré un gran amor 

Locos por sonar, sin querer parar 
Que nos sobre el tiempo para amar 
Amar, amar 

Ven que amo la vida y soy feliz 
Huh si, por mi por mi 
Ven que bailo salsa y rock'n roll
Yo voy, yo voy 

Te busco amiga y te quier llevar si 
Ven ya ven ya 
Los besos y abrazos van después
Tu y yo, tu y yo 

Bueno ahora todo el mundo cantando",Te Voy a Conquistar (Vou Te Conquistar)
Ricky Martin,"En un instante tu amor es causa 
De aventura nueva 
De temores y vencida esperanza 

Y sobre todo de un deseo 
Quebrante de dejar de amar 
Y desifrarte 

En un instante te me vuelves aire 
Y me descubres 
Hoja fresca y a placer me mueves 
Tu me sabes llevar 

Vuelo no pertenezco al suelo
Entre tus manos vuelo  
Como me quieres quiero vuelo 

No detenerme ya no descender 
Jamas de este vuelo
Juegame con tus besos 
Entre tus dedos vuelo 
Alas que son del cielo vuelo 

No detenerme ya no descender 
Jamas de este vuelo 
No pertenezco al suelo 

Me revelaste la pasión sin pausa
Piel que no se cansa de sonar 
Con un encuentro más 
Y desatar este deseo 
Quemante de dejarme amar y decifrarte",Vuelo
Ricky Martin,"Que me pasara
Cuando te quiero conquistar
Nunca he sabido que decir

Ricky Martin,"Ella es sedosa
Divertida y engañosa
Le tiene alergia a la verdad
Cuando le hablo seriamente
Me dice cosas intrascendentes 

Pasa de todo
Es feliz de cualquier modo
Más libre que la libertad
Es una cometa sin destino
Un desatino
Un juego prohibido 

Ella es
La chispa que enciende a mi,
La que miente por huir de lo real
No se disculpa porque es natural
A la que quiero
Sin ningún pero
Es así

Es ella y ella me va a mi
Porque nunca me quiso conquistar
Por la que pierdo hasta mi identidad
y es que es sincera
A su manera 

Es mariposa
Es la espina y es la rosa
Es un diamante sin tallar
Incluso adoro sus defectos
y sin su cuerpo
Soy un hombre muerto 

Ella es la chispa que me enciende a mi
La que miente por huir de lo real
No se disculpa porque es natural

Ricky Martin,"Yo quisiera quererte
Lo sabes bien
Que no puedo entregarme
También
Me pareces sincera
Pero aun así
No me siento empapado
De ti 

Tengo pocos amigos
O lo que es igual
No los siento conmigo
Cuando estoy mal
Cuando estoy arriba
Vienen a mi
No quisiera que fueras así 

Yo quisiera confiar
Poderme ilusionar
Poder amar y ser amado
Yo no puedo ser feliz
Pues no se distinguir 
entre el amor y los halagos
Yo prefiero no sonar
Vivir mirando al mar,
Como un ermitaño 

Yo quisiera quererte
Comprenderme
Solo es un problema de fe
No se como lo haremos
Decirlo
Sabes bien lo que pienso del amor 

Yo quisiera confiar

Poder amar y ser amado
Yo no puedo ser feliz,
Pues no se distinguir

Entre el amor y los halagos",Entre el Amor y los Halagos
Ricky Martin,"Eres como el agua
Que entre los dedos se va
Eres como el aire
Que no se puede tocar

Eres y no eres
Estas y no estas
Te tengo y no te tengo
En realidad

Eres como el humo
Que del fuego se va
Eres como el cielo
Que no se puede alcanzar

Estas y no estas
Te tengo y no te tengo
En realidad

Que alta esta la luna
Y tu que lejos estas
Te quiero prisionera
Pero como apresar el mar

Que alta esta la luna
Y tu que lejos estas
Naciste aventurera
Y no te puedo controlar

Eres como el tiempo
Que no se puede frenar
Eres como una noche
Que con el dia se va

Eres y no eres
Estas y no estas
Te tengo y no te tengo

Que mas da",Eres Como el Aire
Ricky Martin,"Es mejor a veces un adiós
Que ver como llega el desamor,
Y prefiero recordar lo que fuimos
Que continuar viviendo casi como enemigos 

Para que sonar, se fue el calor
No es culpa de nadie y de los dos 

Es mejor decirse adiós
Que seguir sufriendonos
Y asistir a este naufragio
Entre tu y yo
Y aunque nada quede ya
Ni siquiera la amistad,
Cuando menos que nos quede
Un buen sabor

Se que volveremos al error,
De intentar dar vida a un viejo amor,
Pero entonces ya será tan distinto
Jamas despierta una pasión
Cuando se ha dormido

Para que sonar, acéptalo
Se nos ha escapado el corazón

Es mejor decirse adiós
Que seguir sufriendonos
Y asistir a este naufragio
Entre tu y yo,
Y aunque nada quede ya
Ni siquiera la amistad,
Cuando menos que nos quede
Un buen sabor

La nostalgia nos engranará
Pero sabes cual es la verdad

Es mejor decirse adiós
Que seguir sufriendonos
Y asistir a este naufragio
Entre tu y yo,
Y aunque nada quede ya
Ni siquiera la amistad
Cuando menos que nos quede
Un buen sabor",Es Mejor Decirse Adios
