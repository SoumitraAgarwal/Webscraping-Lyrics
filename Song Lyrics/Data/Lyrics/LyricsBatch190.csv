Jerry Douglas,"On a Monday, I was arrested 
On a Tuesday, I was locked up in jail 
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested 
On a Thursday, nobody would go my bail 

Almost done, I'm almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

Take these stripes, stripes from around my shoulder 
Take these chains, these chains from around my legs 
Lord, these stripes, it sure don't worry me 
But these chains, these chain's gonna kill me dead 

Yes, I'm almost done, almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

On Friday, my baby went a-walking 
On a Saturday, she locked me outa the door 
On a Sunday, we were sitting down a-talking 
On a Monday, she pawned all of my clothes",On a Monday
Jerry Douglas,"It's not my nature to be patient
Cause I jump every river I cross
Not one for following the sensible side
I can't count the times I've been lost
Well, you can't see where you're goin' in the pourin' rain
When you're runnin' into walls and feeling no pain
We all owe dues to the devil and I've paid mine
It took a while to get here, but I'm right on time

I don't regret one single moment
It's been one hell of a ride
I count myself among the fortunate ones
Who made it to the other side

Well, you go what you go through to get where you are
Lucky for me I didn't go too far
I turned around before the end of the line
Took a while to get here, but I'm right on time

Well, you can't see where you're goin' in the pourin' rain
When you're runnin' into walls and feeling no pain

Jerry Embree,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Jerry Ernst,"Maxwelton's braes are bonnie
Where early fa's the dew
And 'twas there that Annie Laurie
Gave me her promise true.
Gave me her promise true
Which ne'er forgot will be
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I'd lay me doon and dee.
Her brow is like the snowdrift
Her throat is like the swan
Her face it is the fairest
That e'er the sun shone on.
That e'er the sun shone on
And dark blue is her e'e
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I'd lay me doon and dee.

Like dew on th'gowan lying
Is th' fa' o' her fairy feet
And like the winds in summer sighing
Her voice is low and sweet.
Her voice is low and sweet
And she's a' the world to me
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I'd lay me doon and dee.

Jerry Ernst,"The hours sad I left a maid
A lingering farewell taking
Whose sighs and tears my steps delayed
I thought her heart was breaking
In hurried words her name I blest
I breathed the vows that bind me
And to my heart in anguish pressed
The girl I left behind me

Then to the east we bore away
To win a name in story
And there where dawns the sun of day
There dawned our sun of glory
The place in my sight
When in the host assigned me
I shared the glory of that fight
Sweet girl I left behind me

Though many a name our banner bore
Of former deeds of daring
But they were of the day of yore
In which we had no sharing
But now our laurels freshly won
With the old one shall entwine me
Singing worthy of our size each son
Sweet girl I left behind me

The hope of final victory
Within my bosom burning
Is mingling with sweet thoughts of thee
And of my fond returning
But should I n'eer return again
Still with thy love i'll bind me
Dishonors breath shall never stain
The name I leave behind me ",The Girl I Left Behind Me
Jerry Ernst,"1.
Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Far from the safe quiet harbor we've rode,
Seeking our Father's celestial abode,
Promise of which on us each he bestowed;
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

2.
Wildly, the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Look, yonder lie the bright heavenly shores,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Steady, O pilot, stand firm at the wheel;
Steady, we soon shall outweather the gale;
Oh how we fly 'neath the loud creaking sail:
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

3.
We'll tell the world as we journey along,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Try to persuade them to enter our throng,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Come trembling sinner, forlorn and opprest,
Join in our number, Oh come and be blest;
Journey with us to the mansions of rest:
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

4.
Into the harbor of heaven we glide,
We're home at last; home at last!
Softly we drift on its bright silver tide,
We're home at last; home at last!
Glory to God, all our dangers are o'er;
We stand secure on the glorified shore:
""Glory to God"" we will shout evermore;
We're home at last; home at last.
",Homeward Bound
Jerry Ernst,"""Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

    

T'was Grace that taught...
my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
the hour I first believed.

    

Through many dangers, toils and snares...
we have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
and Grace will lead us home.

    

The Lord has promised good to me...
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be...
as long as life endures.

    

When we've been here ten thousand years...
bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise...
then when we've first begun.

    

""Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,    
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

Jerry Ernst,"'Mid pleasures and palaces
Though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble,
There's no place like home.
A charm from the skies
Seems to hallow us there,
Which seek thro' the world,
Is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.

I gaze on the moon
As I tread the drear wild,
And feel that my mother
Now thinks of her child;
As she looks on that moon
From our own cottage door,
Thro' the woodbine whose fragrance
Shall cheer me no more.
Home, home, sweet sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.

An exile from home,
Splendor dazzles in vain,
Oh, give me my lowly
Thatched cottage again;
The birds singing gaily,
That came at my call:
Give me them and that
Peace of mind, dearer than all.
Home, home, sweet sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home. 
",Home Sweet Home
Jerry Ernst,"I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Borne, like a vapor, on the summer air; 
I see her tripping where the bright streams play,
Happy as the daisies that dance on her way. 
Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour,
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er: 
Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

I long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile, 
Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile; 
I hear her melodies, like joys gone by, 
Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die:
Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,
Wailing for the lost one that comes not again: 
Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low, 
Never more to find her where the bright waters flow. 

I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed 
Far from the fond hearts round her native glade; 
Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown, 
Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone. 
Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore 
While her gentle fingers will cull them no more: 
Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.  

",Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair
Jerry Ernst,"There's a yellow rose in Texas, that I am going to see, 
Nobody else could miss her, not half as much as me. 
She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart, 
And if I ever find her, we nevermore will part. 

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your Clementine, and sing of Rosalee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me. 

When the Rio Grande is flowing, the starry skies are bright, 
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night: 
I know that she remembers, when we parted long ago, 
I promise to return again, and not to leave her so.

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your Clementine, and sing of Rosalee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me. 

Oh now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe, 
And we'll sing the songs together, that we sung so long ago 
We'll play the bango gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore, 
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore.

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your Clementine, and sing of Rosalee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me.

Jerry Fuller,"I've seen the snow-white mountains of Alaska
I've sailed along the rivers of Peru
I've seen the world and all its Seven Wonders
But I've never seen a wonder like you

I've stood upon the pyramids of Egypt
Far away across the ocean blue
I've seen the island beauties of Hawaii
But I've never seen a beauty like you

I've gazed at the White Cliffs Of Dover
There's not a place I didn't see
Now that my travels are over
I wish you had been there with me

I've seen the pretty dancing girls of Siam
The happy Polynesian people, too
But they're not as happy as I am
'Cause they haven't got a wonder like you

Jerry Garcia,"All I know is something like a bird within her sang,
All I know she sang a little while and then flew on,
Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.

If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by,
Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night.

Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore.
Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind.

Jerry Garcia,"Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose,
You and me bound to spend some time wond'rin' what to choose.

Don't you let that deal go down, no, no.

If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears.
Goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and play it slow,
Wait until that deal come round,

Since you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes,

Jerry Garcia,"If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Ebony
Don?cha push me, baby, 'cause I'm all alone
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around across the white world over
And you'll never find another on this man

Last man here in the country, sweet Susie
Last man here in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my dear go down, go down

Don?cha push me, baby, 'cause I'm all alone
Well, I know a little something you won't never know
Don'cha touch hard liquor, just the cup of cold cold feet
Gonna get up in the morning and go

Everybody?s breakin' and drinkin' that wine

Jerry Garcia,"I guess you think I'd never want to harm you
You better beware, that dream you dreamed
In time it could demand
The very ground on which I stand

Maybe you think that I am just a stranger
Or maybe recall I knew your name
You wrote it on the wall
In letters black and tall

Way down, way down in midnight town
Way down
Way down, way down in midnight town
Way down

When midnight dawns
Upon each painted martyr in the circus
Maybe you'll recall we met before
So please don't you accuse me
Of dealing with you loosely

Way down

Way down, way down in midnight town

Jerry Garcia,"Mama said, ""Don't go near that river,
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John.""
Come in the morning I'd always be there,
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

Take me back to another morning, to a time so long ago,
When the sweet magnolia blossomed, cotton fields as white as snow.

Catfish John was a river hobo who lived and died by the river's bed,
Looking back I still remember I was proud to be his friend.

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river,
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John.""
Come in the morning I'd always be there,
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg, traded for a chestnut mare,
Lord her never spoke in anger though his load was hard to bear.

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river,
Come in the morning I'd always be there,
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

Jerry Garcia,"Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe.""
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill,
Only love can fill.

Been walking all morning went walking all night
I can`t see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind And I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain.

Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the the dreams you still believe.""
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill,
Only love can fill.

From day to day just letting it ride.
You get so far away from how it feels inside.
You can't let go cause you're afraid to fall,
But the day may come when you can't feel at all.

The words come out like an angry stream.
You hear yourself say things you could never mean.
When you cool down you find your mind.
You got a lot of words you've got to stand behind.

Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe.""

No one is complaining, no, come in and shut the door,

You can't find a ride like that no more,
The night the chariot swung down low
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go.

Tune to the whistle going round the bend,
No great hurry, what do you say?

Then switch over to the cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues,
Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose.

Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when you need it the most
Work on the box car, beat on the bell
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well.

Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well,

I'd like to have it one time more

Slipping out of the bed
You thought that I was fast asleep

Heard your slippers in the midnight hallway
And I heard you rustling around
Trying not to make a sound

Heard the tap of your high heels
And the click of the lock on the door
Baby, I hope you know what you're doing

Heard you walking down the stairs
And I counted them one by one
One for each year that flew by

Heard you stop and turn back once
Then I thought that I heard you sigh
Or maybe it was the breeze

Heard the jingle of your keys
Then you stumbled and cursed the cat
That was sleeping on the stairs under the stars

Heard you open the car door softly
You must have been there half an hour
Turning it all round in your head

Were you sitting there waiting
For me to come down and call your name?
I wonder, were you waiting for me
Waiting for me, waiting for me, waiting for me

Then I heard the motor turn over
And I heard you driving away
Way before the break of day

Heard your engine for a long, long time
'Cause the night was so cold and quiet
As you made your getaway in the night

I'm troubled, I'm troubled
I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me
Lord I'll live a long time

Courting is pleasure
And parting is grief
But a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

For a thief will just rob you
And take what you crave
But a false hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave

(Chorus)

And the grave will decay you
And turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred
That a poor boy can trust

They'll hug and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than the cross ties on a railroad
Or the stars in the sky

(Chorus)

I'm going to Georgia
I'm going to Rome
I'm going to Georgia
Gonna make it my home

I'm gonna build me a cabin
On the mountain so high
So the world bird and the turtle dove
Will hear my sad cry

Jerry Garcia,"Cherise was brushing her long hair gently down
It was the afternoon of carnival as she brushes it gently down
Rubin was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade played in the carnival parade

Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight Cherise beware tonight
Rubin, Rubin tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do, Is there another girl for you?

If you could see my heart you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

When Rubin played on his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke to the painted mandolin

Looking out to the crowd who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Rubin stared, at Rubin stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Rubin's song took on a different tone and he played it just for her
The song he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate it cut through like a blade

Rubin was playing his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone for the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Rubin, Rubin tell me true for I have no one but you

If you could see my heart you would know it true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind without a look behind
Rubin walked the streets of New Orleans till dawn

Jerry Garcia,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it

Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off

Just Louise and her lover
So entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
And the all night girls they whisper of
Escapades out on the ""D"" train

We can hear the night watchman
Click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them
It's insane

Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here

The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost
He takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery
He likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall

Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, 'This is what
Salvation must be like after a while'
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles

See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say
""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""

Oh, jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""

But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him

And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road

He writes every thing's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes

The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain

As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.",Tangled Up in Blue [#][*]
Jerry Garcia,"I could give up my friends I know
And in return you could give up yours

Before we think, what would we do later on?
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both were wrong?

I give up my woman you give your man
But it don't make sense to take the chance

Jerry Garcia,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens

And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain""

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin

""Would you please not stare at me like that,"" he said
It's just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide

Well, Judas, he just winked and said
""All right, I'll leave you here
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear""

I'm gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you'll be
Judas pointed down the road
And said, ""Eternity""

""Eternity,"" said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
""That's right,"" said Judas Priest, ""Eternity
Though you might call it Paradise""

""I don't call it anything""
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
""All right,"" said Judas Priest
I'll see you after a while

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feelin' low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene

Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest""

""Oh, yes, he is my friend""
Said Frankie Lee in fright
I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight

""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
Well, my message is, he's down the road
Stranded in a house

Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand

""What kind of house is this,"" he said
Where I have come to roam?
""It's not a house,"" said Judas Priest
It's not a house, it's a home

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over everything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll

He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in every one

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep

For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst

No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest,
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest

And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
Nothing is revealed

Well, the moral of the story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong

So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'
Help him with his load
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

Jerry Garcia,"Come all you young fellows so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune way down in the mine
It will form like a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood flows as black as the coal

[Chorus:]
It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
The danger is doubled and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

There's many a man I have seen in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like the fiend with his dope and the drunkard his wine
A man can have lust for the lure of the mine

[Chorus]

Oh when I am dead and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner a-digging my bones

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the
Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another
Notch.

I'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.

All your reindeer armies, are all going home

I'm only a face in the crowd
I'm all in the dark and afraid tonight
There's nowhere to run or to hide

With just a smile
And you're so blinded with desire

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?

I tried to warn you somehow.

Jerry Gray Orchestra,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Jerry Gray Orchestra,"Blue Rain, falling down on my window pane 
But when you return there'll be a rainbow
After the blue, blue rain 
And there's a blue star 
Looking down asking where you are 
But when you return there'll be a sunbeam 
Hiding the blue, blue star
Skies will be much brighter than they were before 
When you and love come strolling through the door 
Then there'll be no more blue rain 
Just the sound of my heart's refrain 
Singing like a million little blue birds 
After the blue, blue rain",Blue Rain

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Jerry Gray Orchestra,"Skylark, have you anything to say to me, 
Won't you tell me where my love can be? 
Is there a meadow in the mist 
Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

But my heart is riding on your wings 
So if you see them anywhere 
Won't you lead me there",Skylark

I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

A man is born but he's no good no-how

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets 

With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it 

It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat 

In the dark zone it's on 

And hell yeah I used to push packs 

Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs

See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend

And love's got me high

And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)

Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland

And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you

And only you can set me free

That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I 
And our ribbon in the sky

What do I see 
But a middleweight boxing fight 
A right spar here, a left hook there 
Two in one combination 
A standard fare 
One fighter he tries the Ali shuffle 
Guess I'll change the channel 
'Cause it's just another scuffle 

It reminds me of me and you 
It reminds me of what we used to do 

TV rerun watching James Dean 
Red jacket on, he looks like Martin Sheen 
I keep on thinking 'bout Natalie Wood 
She sure was looking awfully good 
That rebel may have looked so cool 
Heart's aflutter, but don't be fooled 
'Cause in the end he still lost his fight 
Tough luck, sonny, life's not nice

It reminds me of what we used to do 
It reminds me of high school 
Reminds me of five years of doing nothing 
Reminds me of five years without loving

Jerry Jeff Walker,"There's not much to say for what was mine today
But when tomorrow comes, I'll make my way
Had planned to build a dream or two today
But everything I tried turned out mistakes
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day

Casting nets catch dreams; try for what seems to be
Bend that willow round and shape things as I see
Finding that some cards are drifting in the sea
And no matter how I play them, they'll trick me
That was his day, tomorrow I'll be free

Today played unfair; left me hung up, nowhere
And though it tries to break me I don't care
Tried to bring my ship in tow to land somewhere
Today is just another chance that's left me there
Broken toys today, tomorrow's my repair

There's not much to say for what was mine today
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day

Heading down an open road
To New Orleans, maybe Mexico

The whole world topsy turvy, you feel like you're upside down
Everyday it's a push and a shove, ah, people trying to get around
Working hard, breaking even's good, to live you know you need to pay
Yea, I'm half way gone, I feel I got to stay
But I don't like living trapped this way
Get away, get away yea

Ah to be up and leaving this town, heading down an open road
With all that you own kinda thrown on the back seat
Thinking 'bout where you're going, to New Orleans, maybe Mexico

If only you could pack up everything you love
And everyone who'd even been your friend
Keeping close to you the things that make you strong
And carry them with you around the bend

The fear to move and meet the new can keep you in line
To go you know that something stays behind
Separate the good and bad, 'cause you know the kind
The world is passing you by, but right down the line, down the line

After twenty years he still grieves

And slightly down, hmmm.

But the love I feel for you Id chance again without regrets.
Standing on the road has been my song before, hmmmmm
And now somehow I'm forced to see me there once more

A love for others shouldn't lack in courage
Or shadows thicked in anger hold you down
Your love is always traveling there beside you
With the strength to turn this world around
In your mind you're free and love can blossom
In solitude you cultivate its range
You have in sight a life all men have dreamed of
You seek to make it happen in your days
On the street you meet with strung emotions
You've more respect for him than he himself
Your open gift of love for him's confusing
But love transcends while hatred fools itself
The way you live each thought is how you're moving
The direction of your dreams is where you go
The courage of your love to have importance
Is all you really need or have to show

Chorus:
Go ahead and live your life and love it every day
'Cause if you don't, I think you'll see
How it slowly slips away
Till one day you wake and find
All your dreams committed suicide and there you go
You got a dead man on your hands

Now everyone has other lives in mind
Once they've taken care of needs
But won't it blow their minds
How quickly time flies
And that's all to life that there's goin' to be

Bridge:
So be careful what you pretend to be
Choose it well what you think you're goin' to be
'Cause what you pretend is exactly what you'll be

We all admire a man who's free
One who dares to speak his mind
A friend who disagrees without apologies
But I've heard that leads to jail sometimes

Now if you've planned to live your life just so
A simple road without a bend
As you walk that line, I think you'll find friend
There's changes down the road you didn't figure in

",Dead Men Got No Dreams
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Jerry Jeff Walker

If there's anything in this world you want
Better go for yourself
Learn to pick it up with your own two hands
Don't count on somebody else

If there's a dream that you are working on
Don't be surprised
If any old thing that you're counting on
Just suddenly dies
Got to plan in advance what you know you'll need
And carry it up on your back
Got to keep the things you need really close at hand
And tote them in your bag

When you're alone be ready for rain to fall
On a sunny day
If ends just meet be ready to go outside
And break a leg
You may as well get it straight before you start
You've got a general plan
To walk a road here to there but be prepared
To dig it where you land

If lady luck supposed to come across
She won't come through
If there'e the slightest doubt things could go wrong
It's bound to fall on you
Oh I know it's nice to think that things work out
And we'll all make our goal
But I think a man is wise to only count upon
What his own two hands can hold

If by some chance your world should turn on you
Come a tumblin down
You'll be at the place that I was at
When I wrote this song

The air is full of something strange
No more at ease the geese fly stronger now
Because they know the seasons change

The gentle dove knows love is over now
Wanderlust sets him aflame
My heart must start to play the rover now
Because I know the seasons change

Summer's here and then it's gone
Spots are changing on the fawn
Spring and summer held my heart
But I can feel the winter breaking all of that apart
Through autumn leaves I see your face right now
Your dress is wet with the summer rain
And though we loved I must erase you now
Because I know the seasons change

I can see by the look in our eyes that we're finally windin' down

It's time we were headed home to beddie bye and dreams 

I'am headed for the 0. D. Corral 
I ust a little farther down the trail 
I'am headed for the 0. D. Corral

Well it's late in the evenin' all the stars are out tonight 
I am too-so I'm a gonna go trippin' home by the light 
Of little bitty rabbits by the road with little bitty flashlights 
Showin' me all the chuckholes in the road on our way back home tonight

Jerry Jeff Walker,"Well, yes, I guess the blues got me
Brought me pretty low this time
Down to where I'm tellin' you
Everything that's one my mind

She kept telling me
If I need to be so free
Well, I can just go off on my own

(CHORUS:)
All she left me holdin' was time on my hands
And all that left me livin' was half of the plans
Now all that's left for me to do
Is hold on to
Anything I think I can
But darling I love you . . .

Well, she's the kind
People find
Knows everything that's on your mind
And now she's gone
I guess this song
Will tell her how I feel this time

'Cause you know I can't be free
Knowin' that she's not with me
No, I just can't go on that way

And I can see you are an angel
With wings that won't unfold
Tune up your harp, polish your old halo

Sittin' there cryin', like I'm the first one to go

I can feel you but I just can't find you

Faces in your dreams, fingers in your back
Voices of the memories for cryin' out loud

I swear to you friend that old high life sure gives me a scare
Now I walked away lonely from those I thought would burn me
I blocked up my ears so that no one should learn me

But the lady beside me is the one, I have chosen
To walk through life with me, like a coat from the cold

I have flown like a bird from every cage that confined me
And broken every one of the ties that bind me
And I have danced me around, all those sad ol', sad ol' situations
And I've taken my share of those sweet invitations

But the lady beside me is the one, I have chosen
To walk through life with me, like a coat from the cold

But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
Now walk through life with her, like a coat from the cold

With the weeds growing tall between the tracks, 
And along one side runs a 
Rusty barbed wire fence and beyond there 
Sits an old tar paper shack.

Mississippi, you're on my mind, 
Mississippi you're on my mind.

I think I hear a noisy old John Deere in a field
Specked with dirty cotton lint, and below the
Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

[Chorus]

I think I smell the honeysuckle vine, 
The heavy sweetness like to make me sick. 
And the dogs, my God, they're hungry all the time 
And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

[Chorus]

I think I feel an angry oven heat, 
The southern sun just blazes in the sky. 
And in the dusty weeds, an old fat grasshopper jumps. 
I wanna make it to that creek before I fry.

The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn 
The moon was bright as a readin' light 
For a letter from an old friend back home 

And he asked me 
Why do you ride for your money 
Tell me why do you rope for short pay 
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And you're losin' your share 
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there 

He said last night I ran on to Jenny 
She's married and has a good life 
And boy you sure missed the track 
When you never come back 
She's the perfect professional's wife 

And she asked me 
Why does he ride for his money 
And tell me why does he rope for short pay 
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And he's losin' his share 
Boy he must've gone crazy out there 

Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights 
They've never seen a hawk on the wing 
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide 
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing 

Well I read up the last of my letter 
And I tore off the stamp for black Jim 
And when Billy rode up to relieve me 
He just looked at my letter and grinned 

He said now 
Why do they ride for their money 
Tell me why do they ride for short pay 
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And they're losin' their share 
Boy, they must've gone crazy out there 
Son, they all must be crazy out there

Makin' the same mistakes, we swore we'd never make again
And we're pissin' in the wind, but it's blowing on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

About the time I called this Guy it was four in the morning
Teach me the words to the song I was humming

He just laughed and he said that the ole grey cat is sneakin' down the hall
But all he wants to know is who in the hell is paying for the call

[Chorus]

Now this Nunn called me up, it was eight in the morning
Wanted to know how in the world am I doin'
He just laughed and he said get together boy, and fall on by the house
Some Gonzo buddies would like to play anything your's picking now

Now we worked and we suffered and struggled
Makin' our record till we got it right
Now we're waiting on the check to come sneaking down the hall

Lace your shoes with country blues
Ramble down that dusty ole road

Take your money down in the town
Gonna get rich in the game
Come on home drunk at day break
You got no room to complain

Cause the pot can't call the kettle black
Cause the train's all runnin' on the same ole track
Can't feel nothing but your life flyin' by
You got trouble on your hands, trouble on your mind

He must a passed it on down to me
None of the girls are pretty as Suzanne
But I like some that I see

Cause the pot can't call the kettle black
Cause the train's all runnin' on the same ole track

I'd like you better that way
So clap your hands and make up a song

",Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Butch Hancock

Well, I was standin' at a big hotel, just wishin' everybody well
If anybody paid me any mind, it was hard to tell
Then a big cop on his beat, took out his pistol and pointed at me
Lookin' down the barrel, I swore I saw the gates of hell
Standing at the big hotel

Well, I walked on down the avenue,
Just lookin' for someone that I looked like you
I couldn't see a face that seemed to ring a bell
And then I stopped beside the five and dime
Just window shoppin' and wastin' time
Along came a gal, she sold me all she had to sell
She left me standin' at the big hotel

Chorus:
And then I lost my mind, in the wilds of Hollywood
Then I spent some time in the shadows where I stood
And I let those cards fall just where they fell
And then I found myself, standin' at the big hotel

Lord, Lord, what's the matter with me
I pay so much for the song I sing
And all I'm doin' is singin' em to myself
It's like standin' in a stagnant stream
With no water in the world left to drink
I was down at the bottom of a dried up wishin' well
Just standin' at a big hotel

Chorus

How you've turned off to me
Like the closing of the door
When I search your eyes

And you wish that I weren't here

Won't you give me one more chance
To make it with you
Forget about the bad we had
Don't believe we're through
Come and lie with me

Cause you're the only thing
I've got to hold on to

Thought I knew all the ways

In the heat of summertime

Is somehow out of tune

Oh my dearest darling - you're on my mind tonight
Now that spring is coming I see the leaves are bright

Oh no, deeper than love

Oh that mountain music, it makes me think of you

But when I read your letters I remember those lines
Oh no, it's deeper than love

It's a simple beat of a heart, like a glove on the hand of time
Been so long we've been apart - when I remember your life,
I remember mine

Well somewhere the sun today's soakin' up a cornfield dry
But it's shining a love song on some snowy clouds
And I know my fingerprints will be brushed away
By the hard plate every day of the century

But the other night when you cried and you woke me up
Just to tell me of your bad dream
I held you close to be of some avail
Tryin' to hold the wind up with a sail

We turned again and stood upon that gentle land
It's a vulnerable drum of old moss and sand
We could rise up another hot naked wall if we stand tall
We can face it again, it's the same old wind

But last night when you cried and woke me up
Just to tell me it's all a bad dream
I tried to hold you to be of some avail
Like tryin' to hold the wind up with a sail

Whenever you cry and wake me up and tell me you know
That it's all a bad dream

Let your flower perfume out and let the winds come and caress you
As I walk this garden I am hoping I don't miss you
The things you taste and smell ain't what they seem
Don't you mind me girl, I guess I'm nothin' but a walking dream

The sun and moon both are right
We'll see them soon through all our days and night
But the colors I see in your eyes are fiery bright
I swear they blind the heavens with all their light
Come and see what your eyes cannot see

Close your eyes, child and look while I show you
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes just blow you
Someday we'll meet again and suddenly I'll know you
All the things that you see ain't what they seem to be

While the church bell and school bell toll their one note song
Come hear where your ears cannot hear

Close your ears child and listen while I tell you
Follow the darkest night, the sounds they may impel you
Even the song I'm singing may disturb or serve to quell you
All the sounds you hear aren't what they seem to be

Tell me that you love me
As we crossed the borderline.
If you're ever in Alaska, 
Take a message to my friend
That the glamor of the city life
Is as empty as the wind
It'll steal away love's joy;
It'll drive a heart stone blind
Makes a cold Alaskan winter 
Seem like something warm and fine.

Repeat [Chorus]
Oh, tell me how you love me as we cross that borderline",Cross the Borderline
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Rodney Crowell

I look for trouble and I found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
He said one move and you're a dead man friend
You ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
He left me hanging against a cold steel rack
You ain't living long like this

Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives
Son of a carhop and some all night dives
Daddy drove a stock car to an early death
He said remember son in his dying breath
You ain't living long like this
You can't live at all like this, oh no baby

You know the story 'bout the wheel go 'round
Don't let them take you there all down town
Ain't living long like this

I live for Angel she's a roadhouse queen
Make Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottle and I'm stumbling here
I'm in the jailhouse now
I ain't living long like this, oh no baby

You know the story about the jailhouse rock
Well go on and do it, don't get caught
You ain't living long like this, oh no baby
Go on and do it but don't get caught
Cause there all in the jailhouse now

Jerry Jeff Walker,"If they'll play another love song
And if that Miller High Life sign stays dim
And if you'll keep my glass full of whiskey
I'll whisper words I wish I'd said to him 
Just ask me to dance all the slow ones
Hold me close and take me 'cross the floor
I'll gently lay my head on your shoulder
And pretend this never happened before

I don't want to hear a sad story
We both already know how it goes
But if, tonight, you'll be my tall dark stranger
I'll be your San Antone rose

Well, I wish I could tell you I love you
I wish that he weren't always on my mind
If wishes were fast trains to Texas
Oh, I'd ride and I'd ride; how I'd ride

I don't want to hear a sad story
We both already know how it goes
But if, tonight, you'll be my tall dark stranger
I'll be your San Antone rose

I'll be your San Antone rose",I'll Be Your San Antone Rose
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Jerry Jeff Walker,"I'm going away to leave you, you said I'm going down that road
To see what I'll see you, see what I've never known
And one things resting on my mind, 
You said I'm off to see what I wonder I'll find
I'll be in the mountains of Mexico

Said I see smiling faces, off on farther down the road
There all in their places, each with a heavy load
Seemed like just good people tarnished by the sun
They all seemed to be living as one
Up in those mountains of Mexico

As the road winds onward, twists through unchanging lands
We look for Mr. Cancer, all we see is those tiny hands
And offer us sparkling rocks for bread
We just stopped and shared with the children what we had
Up in those mountains of Mexico

So we're coming home to see you, we've travelled that lonesome road
I'm gonna tell you, all the things that we've never known
And one thing's still on my mind
I keep on wondering what it was we went to find
Up in those mountains of Mexico",Mountains of Mexico
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Say if you're South of Oklahoma, east of New Mexico,
West of Louisiana, where Papa Charles always go
We gotta a little place called Texas
Where the women grow on trees
There right there for the pickin' good buddy
Just as easy as a man could please

[Chorus]
Run take a hold
You're gonna get young 'fore ya get old
Those Texas ladies are Texas gold
Kisses that are sweeter than cactus
Take no practice to love yeah

Now there east of Amarillo, a little south of old Dime Box
You can find a Cinderella 
Or a genuine Goldilocks
And if ya don't like no love attachments,
If your taste in women gets strange
You could probably find some things to live on,
Down in old La Grange

[Chorus]

You better run tell the world
You gotta have a Lone Star girl
With her cast iron curls
Her aluminum dimples
Cause she's so simple to love

Now she's probably in Dallas, maybe down in old Cowtown
I've heard em tell Texas women
Beat the others lyin' down
I just thought I might tell you
In case you were unaware
'Bout those northeast Texas women 
With their cotton candy hair

[Chorus]

You run dig a hole, 
You gonna get young before you get old
Now Texas women are Texas gold
Ah there sweeter than cactus

Easy to love, yeah, easy to love
Easy to love

[Chorus]

You run tell the world,
How you'll get Lone star girls
With their cast iron curls,
She's sweeter than cactus
And easy to love",Northeast Texas Women
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Well come gather around me friends of mine, 
While I sing to you about a minstrel band
Of children in their witches hats, 
Painting pictures with the pipes of pan

How a young boy and his sister played some tunes 
Upon a whistle made of tin
And led me through the flower gardens, 
Laughing at the postman's stubby chin

And in my dizzy stupor, 
I was trying to forfeit all I'd known
And listen to that music that could swirl me in a magic all it's own

But somewhere in the distance, 
You and I, we fought our monsters to a draw
It was in those days of books and wine, 
With Ferlin Getty grasping for a straw

And out along the highways, 
We journeyed far to find that mystic smile
Chasing down identities, 
My God we must have run a million miles

So we can teach the children, 
Nothing, nothing but survival in the desert bare
They can teach us how to laugh, 
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

So sing for us you children, 
Tinkle bells and rhyme the purple, greens and blues
Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you

Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you
'Cause you can teach us how to laugh, 
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair",Then Came the Children
