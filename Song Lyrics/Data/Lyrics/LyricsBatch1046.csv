Monty Python,"Why are we here , what's life all about?
Is God really real , or is there some doubt?
Well tonight we're going to sort it all out
For tonight it's the meaning of life

What's the point of all this hoax?
Is it the chicken and the egg time , are we just yolks
Ore perhaps we're just one of Gods little jokes
Well ça see'est the meaning of life

Is life just a game where we make up the rules
While we're searching for something to say
Ore are we just simply spiraling coils
Of self-replicating DNA?

In this life , what is our fate?
Is there Heaven and Hell ?
Do we reincarnate?
Is mankind evolving or is it too late?
Well tonight it's the meaning of life

For millions this life is a sad vale of tears
Sitting round with nothing to say
While scientists say we're just simply spiraling coils
Of self-replicating DNA

So just why, why are we here?
And just what, what, what, what do we fear?
Well çe soir, for a chance, it will all be made clear
For this is the meaning of life
See'est le sens de la vie, this is the meaning of life",Meaning of Life [Original Film Soundtrack]
Monty Python,"[PROF. JONES:] Good evening. 
One of the main elements in any assessment of the medieval open-field farming system is the availability of plough teams for the winter plowing. 
Professor Tofts of the University of Manchester puts it like this: 
(A rocking beat starts and a 60s-style folk rock song with some heavy Caribbean influence begins.) 

To plough once in the winter Sowing, and again in Lent,
Sowing with as many oxen
Sowing with as many oxen
As he shall have yoked in the plough
Oh yes
Oh yes
As he shall have yoked in the plough.
Oh yes
Oh yes 

[PROF. JONES:] But of course there is considerable evidence of open-field villages as far back as the tenth century. Professor Moorhead: 
(Dramatic metal chords, reminiscent of British punk or perhaps groups like Black Sabbath.) 
Theeeeeere's ev-i-de-ence
Theeeeeere's ev-i-de-ence
There's evidence (evidence)
Evidence (evidence)
Evidence (evidence?)
There's evidence (evidence!) 

Evidence of settlements with one long village street,
Farmsteads, hamlets, little towns - the framework was complete
By the tiiiiime ... (OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST!) The rural framework was complete
Rur-al
frame-work
wa-as
com-plete. 

[PROF. JONES:] This is not to say, of course, that the system was as sophisticated as it later came to be. I asked the Professor of Medieval studies at Cambridge why this was. 
[PROF. HEGERMAN:] (stuttering) Well, i-it may not have been a - a statutory obligation, but, uh, I mean, uh, a guy who was a freeman whuh - was obliged in the medieval system to... 
[PROF. JONES:] To do boonwork? 
[PROF. HEGERMANN:] That's right. There's an example, ah, from the village rolls, ah, in 1313. 
[PROF. JONES:] And I believe you're going to do it for us. 
[PROF. HEGERMAN:] That's right, yeah... 
(Pop beat sets in, reminiscent of the Beatles in their later period but with some of the spastic quality of a Joe Cocker.) 
Oh it's written in the village rolls
That if one plough-team wants an oxen
And that oxen is lent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the loooord's consent.
Yeah, yeah,
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
(na na na na)
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
(na na na na)
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
(na na na na)
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent

Rode forth from Camelot. 
He was not afraid to die, 
Oh brave Sir Robin. 
He was not at all afraid 
To be killed in nasty ways. 
Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin. 

He was not in the least bit scared 
To be mashed into a pulp. 
Or to have his eyes gouged out, 
And his elbows broken. 
To have his kneecaps split 
And his body burned away, 
And his limbs all hacked and mangled 
Brave Sir Robin. 

His head smashed in 
And his heart cut out 
And his liver removed 
And his bowls unplugged 
And his nostrils raped 
And his bottom burnt off 
And his penis

""That's, that's enough music for now lads, there's dirty work afoot."" 
Brave Sir Robin ran away. 
(""No!"") 
Bravely ran away away. 
(""I didn't!"") 
When danger reared it's ugly head, 
He bravely turned his tail and fled. 
(""I never!"") 
Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about 
And gallantly he chickened out. 
(""You're lying!"") 
Swiftly taking to his feet, 
He beat a very brave retreat.

Monty Python,"Presenter Hello, good evening, and welcome to
'Blackmail'! And to start tonight's programme, we go to
Preston in Lancashire, and Mrs Betty Teal!
Cut to a slightly blurred black and white photo of a
Housewife with her face blotted out by a black oblong.

Presenter Hello, Mrs Teal!
Cut back to presenter. He picks up a letter and reads
It.

Presenter Now this is for ?15 and it's to stop us
Revealing the name of your lover in Bolton.
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '?15' (which flashes on and off
Quickly)

Presenter So Mrs Teal...if you send us ?15 by return
Post, please, and your husband Trevor, and your lovely
Children, Diane, Janice and Juliet need never know the
Name of your lover in Bolton.
Cut to a nude man (except for a collar and a tie) at
Organ. He plays a few stirring chords. Cut back to
Presenter.

Presenter (as he speaks he holds up the various items)
And now...a letter...a hotel registration book...and a
Series of photographs...which could add up to divorce,
Premature retirement, and possible criminal proceedings
For a company director in Bromsgrove. He's a freemason,
And prospective Tory MP.. that's Mr S. of Bromsgrove...
?3,000...
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '?3000' (which flashes on and
Off)

Presenter ...to stop us from revealing your name, the
Name of the three other people involved, the youth
Organization to which they belong, and the shop where
You bought the equipment.
Cut back to nude man at organ with chords again. Cut to
Still of two pairs of naked feet and lower legs. Organ
Music over this. Cut back to presenter.

Presenter We'll be showing you more of that photograph
Later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or
Michael. And now it's time for our 'Stop the Film'
Spot!
SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'STOP THE FILM'

Presenter The rules are very simple. We have taken a
Film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant
Details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the
Victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But
Remember the money increases as the film goes on. So
The longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So
Now, with the clock at ?300 this week 'Stop the Film'
Visited Thames Ditton...
The following film is shot in murky 8mm. As the film
Progresses we have a ? sign with numerals in one corner
Which increase. Shot of a residental street in Thames
Ditton (sic). Another section of a street with a figure
In a Robin Hood hat and raincoat - in the distance on
The far side of the road, so we can't really make him
Out. Cut to slightly closer shot of him about to cross
The road. Cut to suburban house. The man is standing at
The door pressing the bell and looking round rather
Furtively. Again shot from some distance and over a
Hedge. Cut back to studio. The presenter looking at a
Monitor and then at a phone. Back to the film: a woman
Opens the door. She wears a dressing gown over
Lingerie. A shaky zoom in to reveal her clothing. Wide
Shot of the house with door shut. Jump cut to shot
Obviously taken from a window in the house. Shaky zoom
In on window. We can see in the window...both the man
And woman enter the bedroom. He goes out of shot,
Taking his coat off. Cut back to studio.

Presenter He's being very brave here...
Cut back to the film: even closer perhaps of window. A
Series of short jump cuts. She is undressing. She
Throws off her dressing gown. A jump and she's taking
Off her negligee. Underneath she wears black corsets.
She produces a whip and seems to be beckoning to the
Man. Phone rings. Cut back to the studio. The presenter
Picks up the phone.
Presenter Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure
You didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally
Censure, we just want the money...Yes, and here's the

Monty Python,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Every Sperm Is Sacred/Protestant Couple/Adventures of Martin Luther

Is that he was 5'6"" at the start of his reign,
But only 4'8"" tall at the end of it.

Because of

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Puritan)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September).
Was at first (only) MP for Huntingdon (but then)
He led the Iron Side Cavalry at Marston Moor in 1644 and won.
Then he founded the New Model Army, and praise be, beat the Cavaliers at Naseby.
And the King fled up North, like an axe, to the Scots.

But under the terms of John Pimms' 'Solomn League and Covenant',
The Scots handed King Charles I over to

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (and his warts)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September)
But, alas (Oi Vay!), disagreement then broke out (between)
The Presbyterian Parliament and the military
Who meant to have an independent bent and so,
The second civil war broke out and the round head ranks
Faced the cavaliers at Preston, Lancs.,
And the King lost again, silly thing (stupid King).

And Cromwell sent Colonel Pride
To purge the House of Commons of the Presbyterian Royalists,
Leaving behind only the Rump Parliament

Which appointed a High Court at Westminster Hall
To indict Charles I for Tyranny (gasp).
Charles was sentenced to death
Even though he refused to accept that the court had
Jurisdiction (say goodbye to his head).
Poor King Charles laid his head on the block (January 1649)
Down came the axe and

In the silence that followed,
The only sound that could be heard was a solitary giggle from.

And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,

Monty Sunshine,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Monty Sunshine,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,

Monty Sunshine,"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.",Carry Me Back to Old Virginny

I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

Mood,"[Main Flo]
I had to stay minal, when DEA stopped my gray rental
Incidental, my girl home watchin Jay Leno
Prophecize, I pulled the wise
Wit frame eyes for disguise, talkin like them white guys
Shallow demeanor, karma was the main schemer
What could be greener, when all I thought about was Beemers
Then came the questioning
Arrestin me was steppin rare
Askin permission so he could say he kept it fair
Fake mustaches and hundred yard dashes
Through lake molasses because my government's so facist
Don't choose to ass-kiss dolo spots
I did the massacus on all areas, harassless
Don't want to do enough confront a cew
That night I got two, went to sleep, woke up wit guns drew
No time for cryin cowards
Too late for fire power
Karma convinced me to leave him at his dying hour

[Chorus] 2x
Now leading back to that night
Reality strikes
Them unknown faces are the casualty types

[Donte]
When you watch yo' nigga rise and disguise
You despise 'cause I built an enterprise
While you still livin lies
And I'm all you want to be, but that's all you gonna be
Get your long path and yo' ass from in front of me
Niggas thought you had my back and you was stealin out my pack
When other niggas try to tell me ""I wasn't even feelin that""
That's my ace, that nigga got keys to my place
And he know about the cash, stashed G's in the safe
Wait, no time to waste when best friends player-hate
Relocate, can't sleep, now I gotta stay awake
And take a still break, 'cause I be dealin wit this ill fate
When niggas be fake, infiltrate and try to and steal weight

""The way I vex, will cause an insane karma"" [Del] 2x

[Main Flo]
All up on the humble
Fuckin wit fake niggas that know I bubble
Precise juggle, 'cause life is my type of struggle
Seven-fifty IL's, and tales of fly females
Who caught in these sales wit live details
Shades by Cartier, and big links that hardly play
It could be Auste, let's do this in a large way
I want to see the Amazon basing
To set out to gather my thoughts into a calm basement

[Donte]
Man ain't nuttin change, niggas don't know what they facin
Already steady pacin, they seeds to be replacements
We ain't the felon type  
Or into sellin white
'cause everything money bring, children of the malonites
I'm Bob's song, provin Ja live, not gone
To pay a devil on a loan, got to rob yo' own
No love wit no peace, gave life to the beast
As the defecit increase, Exodus outta Greece
This note is legal tender, depths connect, render
Evil spender, people mentors resurrect to evil vendor now

Chorus 2x

""The way I vex will cause an insane karma"" 4x",Karma
Mood Swing,"Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free, oh lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging 'round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see, oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and people don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and people don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues

Moodtapes,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I figured it out all I need is a car to be so strong
So here I sit on the hood of a Buick
I feel real cool and the chicks all dig it
Things are gonna change and I think it's happening now

Mama said, ""Oh, dear baby don't leave me""
But I'm a redneck adventurous pitch forked pup from the farm
Now I cruise on the high road to China
Got girls lined up way back to Ohio
Slicked back hair with pomade that just won't stop

And he said, ""Ahh shucks""

I wrecked that car on the night of my very first prom
Betty Lou got out and walked, in short, she was gone
So here I sit on this heap of a Buick
Best girl gone, oh I just knew it
Things are gonna change and I think it's happening now

Moonsorrow,"Tääl' lakeuksilla Pohjolan he asustelivat
Muuan pakanakansa lähes unhoon vaipunut
Ne vimmaiset, jotka veljiänsä puolustivat
He, joita kastettu ei aikonutkaan tunnustaa

He valloittivat, ryöstelivät kunniaksensa
Ja etenivät voittoisasti perääntymättä
Vaan samat aikeet toisella, heitä pahemmalla
Vihollisen vanhan saarella saivat kohdata

Koskaan eivät he uhkaa väistäneet
Tarttuivat kirveisiinsä jumalten
Vastus kuitenkin vahvistuneena
Päättänyt oli heidät musertaa

Oli kääntyvä uusi sivu
Taistelussa ruttoa vastaan
Eihän kunniaa voi saavuttaa
Jos jättää kokematta kuoleman

Jäätyi verensä hankeen

Valtakautensa lepää nyt pohjassa
Ylväs liekki sammui, vaan silti
Voittaja saa häpeää kantaa
He hukuttivat myös kunnian

Nyt valtaistuimella istuu väärä kuningas
Nälkäisten petojen kaitsija, peto itsekin
Vaan alistettu kansa tuo ei koskaan katoa
Voi menneisyyteen itse""mme emme unhoittaa

From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed,
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related,
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear,
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last,
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love

My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet...

My aftertime is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some want to die I want to stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy,

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle

Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh, I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry

Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!",Papa'z Song (Tupac & Mopreme)

Se quiser me largar
Você vem junto ou só para pra olhar
Olhe bem pra mim eu não to legal
Tentei de tudo eu não consigo parar
Se quiser me acertar
A hora é essa eu não vou revidar

Só que dessa vez
Você quer gritar
Enche o peito e diz
Que não da mais
Oh não
Me deixa ser em paz

Mas quem se importa
Ninguém se importa
Fazem de conta
Que querem o seu melhor

Moptop,"E todo dia ela aparece sem avisar
Me agarra, diz que nunca vai largar
Tudo é sempre igual
Tudo é sempre igual

E todo dia eu ensaio uma conclusão
Ela vem e me entope de paixão
Mas é tudo igual
Tudo é sempre igual

Não posso mais, não dá mais pra levar
Eu saio por ai pensando em não voltar
Mas volto atrás com medo de recomeçar
Mas é tudo igual
É tão igual
Ela é sempre igual

E todo dia ela me pede pra escolher
Entre ela e o jogo na TV
Tudo é sempre igual
Ela é sempre igual

E quando finalmente enxerga minha apreensão
Me beija com urgência e aflição
Mas é tudo igual
Tudo é sempre igual

Não posso mais, não dá mais pra levar
Eu saio por ai pensando em não voltar
Mas volto atrás com medo de recomeçar
Mas é tudo igual
É tão igual
Ela é sempre igual

Mora's Modern Rhythmists,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings

Que quiso apagar tu fuego

Se fue rompiendo el lazo que antes nos unía 
Y ahora sé que fue mi culpa dejarte 
Y sé que si vuelves
Voy a darte mil razones para amarme 
Voy a revivir los sueños

Revivir todas las noches sentados juntos al piano 
No te vayas, no me dejes solo, quédate conmigo 
Sé que aun sientes lo que sientes 
Sé que entiendes lo que digo

Sabes bien que yo (sabes bien que yo)
Yo te salve de mil tormentas (Siempre me amaste aunque te mientas) 
Pueden ser más, perdí la cuenta (Puedes salvarnos si lo intentas) 
Pues mi pronóstico fue estar contigo, estar contigo 
Y tú (solamente tú)
Si ya no hay sismo que te mueva (Si ya no hay nada que te mueva) 
Intenta verme y ponte prueba (Serán tus ojos los que lluevan) 
Pues tu pronóstico es estar conmigo
Estar conmigo",Mil Tormentas

Morbid Angel,"(Music : Azagthoth/Lyrics : Vincent)
Weak aside - no place for those our struggle
Leaves behind
Our Lord won¹t tolerate those whom through
Attrition fall
We must dominate !
With iron through our veins and a will made so elite
Hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
Hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey
Leading all the wonderers to certain fate
Another victim reviled
I¹m staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
Tell me who is going to save you now !
Animal sense ever alert
Praise be to the father-war
As a servant I am serving myself and I bathe in anticipation
Unless you taste it you could never know
All the power our Lord bestow
With a bow and a kiss profane
Be a victor or be a victim
",Dominate
Morbid Angel,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Destructos Vs The Earth/Attack

More are added everyday

Of humans for my foul play

'Cause once it's done it doesn't matter
Between the faith or fate I'm not confused
About my purpose no
Reduce them all in shame
And the bones will pave my kingdom

What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor

[Verse 1]
The name of this entertainement is 'Women lose weight'
Our first years of mariage everything was just great 
But after two kids And a weight gain factor 
The fact is Now she's completely unattractive 
Look fat chicks I don't mean to sound rude 
I tell her nice hit the gym And don't eat so much food 
But no Your shallow 
You need to run the course of unconditionnal love and so forth 
But how if desire's is not there That's just delayment 
Divorce is, child support, alimony payments 
My happiness I doubt discouraged 
So hurry for an easier way out of this marriage 
Meanwhile my secretary June well groomed 
When you gonna leave your wife I tell her soon mommy soon, I assume 
Or my destiny is blue Interestingly The only thing left for me to do is to kill her

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss

[Verse 2]
My plans against or shenanigans Kinda ran thin
Knowin' nothing about poisoning And I can't swim 
Bad intentions pumping Might as well become numb 
Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong 
But the catch is do I have the nerve to dispatch this 
Who can I get to help me murder this fat chick 
I guess I'll have to play a dude robbin 
On Wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping 
Anyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler 
And sent her clean over the divider 
""You bastard"" she said 
As the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought ""she has to be dead"" 
Later on get a call (from a) Lieutenant O'Rourke 
(had me) leapin like a frog We need you at the morgue 
So I selfishly pursue 
""boohoo"" there was nothing else for me to do I had to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
C'mon ya'll know I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss Kill her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 

[Verse 3]
So you mean to tell me officer you don't have no clue who did this hit and run 
No sir we don't have no clues right now 
This is terrible what am I gonna tell the kids? 
Pull yourself together sir 
I'm so broken up inside I just can't believe this 
I understand, I understand 
Catch the person who did this 
We're gonna try sir Please 
Screamin ""who done took my heart"" acting shakin up a lot 
At the funeral though everyone was lookin at me odd like I did it 
Like I was the reason my mates slain murmuring 
""I heard he was displeased with her weight gain"" 
While my secretary sort of a sexy blonde can't cook 
All she does is order from restaurants 
All of the sex you want I doubt could address, 
Clothes not washed proper and house look a mess and 
Talkin to detectives that was waitin outside 
How I took a long lunch break day the wife died 
I darn near turned pale 
And because of betrayal they indicted me, and gave me an impossible bail 
Good fortune to anyone admiring the rawtent 
Moral of the story is 
Desire is important 
So watch your weight It'll keep you mate smitten it's a given 
Though looking back I realised I didn't have to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 
I killed her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss

Mi sveglio col piede sinistro
Quello giusto

Forse già lo sai
Che a volte la follia
Sembra l'unica via
Per la felicità

C'era una volta un ragazzo chiamato pazzo
E diceva sto meglio in un pozzo che su un piedistallo

Oggi ho messo
La giacca dell'anno scorso
Che così mi riconosco
Ed esco

Dopo i fiori piantati
Quelli raccolti
Quelli regalati
Quelli appassiti

Ho deciso
Di perdermi nel mondo
Anche se sprofondo
Lascio che le cose
Mi portino altrove
Non importa dove

Io, un tempo era semplice
Ma ho sprecato tutta l'energia
Per il ritorno

Lascio parole non dette
E prendo tutta la cosmogonia
E la butto via
E mi ci butto anch'io

Sotto le coperte che ci sono le bombe
È come un brutto sogno che diventa realtà

Ho deciso
Di perdermi nel mondo
Anche se sprofondo

Applico alla vita
I puntini di sospensione
Che nell'incosciente
Non c'è negazione

Un ultimo sguardo commosso all'arredamento
E chi si è visto, s'è visto

Dalle pose e dalle posizioni

Morgan Fisher,"You're a beautiful boy
With all your little toys
Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul

Love is the answer and you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You got to let it, you gotta let it grow

So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time

Yes is the answer and you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You got to let it, you gotta let it go

Is it too much to ask for some honesty
From a boy who really is what he seems to be
I wish I knew which way to go
'Cause you can't find love on the yellow brick road

He was acting real smooth when I caught his eye
Silver tongued devil with an axe to grind
Said those things a girl likes to hear
Had a little way of whispering in my ear

But he played that game with every girl he met
I swear he didn't have a heart in his chest

'Cause you can't find love on the yellow brick road

He had long, blonde hair and a souped up Ford
Pulled up in the drive with a mighty roar
Played a good game, acted so tough
Had me believing that it could be love

But he tucked his tail between his legs
When it came to commitment, he was scared to death

Battle me that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up
Punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up, come on!
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust em in the eye
And then I'll take the punks home
Feel it, funk it
Amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down

So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Try and step to me you'll take your last breath
I gots the skill, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot ta give, I shoot to kill

I came to get down

So get out your seats and jump around

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try'n to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya

I came to get down

So get out your seats and jump around

And it didn't really sound quite the same

Since the day you carried me
Across that bridal path door

You've got no means for wanderlust

If you prefer it all to me then my love
You go down the longest road to nowhere
You pull it apart and you're just left there

Its my life, its my time, we've been gettin' nowhere

Hold me down, Hold me down
Hope will be found, Follow me

If you prefer it all to me then my love

You pull it apart and your just left there

And you're waving in it, and you're craving in it

I thought a hint, like doom

Tick tock, two minutes to go
I should have seen the signs years ago
Tried to warn them it was coming
Tried to tell them what I'd seen

I saw the towers crumble
I saw the long distance fall
And I can see how you'd think I'm crazy

Place that we go

In light of a dream

In the light of a dream
Place that we go
World that we know

In the layer in between
Of this life and a dream
In a place tied to the past
I should have known that it never lasts

I saw the people rising
I saw the great divide
And I could see how you think I'm crazy
But you're the one that tried to run and hide

For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all

Morgan!,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Morgan!,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

The one I've most adored
Is bored 
With me
Manhattan, I'm awf'lly nice
Nice people dine with me
And even twice
Yet the only one in the world I'm mad about
Talks of somebody else
And walks out

With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here am I
Facing tomorrow
Alone with my sorrow

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

And even though I tried, it all fell apart

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

While yet you are still

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Moriarty,"Was on the high high holy day
The best day of the year
Little Matty Groves went to church
A gospel for to hear

And first to come down was dressed in green
And the second one dressed in red
The third to come down was Lord Daniel's wife
Just as fair as any queen
Just as fair as any queen

Then Matty Groves says to one of his men
See the fair one dressed in white
Although she is Lord Daniel's wife
I'll be with her tonight
I'll be with her tonight

And little foot page he was standing by
And heard all that was said
He says Lord Daniel shall know tonight
Before I go to bed
Before I go to bed

He had fifteen miles for to go that night
And ten of them he run
He run 'til he come to the broke down bridge
Then he bent to his breast and he swum
He bent to his breast and he swum

He swum 'til he come to where the grass was green
Then took to his feet and he run
He run 'til he come to Lord Daniel's Gate
Then he rattled at the bells and he rung
He rattled at the bells and he rung

What news, what news, what news
What news have you brung
Little Matty Groves is in your bed with your wife
And their hearts both beat as one
Their hearts both beat as one

Now if the truth you've told me
A rich man you shall be
But if a lie you've told to me
I'll hang you to a tree
I'll hang you to a tree

Then he gathered him up about fifty good men
And he done it with a free good will
Then he popped his bugle to his mouth
And he blowed it loud and shrill
He blowed it loud and shrill

I'd better get up said little Matty Groves
I'd better get up and go
I know your husband is coming home
I hear his bugle blow
I hear his bugle blow

Lay down, lay down my precious one
Lay down and go to sleep
It's only my father's shepherd's horn
And he's a calling for his sheep
He's a calling for his sheep

So they laid down together again
And soon were fast asleep
When they awoke it was broad daylight

Get up from there you naked man
And put you on some clothes
I never intend for to have it said
That a naked man I slaught
That a naked man I slaught

Then Matty Groves struck the very first lick
And he wounded Lord Daniel sore
Lord Daniel struck the very next lick
And he drove Matty Groves to the floor
He drove Matty Groves to the floor

Then he taken his lady by the hand
And he sat her on his knee
And he says now which do you love the best
Little Matty Groves or me

Very well I like your rosy cheeks
Very well I like your chin
But better I love little Matty Groves
Than you and all of your kin

And dig it wide and deep
And put little Matty Groves in my arms

Singing that God
Sheds the tears I taste

Armed without a task

Soon there'll be flowers
And prayers that I used to know
Lifting forever

Ripping words off my lips to keep from asking
I fall when you call

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued
Land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a
Nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!",The Star Spangled Banner [US '93 Remix]
Mormon Tabernacle Choir,"Would God I were the tender apple blossom
That floats and falls from off the twisted bough
To lie and faint within your silken bosom
Within your silken bosom as that does now.
Or would I were a little burnish'd apple
For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold
While sun and shade you robe of lawn will dapple
Your robe of lawn, and you hair's spun gold.

Yeah, would to God I were among the roses
That lean to kiss you as you float between
While on the lowest branch a bud uncloses
A bud uncloses, to touch you, queen.
Nay, since you will not love, would I were growing
A happy daisy, in the garden path
That so your silver foot might press me going
Might press me going even unto death.","Londonderry Air (Danny Boy), folk song"
Mormon Tabernacle Choir,"A mighty Fortress is our God
A trusty Shield and Weapon
He helps us free from every need
That hath us now overtaken
The old evil Foe
Now means deadly woe
Deep guile and great might
Are his dread arms in fight
On Earth is not his equal

With might of ours can naught be done
Soon were our loss effected
But for us fights the Valiant One
Whom God Himself elected
Ask ye Who is this?
Jesus Christ it is
Of Sabbath Lord
And there's none other God
He holds the field forever

Though devils all the world should fill
All eager to devour us
We tremble not we fear no ill
They shall not overpower us
This world's prince may still
Scowl fierce as he will
He can harm us none
He's judged the deed is done
One little word can fell him

The Word they still shall let remain
Nor any thanks have for it
He's by our side upon the plain
With His good gifts and Spirit
And take they our life
Goods fame child and wife
Let these all be gone
They yet have nothing won

Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;

Mount of God's unchanging love.

Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Hither by Thy help I'm come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let that grace now like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.","Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing"

To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far

To fight for the right
Without question or pause

To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star","The Impossible Dream, song (from ""Man of La Mancha"")"

If you could only see my heart exploding
The blood and gore as my soul lays on the floor
Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve

The beacon faded just like our love
I wish I knew what happened so I could fix it
The damper on our relationship 
The pieces of the puzzle no longer fit 

I've become what I hate
Suddle little hints I'm on the other side of the fense for once
My thoughts of myself haunt me everyday
Inside you I could never breath again

Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
I don't know my next move to make
Once again living in checkmate

I hate being this stupid kid and everything that you did
Was so perfect, it's my fault I know
It's my fault I know
It's my fault I know

Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
Tied in these chains wishing the pain would go away

Never successful, never knew what real love was before
I mean it when I say I wish it was like it was
So much is going through my head
Regretting every word I said

I still love you, don't want anything to happen to you
Laying in my bed for hours and hours the pain won't..fucking..go away
How the hell am I suppose to be happy if your not?
Inside you I could never breath again

Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love

A most surprising weakness.

Pure pleasure or from the heart. 
Just another addiction. 
Will I ever gain control. 
Or will I make the same mistakes. 
Confusing love and physical lust. 
I continue to let it trap me.

And drove an English teacher half insane

Makes me feel so masochistic

And I would do anything, and I would do anything and Patty Hearst

You're standing there in front of the Symbionese
Liberation army flag with your legs spread
I was wondering will you get it every night
From a black revolutionary man and his women or whether you really did

And now that you're on the run what goes on in your mind
Your sisters they sit by the window
You know your mama doesn't sit and cry and your daddy
Well you know what your daddy said

Patty, you know what your daddy said
Patty, he said, he said, he said
Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child
Now here she is with a gun in her hand

Hey Joe, hey Joe, where're you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said where're you goin' with that gun in your hand?
I'm gonna go shoot my ol' lady
You know I found her messin' around town with another man
And you know that ain't cool, watch me

Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down to the ground, you shot her
Yes I did, yes I did, yes I did, I shot her, I shot her
I caught her messin' round with some other man
So I got on my truck, I gave her the gun and I shot her
I shot her, shoot her one more time for me

Hey Joe, where you gonna, where you gonna run to?
Where you gonna run to, Joe, where you gonna run to ?
Go get a cover, I'm gonna go down south
I'm gonna go down south to Mexico

I'm going down, down, down to Mexico where a man can be free
No one's gonna put a noose around my neck
No one is gonna give me life, no
I'm goin' down to Mexico, I'm going down

You're not going to hear 'em stand there
And look at the stars as big as holes in the arms
And the stars like a back truck electric flag
And I'm standing there under that flag with your carbine

Between my legs, you know, I felt so free of death beyond me
I felt so free, the F.B.I. is looking for me baby
But they'll never find me, no, they can hold me down like a
And I'm still on the run and they can speculate what I'm free

But daddy, daddy, you'll never know just what I was feelin'
But I'm sorry, I am no little pretty little rich girl
I am nobody's million dollar baby, I am nobody's patsy anymore
I'm nobody's million dollar baby, I'm nobody's patsy anymore
And I feel so free

Winter push on
(push on) 
Oh, winter push on 

Winter is so long 
Winter moves on

The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house, goodbye stairs
I was born here
And I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here

Love at first sight
It may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the detail
Of everything you ever wore or said
Or how you stood the day
As we spent the last night
On Maudlin Street
""Goodbye house, forever!""
I never stole a happy hour
Around here

Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I am - the ugliest man
Oh, the last night on Maudlin Street
Truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you

When I sleep
With that picture of you framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room, by the bed
(...yes, I told you it was silly...)

And I know
I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you
Came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
But, you know
No-one stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches
All around my head

Oh, the last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So he drove me home in the Van
Complaining, ""Women only like me for my mind...""
Don't leave your torch behind
A powercut ahead; 1972, you know

And so we crept through the park
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline
For you
But you...without clothes
Oh, I could not keep a straight face
Me - without clothes?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed

I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
With ""every hand waves me on""
(secretly wishing me gone)
Well, I will be soon
Ooh, I will be soon
I will be soon
I will be soon
Will be soon, I will be soon
Mmm...I will be soon, I will be soon

There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Inspector - don't you know?
Don't you care?
Don't you know - about love?

Your gran died
And your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain, and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things...oh
I took the key from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!
Oh, oh, truly I love you
Oh, wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you're singing now
Oh, I do hope 
I hope you're singing now
Oh...","Late Night, Maudlin Street"
Morrissey,"An afternoon nostalgia
Television show
You spoke in silhouette
(But they couldn't name you)
Although the panel were
Very polite to you
But I remembered you
From Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
Too old to be a child star
Too young to take leads
Four seasons passed
And they axed you
Nervously juvenile
(Won't smile!)
What became of you?
Did that swift eclipse torture you?
A star at eighteen
And then-suddenly gone
Down to a few lines
In the back page of a teenage annual
Oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you","Little Man, What Now?"

That it had to be so 
Avoiding ordinary boys 
Happy going nowhere, just around here 
In their rattling cars

Than the cold, small streets

But you were so different 
You had to say no 
When those empty fools 
Tried to change you, and claim you

Morrissey,"Such a little thing 
Such a little thing

Can you write?

So full of crashing bores,

And I must be one, 'cause no one ever turns to me to say
Take me in your arms,

What really lies,
Beyond the constraints of my mind,
Could it be the sea,
With fate mooning back at me
No it's just more lock jawed pop stars,
Thicker than pig shit,
Nothing to convey
They're so scared to show intelligence,
It might smear their lovely career

This world, I am afraid,
Is designed for crashing bores,
I am not one, I am not one
You don't understand,
You don't understand,
And yet you can,
Take me in your arms and love me,
Love me,

Take me in your arms and love me,

To be standing by the flag, not feeling shameful,
Racist or racial

And I will die with both of my hands untied

And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell,
And denounce this royal line that still salute him,
And will salute him

The Bureau supply for aging men)

Do you ? Do you ?

And make no mistake
It's the best you can do for everyone's sake

Kick the bride down the aisle
And treasure the day

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze
For the rest of her days
Write down every word I say

Kick the bride down the aisle
In a mudslide of gloom
She'll order you to tidy your room

Kick the bride down the aisle
Look at that cow in the field
It knows more than your bride knows now

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze

That the tide doesn't reach

Morrissey,"The joy brings many things
It cannot bring you joy
Sons of mothers huddle here
Men and boys

1850 swung the doors
And human sewage swept inside
Where victims speak in whines
And where the hardened cried

I was sent here by a three foot half-wit in a wig
I took his insults on the chin, and never did I flinch

A swagger hides the fear in here
By this rule we breathe
And there is no one on this earth
Who I’d feel sad to leave

You see we all lose
We all lose

What those in power do to you
Reminds us at a glance
How humans hate each others guts
And show it given the chance

We never say aloud the things
That we say in our prayers
'Cause no one cares

Many executed here
By the awful lawfully good
But the only thing that makes me cry
Is when I see the sky

Brendan Behan's laughter rings
For what he had or hadn't done
For he knew then as I know now
That for each and every one, of us
We all lose
Rich or poor
We all lose
Rich or poor, they all lose",Mountjoy

Doctor gave me asprin to ease the pain, 
Soon a blood test revealed the brutal force, 
I had been inflicted with the worst...luekaemia.
Chemotherapy began the process off, 
Powerful but destructive drugs infused into my blood.
The only way out, but hideous pain, 
Cry out to God in the night. 
He blesses his children with sleep. 
But little did I know that the real pain was coming.
What is known as a bone marrow transplant, 
Was my only chance they said.
Chemotherapy was just a 1% chance 
But if I could find a donor with identical stem cells,
I could have a 25-40% chance of cure, survival. 
78% of sufferers never find a donor but something
Interesting was there in my case....
God had given me my father's stem cells, 
Perfect for the transplant. 
God doesn't work by percentages. 
We trusted God with all our heart 
My dad had had skin cancer, 
Any remaining melanoma would surely have taken my life.
The immense suffering of a bone marrow transplant can
Not be put into words. 
As I lay in my living nightmare I cried out to God,
Who is always there. 
Two days had gone past the limit to produce the blood
For me to survive. 
Doctors with empty faces entered the room to share the
Devastating news. 
I needed a second transplant or I would surely die. 
We were told the second transplant usually didn't
Work, but was my only hope. 
We needed a miracle from God, we felt his power fill
The room. Peace overcame fear, as we gave up control
To the almighty. Ashtonishment, joy, and disbelief was
Felt by family, medical staff and doctors, were
Shocked with the realization that the original stem
Cells had begun to work. God performed a miracle and
The blood began it's count. Soon the graft had taken I
Was on the road home. As I was discharged we prayed
That all would work.
Weeks of pain followed as my body fought to live. The
Devastating pain was a real sick affair. I forced
Myself on walks and to eat each day, but the immense
Pain was more than I can say, was more than I can say.
As I struggled to live on and fight the sickness war
We were told by doctors that the cancer had returned.
Two weeks I was given but we had had enough. We were
Ready to hand all to God. No more treatment I annouced
To the cancer doctor. Standing there I was in God's
Hands then suddenly one day a double seizure struck me
Down. Family gathered round to see my final hours.
Countless damage had racked my body leaving me half
Dead. I couldn't walk, I couldn't see, my insides were
Badly hurt, it seemed it was the end for me. Warrior
Upon warrior around our distant globe kept the vigil
Fight of prayer of power that can't be stopped and as
The folks cried out to God, He heard them and I live
To stand for him. A lot more special days. God has
Given me peace and comfort all along. As I have cried
Out to HIs grace the joy is overwhelming. He has the
Power to heal, He has the power to save, as we trust
In his mercy we know that we are safe. I KNOW THAT I
AM HEALED!!!!!!!!",Triumph of Mercy

Liberal Mediocrity
Taking from The Word is a disgrace.
Politically Correct,
Tickle the ears and kill the faith.

[Chorus]
Rightly divide The Word of Truth,
Profit for doctrine and reproof,
Rightly divide The Word of Truth,
understand Scripture and it's use.

Liberal Mediocrity
Modernistic tainted by the world.
Politically Correct,
Open mind is poisoned to death.

The Lord is coming for a spotless church.
Repentant, forgiven.
Not deceived by words of man.

Lock up the night, release the fire,
Now show The Light, pray for morning,
Take out the dark, Spirit shine,
Glowing eyes, show the heart of life.

Take the day now for the Lord,
Chosen the way how to decide,
Run away to the skies,
Unseen power to receive.

Feel the pain now it appears,
Darkness hates how Jesus heals,
Fly away to Life,
Mighty Grace to be free.

Arrive now to Light,
Shining joy to reveal.

[Verse 1]
Small group in Cambodia, 
Gather in the mud brick room,
Teachers shares The Word, 
Then they kneed and pray,
Communist soldiers storm the door, 
Throw the Bible to the floor,
Spit upon this book 
Or you will breath your last
One by one they spit and cry
They're in fear of their lives
A young girl wipes her Jesus dry
Shot in the head she dies.

[Chorus repeat]
[Verse 2]
Evil man killing the Christians
Satan gives him the false abuse,
But as he reads The Bible truth,
He converts to the Christian Faith,
Taken to the evil leaders, he is a disgrace
Thrown into a slime filled pit,
Eaten by rats for his new Faith.

[Chorus repeat]
[Verse 3]
Preaching man in china,
Taken from his family home,
Thrown into a prison cell,
For no criminal reason,
Rotting and tortured in his fate,
He will not deny his Faith,
He knows the truth of Christian ways,
No brutal force will make him change.

Look at his face
What is the reason for this change
Revival in his heart
Causes havoc for the devil

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

If you can hear me ladies and gentlemen
Then I'm very happy that you came here

That was for Brooklyn
Ha ha, we get it everytime
You got me on? Ohh
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
It's a lot of things goin on y'all

20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that

""Yo Mos, what's gettin ready to happen with Hip-Hop?""
(Where do you think Hip-Hop is goin?)
I tell em, ""You know what's gonna happen with Hip-Hop?
Whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, Hip-Hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin alright, Hip-Hop is gonna be doin alright
People talk about Hip-Hop like it's some giant livin in the hillside
Comin down to visit the townspeople
We are Hip-Hop
Me, you, everybody, we are Hip-Hop
So Hip-Hop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where Hip-Hop is going
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?
'til you get a clear idea
So if Hip-Hop is about the people
And the Hip-Hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmmmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that, they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable cause they been created by God
And God, makes you valuable
And whether or not you, recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin to be God, wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the all-seeing eye
Eh I guess The Last Poets wasn't, too far off
When they said that certain people got a God Complex
I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that
Helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the
Satellite dishes they just, wishing
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to
Have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what I'm saying to you check it

All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here
On this place called Earth, holding down my square

'Bout to do it for y'all, and y'all at the fair
So just bounce, come on bounce
B-b-bounce b-bounce b-bounce-bounce
And just
Just step two three
Just step two three and
Step two
Two three and
One two three and four
One two three and four
Once again

All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here
On this place called Earth, holding down my square

Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
To your atmosphere, to your atmosphere
That was for you, and Brooklyn too!",Fear Not of Man
Mos Def,"Some cats really like to, you know
Profile and front
And then the jooks go down, all at once they like

Don't get me

You're out on the block hustling at the spot
GOT, this is how you get Got
At the gamblin' spot and your hand is mad hot
GOT, this is how you get Got
Out in Brooklyn late night flashing all of your rocks
GOT, this is how you get Got
Some girl from pink house said ""I like you a lot""
GOT, this is how you get Got

This one goes to all them Big Will cats
With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac
You goin' around town with your system bump
And your windows cracked low to profile and front
Now I like to have nice things just like you
But I'm from Brooklyn, certain shit you just don't do
Like, high postin' when you far from home
Or like, high postin' when you all alone
Now, this would seem to be clear common sense
But, cats be livin' off, sheer confidence
Like ""Fuck that, picture them tellin' me run that""
But acting invincible, just ain't sensible
It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle
5 star general, flashin' on your revenue
You takin' a ride on the Downstate medical, Like (whooooooo)
Colorful sparks, yellow and blue
A full on attack and it's happening to you
Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you, that equals Got to me

Don't get me

Come on ya'll now, let's be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed
I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem
They fiendin to be seen, get hemmed like Gabardines
Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin
They comin' down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position
To observe your trickin', then catch that ass slippin'
Like, come on now ock, what you expect?
Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'
They clique starts creepin' like Sandinista guerrillas
You screamin' playa haters, these niggas is playa killers
Mr. Fash-ion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your passengers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless

Don't get me",Got
Mos Def,"You say one for the treble, two for the time
Come on y'all let's rock this!
You say one for the treble, two for the time
Come on!

Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall,
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still
Committed to page, I write rhymes
Sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature, from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister
Subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
(Ha ha ha) From the core to the perimeter black,
You know the motto
Stay fluid even in staccato
(Mos Def) Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the trunk hollow
There's the hum, young man where you from
Brooklyn number one
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still try to follow where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies
Violently, silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the king's English
But caught a rash on my lips
So now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (switch)
Move like an apparition
Float to the ground with ammunition (chi-chi-chi-POW)
Move from the gate, voice cued on your tape
Putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate
Who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping
To Be-Bopping
To Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(where ya at) I'm high, low, east, west,
All over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock
The fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop
Then the phone calls,
Chill for a minute
Let's see who else tops
Snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself ock
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock)

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
The out of court settlement
Ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits
Luxury tenements choking the skyline
It's low life getting tree-top high
Here there's a back water remedy
Bitter intent to memory
A class E felony
Facing the death penalty
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with
on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness
Remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot
The working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box
Sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops
It's all city like phase two
Hip Hop will simply amaze you
Craze you, pay you
Do whatever you say do
But black, it can't save you",Hip Hop
Mos Def,"Hey, hey, hey man
I strike the empire back
I strike the empire back
Fuck the Empire!
High flying like the millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand?  Doing this for my family
Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy, who dreamed about being a big man
On small loose leaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but now a day it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back, that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seeking the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano
Kweli is you wit me? (What up what up?) Let's make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When y'all want to leave y'all?  Right away

Shout it out from East-West (from South to Northern)
From Cakalak' (to California)
From the coldest (to the warmest)
To the borders ('cross the waters) understand
""and know that I love you""
We got love in the place
Shout out to all the Queens (all the Seeds)
To all the teams (that's getting cream)
From outlaw (to emcee's)
Make it happen (do your thing) understand
""and know that I love you""
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen

Guess who?  The illest MC in the atmosphere, yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate
I give it up to God, all that, love and attachment, get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Y'all don't hear me though, even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me? I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat, and what I bleed
MC's imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off, you come across soft
Back in the days, niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guest list
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, MC's in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know it's only cause I love you

Shout it out from East-West (from South to Northern)
From the richest (to the poorest)
To the elders (in the coffins)
Living native (dying for it) understand
""and know that I love you""
Yea, yea, we got love in the place
Shout out from up top (to the middle)
To black bottom (sky high!)
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter, than July
It don't stop 'til we complete this
(and know that I love you) keep this fly
It's so much to life when you just
Stay black
My people, my people, my people people p-people
My People",Know That
Mos Def,"Ha ha
You know the deal
It's just me yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my peoples, Negros and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth coming live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posses extra strength
Power-lifting powerless up, out of this, towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom sing
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, ""You Are Not Alone""
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers ass
You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

Yo, it's one universal law but two sides to every story
Three strikes and you be in for life, manditory
Four MC's murdered in the last four years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the seven deadly thrills
Eight-year olds getting found with 9 mill's
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal
He on the hill puffin krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new ground to get cream
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
So front liners got they gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggas
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:
The million other straws underneath it, it's all mathematics

And check it out now
Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the high rise elevator
Other tenants who be praying they ain't the new neighbor
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with O's o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the O's on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase
Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case
You living large, your skin is dark they flash a light in your face

Now, who is cat dining out on the town
Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him, do you work here?
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga

Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks got it muffled across beneath they breathe
""I didn't say it""
But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she comes by walking past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
(Wow, Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!)
They stay on nigga patrol on american roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go as they please
But I go over seas and I get over-seized
London Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think the dark face is smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalysis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology and no regard
Even for the big american rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
""If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face""
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo

Now, who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the back to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga, Nigga

You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen, molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holding hands
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by a jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doing it, well, it's success
When I start doing, well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all living off of slave traders paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm putting up the big swing for my kids yo
Got my mom the fat water-front crib yo
I'm a get her them pretty bay windows
I'm a cop a nice home to provide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in

Come inland and make your house go ""Bye"" (My house!)
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead nigga
Now his belly full and he about to flood something
So I'ma throw a rope that ain't tied to nothing
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
It's the New World Water; and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it don't rain for four weeks some summers
And it's about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fucking bath
Heads is acting wild, sipping poor, puffin dank
Competing with the next man for higher playing rank
See I ain't got time try to be Big Hank,
Fuck a bank, I need a twenty-year water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweating they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops burning the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say, ""Don't drink the water! We need it for the fire!""
New York is drinking it (New World Water)
Now all of California is drinking it (New World Water)
Way up north and down south is drinking it (New World Water)
Used to have minerals and zinc in it (New World Water)
Now they say it got lead and stink in it (New World Water)
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam cross the sea
Man, you gotta cook with it, bathe and clean with it (That's right)
When it's hot, summertime you fiend for it (Let em know)
You gotta put it in the iron you steaming with (That's right)
It's what they dress wounds and treat diseases with (Shout it out)
The rich and poor, black and white got need for it (That's right)
And everybody in the world can agree with this (Let em know)
Consumption promotes health and easiness (That's right)
Go too long without it on this earth and you leaving it (Shout it out)
Americans wasting it on some leisure shit (Say word?)
And other nations be desperately seeking it (Let em know)
Bacteria washing up on they beaches (Say word?)
Don't drink the water, son they can't wash they feet with it (Let em know)
Young babies in perpetual neediness (Say word?)
Epidemics hopping up off the petri dish (Let em know)
Control centers try to play it all secretive (Say word?)
To avoid public panic and freakiness (Let em know)
There are places where TB is common as TV
Cause foreign-based companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five
Now the world is drinking it
Your moms, wife, and baby girl is drinking it
Up north and down south is drinking it
You should just have to go to your sink for it
The cash registers is going ""cha-chink!"" for it

Got the fish looking cockeyed
Used to be free now it cost you a fee

Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terror dome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Super heroes!
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six original sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnheart
Stay on the low like the earth spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, your hopefully
Mush off or you get bust off like a ovary

Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
In a rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour
Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Cause they speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding,
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding,
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding
Relax
Slow down, you better chill money
Lights be changing fast on these streets dude
Smash your whole shit up
You better cool out money
It ain't like that out here
Look at these cats man, it's funny man
He probably just got that car
About to fuck your whole shit up
Speed laws out here money

Sometimes,
Sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away [fly fly fly, like a dove]
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself [ow!]
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man
Going insane
Losing my brain
Trying to maintain
Doing my thing
Hey hey hey hey hey
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me
Where I am, to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
(Black people to be free, to be free)
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but

Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
(I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
My dreamers said shine your light on the world
(Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
Shine your light for the world to see
(Want black people)
My elders said shine your light on the world  (Hey hey)
Shine your light for the world to see

I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All my people to be free, to be free, to be free
Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free
Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free

That's all that matters to me

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what,
Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and get down
Gotta have what,
Love, peace and understanding
One God, one voice, one life
One man, gon' shine my light

Mos Def,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a younging, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up)
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ""sun"" to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ""coff guawinas"" in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ""yarda trenny"" Brown's Village
Parkside tenants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on taking it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",Brooklyn
Mos Def,"People climbed into the night like space suits
People stepped into the night like moon boots
Marching like moon troops
In their zoot colored zoot suits

People climbed into the night like cool wells
Shiny bottles in their hands
Drinking their new selves
They say it's their true selves

People climbed up in the night like green trees
They were hanging from the night like green leaves
Buzzing like queen bees

People climbed into the night like space suits
People stomped inside the night
Stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping

Where are they going?
What's the rush?
Everybody's embraced but so out of touch
Hey

Night-time is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
And you're frantic all by yourself

Night-time is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
Baby don't make no fast moves
Baby don't make no fast moves, Tonight

People stomped inside the night
Let me climb into the night
Let me climb",Climb
Mos Def,"[Chorus]
We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam
We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

I come up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one chase, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
...
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smile with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine

[Chorus]

Some people live out in-New York City
Some people live out in-Atlanta
Some people got to live-Chicago
Some people do live-Miami
All my people at-California
And other people got to live-London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me

When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chilling in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and things
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick 'em up, move 'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin'
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find
Block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine.

Mos Def,"I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish

My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you gotta pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent
Element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Ayo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face (close your eyes)
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise

My folks said they was in love when they made me

Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm

I be the ""Funky Drummer"" to soften the hard Earth

(Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene, and on out to Queens
Uptown To Booggiedown, yo just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 6-3 (right)
I'm reaching a height that you said cannot be
I'm bringing a light which you said we can't see
Saw the new day comin', it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning: bright, true and living
Ever changing was a state of magnificent
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Building the now for the promise of the infinite

Mos Def,"In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn
What's your name love, where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like, yo I'm leaving now
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around, say word
It was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling
Oh, I'm fine
My name is Mos
I'm Sharice
I heard so much good about you it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey-love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm about to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, how you gon' leave before you dance with me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like, some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you, besides
Can I have a dance ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered honey, let's exchange numbers
Scene three: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Issac
Like, if I don't, if I don't
Showing me that tan line and that tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ah damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Moon hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kitty club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Mos Def,"(Huh) my grandmomma was raised on a reservation

They sang, songs for relaxation
They sang, songs, to take their minds up off that

I am, yes I am, the descendant (yes yes)
Of those folks whose, backs got broke
Who, fell down inside the gun smoke
(black people!) chains on their ankles and feet
I am descendants, of the builders of your street
(Black people!) tenders to your cotton money
I am hip-hop
""It's heavy metal for the black people""

But that ain't the way I'm trying to move
I don't turn on korn to get it on;
I be playing jimi hendrix 'til the dawn
That's my word is bond
Sitting up on my front lawn
Got the volume turned to ten
Playing albert king the best again (black)
When the morning in the cooker
Got to turn on some john lee hooker
When I want some rock and roll
Go to otis redding to get some soul

Say, james brown got plenty of soul
James brown like to rock and roll
He can do all the shit fo' sho'
