Kreator,"Death to the world, man's necronomicon
Depopulation, Quetzalcoatls return
Sorrow and famine, afterbirth of sixth age
Facing the dawn of a seven year atrocious plague

Death to the world, no religion can save
Mankind from falling into bottomless graves
Chernobyl horror, oh the great burning light
Behold catastrophes as heaven and hell collide

Death to the world, death to the world
Reincarnate the gods that died to reign on Earth
Death to the world, death to the world
Embodiment of all demise, the whole human race shall die

Death to the world, oceans darker than black
Slaughtering creatures with no sense of regret
Their simulacrums and their temples of lust
Kings and peasants, by nature's hand they're crushed
Death to the world, death to the world
Reincarnate the gods that died to reign on Earth
Death to the world, death to the world
Embodiment of all demise, the whole human race shall die

Mother Earth, what have we done to you?
Mother Earth, why have we forsaken you?
Mother Earth, the paradise you gave
Mother Earth, all your beauty
We have raped

And if those who find shelter
Can only survive
Out of atoms and emptiness
From such foulness of root giving
Birth to the world
Gods to the world
Hate to the world
Wars to the world

Death to the world, death to the world
Reincarnate the gods that died to reign on Earth
Death to the world, death to the world
Embodiment of all demise, the whole human race shall die",Death to the World
Kreator,"They're marching, they're marching
They're marching into violence
They're killing, they're killing
They're killing for the tyrants

Forever born to kill, tools of warrior race
Bloodshed, torment everywhere
Collateral murder becomes their game

As the circle is closing
And the seeds have been sown
Words of glory unspoken
For the few, the proud, the broken

They're hateful, so hateful
A breed of liquidators
Psychotic, traumatic
When pride is all that matters
Their act of sworn allegiance
Is slaughter of the weak
I hear philippics of leaders echo
In a dying infant's scream

An assault to the senses
For this battle is real
Now the spirits of war are awoken
By the few, the proud and the broken

Nation after nation
Broke the pride of men
Indoctrinate the heritage of Cain
Mental devastation
All who will come back
Are turning into dehumanized wrecks
Dehumanized wrecks

All the corpses
All the pain
All the struggle was in vain
All the fury
A cause manmade
We mourn their lives as they fade

As the circle is closing
And the seeds have been sown
All the rage, all the rage
Warrior race

Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race
Forward march warrior race

Kreator,"I don't know who I should belong to
All I know is that I don't belong
So if you feel the same that I've always felt
Let's walk this path through flame and flood

Let us be a part of the cure
Never part of the plague
We'll only remembered for what we create

From flood into fire
One thousand voices sing
We're in this together
For whatever fate may bring

I don't know if I could trust you
All I know is that I cannot trust myself
Let's face our imperfections now to connect
Capitulation deserves no respect
Let us be a part of the cure
Never part of the plague
We'll only remembered for what we create

From flood into fire
One thousand voices sing
We're in this together
For whatever fate may bring

No fear of confrontation
And if the waters rise we'll see the cloudless skies
We have to make our choices now
These words that I now write might be all I leave behind

Muses of the lower world
Sing for pain I once endured
Mantic wisdom finding the
Mystery divine

From flood into fire
One thousand voices sing
We're in this together
For whatever fate may bring",From Flood Into Fire
Kreator,"Ascending from an enemy appears
Ending the ever forming bliss
Two appear, a horror in the wilds
A fear that concentrates upon the eyes
Force of total violence, total death
Lies, a pure feeling of the west
To start the calibration of the childs
The cancellation revelation's sluts

Phantom's calling, across the land
Leaving trails of blood and sand
And this torture, and misery
Souls are awake enough to see
Far beyond the lies

Phantom antichrist

Archers are the forever slain
The three became hopelessly enslaved
The inheritance of a thousand words
Four take the blessing of the sword
The traitors form, they will never yield
Pain becomes thunder, righteous leave
They are anxious for the fallen paradise
The kingdom of the phantom antichrist
Phantom's calling, across the land
Leaving trails of blood and sand
And this torture, and misery
Souls are awake enough to see
Far beyond the lies

Phantom antichrist
Phantom antichrist

Terror will prevail

Terror from the left, terror from the right
Oppression is the root to our great suicide
Overthrowing gods, overthrowing all
Exchanging of the stimulated mind contagion
Feeding off the woes, from human misery
Genocide, genocide, war doesn't cease
The shadow of his wings is falling on his limbs
Every other color, turning into black

Savior's calling, across the land
A new beginning, that has no end
An open mind of forceful will
Don't start laughing, feel the kill

Circle of all life

From our birth to our last breath
Don't drown in your memories
For now is your time

The faith of the earth rests on the shoulders of the fallen ones
Know however long the night the dawn will break
Passing the flame from one generation to the next that comes
Stay here, only the soul will remain, only the soul will remain

Forgotten will be our life's gain

Kreator,"You'll see us coming like a killer swarm
Hunting infidels erase their souls
Our viscious regiment cruel to the core
Brings liberating death unholy war
Army of storms no one will survive
Rising from the ruins of
A culture in decline
Scattered in thousands they will lay
A bourgeois decadance but without faith

For tornados and hurricanes
Will not hold us back
Ultra void as the ultimate deception
Ride the winds broken free
Now revolt and you will see
Nations and empires reborn
Beyond the blood red horizons you'll hear us

You'll see us coming with a newfound creed
Eternal doom a blessing for the meek
Army of storms darkness of deceit
Will crush the thrones of inhumanity

As we shed the blood of olympus
Hell below purgatorium above
And build a church for the rest of us

Kreator,"I can't believe this is happening to me
Like the ultimate lucid dream
From dust to dust, to where I belong
Into the void, I'm coming home

A disembodied voice, a whisper in my ear
""Tell me why, why are you here?""

As we sail across the river Styx
Into Elysium or into the dark abyss?
The dark abyss!

My body separating from my soul
First time I can see
For the first time I am whole
Brightness, like shiny chromium
As I leave - this pandemonium
No mourning for the one I left behind
The source of everything
No more space and time
A universe, yet for you to see
All is one, and all is you and me

This must be my destiny
Death becomes my light
The only true reality
Death becomes my light
And in fear devils take my life away
And in peace all the angels sing to me
""Let us free YOU from this earth""
Death becomes me
Death becomes my light

Noli timere messorem
The beginning existence without end
Looking down as I become the light
The ones that went, before me in my sight
In this bleak, faceless entity
Religions will be joined a shamanic odyssey
Extol into a higher atmosphere
All my doubts and worries disappear

This must be my destiny
Death becomes my light

All of the roles I have chosen to play
Now they mean nothing at all
All my celestial knowledge returns
Reviving as I leave the ground
The exhibit's open as I see my life
Pictures in ten golden frames
The end of the tunnel is leading a way
To where life and death are the same
I hear the voices surrounding my soul

Feeling the words they're repeating:
""You're not alone""
You're never alone

I hear the voices surrounding my eternal soul
Feeling the words they're repeating
""Your time has not come""
""Back to earth your time is yet to come""

I can't believe this is happening to me
Why have I returned to hate and tragedy?
Where confusion turns the world into hell
Back to famine, jealousy and greed
Tell me now, can no one see

Into the arms of the universe

World war now
World war now
One million hands turn into fists
Can't you feel the end is coming
World war now
World war now
Six billion souls at the abyss
This is world war now

See the pain, hear the cries
Seeds of hate, sowed by lies
Don't give in, tear them down
As the tyrants, scream it out
See the pain, feel the fear
Plants of hate, sieged frontier

[Verse 1: XL]
We're from the be	 to the O-S-T-O-N
Where cats double push friends for dollars and gems
Platinum artistes they don't want to come here (nah)
Not cause of lack of money or bitches, but out of fear
Rappers up here be gettin' overlooked for years
Started hatin' on eachother sabotagin' careers
Ten o' the best MC's we got to offer
To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggaz think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggaz and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Chorus: x 4 Guru]
I'ma get home, I'ma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-be	, fifteen years of are & be	 transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B.

It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggaz know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Common Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so

And make you something, get dough and break you something
Spend time, plus dine at the lake or something
Have sex foreplay, and watch a tape or something
Yeah baby, let's get it on, the wave is nothing
Wild style thug, still run with an eight
Got a chick now, gettin' it crunk fifth in the waist
And she dealin' with a cat like me exactly

With professional cheaters, who clutch chrome heaters
Under wife beaters, at Club Cheetah's, so nice to meet us

Love look fierce, three karats in their ears
Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candles
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals

But when I needed his love back his heart was cold

And he sold me and I bought it once again

Shot down, shot down by lady killer
I should have seen it coming from the start
Shot down, shot down by a lady killer
He took his aim and shot straight through my heart

And then it hit me, saw him for what he was
I had to cut him lose, think fast and that was that
And then I saw him, he asked me how I been
Started beggin', pleading, crying the whole routine

Fooled me, two times

Krept & Konan,"This is my story
This is my story

Came from radio, it was late
Left the car, went straight to my gate
Head straight
Didn't even look left
Got my key out, started hearing footsteps
Right over my shoulder
Had to act fast, I can hear them getting closer
Tryna' keep calm and put my key into the door
Thinking to myself if I don't make it then it's over
I don't know how I managed it
Ran into my mum's room panicking
Mum shouting at me ""Karl what's happening?""
Carl shouting at me ""Karl what's happening?""
How the hell did I get in this?
Tryna' hold the door but it's coming off the hinges
Somebody wake me from this dream now
Then I hear a gunshot and my mum scream out
Somebody come and save the day
Somebody take this pain away
How can I ask God for help now, when I ain't even prayed today?
Is this how my life ends? (Nowhere to run, no place to hide in)
Carl ran out of the room tryna' fight them
Two more gun shots, everything's silent
Mum ran downstairs, she's crying
And I can't move a muscle but I'm trying
Praying for an ambulance but I can't hear a siren
She said he's shot I hope she's lying
I hear her shouting out for help, I think he's dying
I'm thinking why him? Was it wrong place, wrong timing?
I see him at the bottom of the stairs
Mum shaking while the neighbors tryna' save him, heart racing,
Wishing I could disappear
And it shoulda been me but it's him lying there
And I know it isn't fair
I phone Skanks, phone Shook, my whole body's in shock,
I couldn't even shed a tear
Trapped in this nightmare, how did I get here?

This is my story
All the pain, all the things, falling on me
All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry
Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me
This is my story
This is my story

Woke up to a ping on my blackberry
It was a message from Kone saying ""somebody tried to kill me and got my family""
I rubbed my eyes, is this a dream or reality?
Kone said ""Krept who the fuck was this mad at me?""
God, how we gon' solve this catastrophe?
Then God gave us 'Otis' it was a blessing from him
Cos it stopped us from going getting reckless on him
Thinking to quit music
Thinking to go and do something stupid
Then things fell in place and started improving
That's why I say the music chose us, we didn't choose it
Bearing in mind Kone started from scratch
Feds took his house, money, clothes, he never had jack
Then I got a call from Vash
He told us the plan so we got up in the lab
Then things started to pick up even more
Skepta hollered at me, said that we should come on tour
Skepta don't even realize what he did for us
Well if you're listening, thank you for help fixing us
From the tour, all these shows start coming in
Back on our feet now the money started flooding in
Invested in clothes and money started doubling
Now so much for struggling
Watching Kones getting back up on his feet
Thinking ""how's he coping"", I couldn't if it was me
Now Play Dirty's on the up fucking up the streets
Everyday a new city that we reach
But even though we turned around a mess
I'm sitting in my yard thinking that I could be next
Thinking ""did I give anyone his address?""
That shit that happened to Kone still playing in my head
Thinking 'bout he day it happened, when I saw his mum
And she told me ""please look after my son""
Not a single tear on her face showing
Even though I know her heart's broken
Staying strong even though we're stressing
Cos she lost her husband and that being the second
That's why the music is a must to us
Kone he's going to make it up to her

This is my story
All the pain, all the things, falling on me
All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry
Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me
This is my story

More kissing and touching, less bitching and cussing
More Rihanna and Drake, less Beyonce and Jay, committing to nothing
I know that she want me staying committed
Afraid to admit it, pride in the way
And it's ripping her heart into pieces
I see it's the reason that she feel away when I kiss it
Then she start naming some bitches that she thinks I'm fucking
'Cause I like their Instagram pictures
But you ain't my missus yet you tell me I'm acting suspicious

Thinks I only wanna beat
Now you're going through my timeline
I know that you're preeing
But I just wanna focus
I don't wanna DM
You wanna go that way
I'm tryna go this way

You don't ever wanna talk
Always shouting down the phone

How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream

I saw a young G sitting on the wall
Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, ""If you get life you're a fool""
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, ""I'd rather do life, than have none at all""
He said, ""Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool""
He said ""Me, I slip once, then I'm through
You'd do the same if you was in my shoes""
I said, ""Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die
He said, ""Krept, I don't even like this stuff
But I'm in too deep, fam, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up""
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, ""Krept, what's good, how's the music?""
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail ""Brap, that's my niggas""
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious
Put your hands together and pray with us
Need to see my family more
So busy that they probably think that I don't love 'em
Probably telling people I forgot about my cousins
He's gone to Hollywood now, man so fuck him
Man I'm stuck

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things it's giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye

In New York I met my big sis for the first time (first time), imagine that
I'm 24, it's the first time she sees me
Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes
And said she wished that he still was alive (alive)
She said, your mum sent you Jamaica (Jamaica)
She told me you came back ill (back ill)
Yeah I know you ain't been back still
But you know your friend over there got killed (got killed, killed)
I know she always had love for me (love for me)
Then she said something that stuck with me (stuck with me)
""Dad said you gotta keep the music alive""
Then she gave the the look like it's up to me (up to me, up to me)
It hit me hard, didn't show it though
Thinking 'bout it on the plane, going home (going home)
Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down (let him down, let him down)
Before I stepped out the house
My niece said ""Make sure you come back again""
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them (on them, on them)
We spoke about everything (everything)
And how his wife's tryna take everything (everything, everything)
All the inheritance (inheritance)
All because he gave her a wedding ring
So God forgive me for the minor things
Cause you'll risk everything when you're tryna win
And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things

MOBOs, now the woman won't stop bragging
I know they hated that we're shining
But we don't tuck our chains unless we fighting

When you're always hearing no you start to doubt yourself
It's even harder when there ain't nobody round to help

Don't stamp me those bottles boy, it might fuckin' stack up

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

I kinda like what we got, don't wanna ruin that
Just for a title, why you pursuing that?

Whip's got a fresh plate, boy I'm dish washing
Young niggas doing well, man that shit ain't often
A black nigga that balled, man that shit ain't common
They thought I'd be a typical black nigga
Making notes out of keys like a bad singer
It could have ended in a grave, so I show my blessings
Or in the can, but that's so depressing
A few of your ratings are still overdue
You still don't hear us? Then we'll grow on you
'Cause we the ones they used to stereotype
Now they play us on radio, we the stereo type
Yeah, nothing better than a proud mum
How man rappers did we outrun?
Bet they didn't think a BET would be the outcome
Wiz Khalifa told us he wants to get on the album
Yeah, shit's so surreal
Labels in the States tryna close a deal
New kids on the block, we the new wave
This good music got me two chains
I say I'm blessed but they're saying that I'm lucky
Selling fast food, I could have ended up a junkie
Look at all the people that we won over
Sex on the couch thinking that I've come so far
Could have chose to sell the green in the blocks fam
And be a green icon, that's a Whatsapp
But nah, nigga I'm just tryna live
All these awards, all that's missing is a BRIT
(Let me, let me break it down)
Money, cars and fame, what you are, a name
People think, start to change
I can try hide it, try fight it
No point, things just aren't the same
The hood just ain't the same
Crime rise, gun wars, bang bang
Might run up on you real quick
Pull it out, won't get a second chance, this ain't a game
Been there, done that, wore the T-shirt
Got the marks, scars from the wars
Tryna gain a name, make a way
Take the game, then charge through the doors
I'ma keep going, keep flowing
Keep showing 'til my arse on the Forbes
From in the hood, little crooks, to Guinness Books
Please start the applause
Please clap for me
I'm the truth, I should work in a factory
MTV lists, number one, we had to be
A mortgage deposit is what they're taxing me
Yeah, I earned this living
Move like I'm Brazilian, German whipping
When it comes to winning awards, you're my son
Because that's over 7-1
It's more than money, this material goals
I'm aware it ain't about these clothes
And that's real, I just hope that you remember me
So I'ma get my foot in the door and leave a legacy

I remember sitting in my classroom
Listening to Wiley and Dizzee Rascal
Breaking all the class rules
Now we've got more trophies than Arsenal
About a thousand on the shoes
Mummy's birthday, I put her on a cruise
Tell me what I've gotta prove
My cousin phoned me, said she saw us on the news
I was really in the street, you can go and phone much
Squeezed the gun off in the car, nearly shot my own foot
Now I'm sitting here thinking 'bout plaques and a Grammy
From me and Bounce testing out the MAC in the alley
How me made it this far's still a mystery
Dropped the mixtape and made history
Tryna do way more than they expect
Heard the top gets lonely, thank God I got Krept
They say it's our time and I don't wanna be late
I think too much cause I just wanna be great
Girls in the hotel and they don't wanna behave (behave!)
What they gonna say?
First headline show sold out in a day
I pray the fame will never change us
Had the whole arena looking like Wrestlemania
Lights everywhere
This summer, yeah we've been on flights everywhere
Egypt to L.A
Then Amsterdam, smoking weed on the stage
All the things we had to overcome
So I treat every chance like it's my only one
So fuck the fake love and the pretenders
""Don't Waste My Time"" got on Eastenders
What can they tell me?
Everywhere I go they want a selfie
I guess that's how it is when you're popular
But watch your back cause snakes ain't only on the Nokia
Sug and Travs got daughter's now
And I'm doing all that shit we used to talk about
When I was young I always dreamed that I would be this
I wish my dad was alive so he could see this

Yeah, I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way so I can hear the beat play
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way just to hear the beat play
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way, long way",The Long Way Home

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

So, tell me what you're waiting for?

You need to come on home so I can hold you tight

Kris Adams,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

Kris Adams,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Kris Adams,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much in such a juvenile fancy

I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

Words fall through me and always fool me and I can't react

Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
You've made it now

Moods that take me and erase me and I'm painted black
You have suffered enough and warred with yourself

Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul

How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, you know

I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
And yo, I did some things, but that's the old me

And now you wanna give me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies

How could you be so Dr. Evil?

Why were you at 3 a.m. on the phone?

Why does she be so mad at me for?
Homey, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go

You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

I could just leave it wrong

I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
There is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue

Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free

If my memory was erased

I will still find you

And recognize the way you pull me into you

And just like a carousel, round and round you go,

Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love,
Then turn around and screen my calls?
Foot on the gas

Making up excuses why

Or after watching a girly movie
Or she just needs a hand to hold

Told myself each time he means it,
I happily play the fool.

I go changing my ways
And I wait till the moon is out

Before you figure out what I've gonna turned into

Just close your eyes and try to think it over
You realize I'm not the man you know, girl
I hypnotize ya, I paralyze ya
Go on and scream 'cause nobody's gonna find ya

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

I've been telling you to run away
But you say you're not scared
But when I break your heart some day
Girl you need to be prepared

So listen close I got a dirty little secret
The kind that takes away the air you try to breathe in
You won't believe it
Until you feel it
If your love is blind I guess that's why you didn't see it

You are my weakness and you get me every time

Tired of flipping through the channels on the TV
Nothing on could shake you out of my mind

Kris Barnes,"And it came to pass on a Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
Outside standing, a lonely boy-child
Cold and shivering in the night

On the street every window
Save but one was gleaming bright
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in, saw candlelight

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys
And ducks and geese and cherry pies
But through this window saw a gray-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese, some bread to share

His outstretched hands held the food
And they trembled, as the door it opened wide
Said he ""Would you share with me Christmas Dinner""
And gently she said, ""Come inside""

The gray-haired lady brought forth to the table
Some glasses to their last drop of wine
Said she ""Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas
And especially yours and mine

And it came to pass on that Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
That in that town, the happiest Christmas
Was shared by candlelight",Christmas Dinner
Kris Delmhorst,"Here in the dark, I won't even make a spark
You're the only one who's never seen
The way I can light up in shades of gold and green
I'm just a little firefly, I want to shine for you but I'm too shy
So when you come around I hide my light
But when you go away I shine for you all night

All night, all night, when I shine for you all night
All night, all night, when I shine for you

Out there in the sun, I'd open up for anyone
You're the only one who closes me
Because I want to be the brightest thing you've ever seen
I'm just a little dandelion, I want to blossom but I'm scared of trying
I hide my head when you come into the room
When you go away I come right into bloom
And I can't look down, because I'm way too high
I can't look up, into your eyes

Well I never was afraid to sing out loud
In front of anybody, any crowd
You make me lose my nerve
Feel like something more than I could ever deserve
I'm just a little hummingbird, I want to sing but I can't find the words
So when you come around I just go still
But after you move on, when I know you're gone
I sing for you the way I always will

I will, I will, the way I always will
I will, I will, the way I always will
I will, I will, the way I always will
The way I always will
You know I always will

Kris Delmhorst,"Babe, you always were a hurricane
The way that first you'd rage and then you'd rain
And all the calm there in your eye
Just felt like a lie, it always changed

You could see it coming on for miles
Ripping up the trees and fencepost stiles
The wind turns warm, the sky goes green
That's the wildest world I've ever seen

So blow me down, blow me down
And leave me lying in your wake
Lay me low, lay me low in your old way
Let it rain, let it fall, shake the pictures off the wall
And roar away, roar away, hurricane

I've always kept the company of clouds
I like my lightning bright, my thunder loud
I was never one for bluer skies
All that bright sun droning in my eyes

So blow me down, blow me down
And leave me lying in your wake
Lay me low, lay me low one more time
Let it rain, let it pour, spin me round a little more
And roar away, roar away, hurricane

But I'm holding out my tongue
For just a taste of rain, electricity
I want to feel that change washing over me

Kris Delmhorst,"Good Friday came early, some might say that's just as well
It?s a wrecking ball afternoon, leave everything where it fell
And the things that were said
Still ring in your head

you'd give anything to be wrong
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

Now it?s Somerville Avenue rain and the night?s coming down
And you're looking for someone to blame in an innocent town
On the road all alone
Getting further from home

Every step that you take feels so long
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

I remember the light in your eyes put the neon to shame
And the smoke hidden deep in your throat when you'd whisper my name
Oh, the road is so rough
It?s all been enough

I got no idea how we go on
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

Kris Kristofferson,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""

And kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didn't see
That police man said, ""Mister Cool, if you ain't drunk, then you're a 
fool.""
I said, ""If that's against the law, then tell me why I never saw
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as 
me?""
Well, that was when someone turned out the lights
And I wound up in jail to spend the night
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds.

And like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong
And I told that man I'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that 
old cell.
That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,
""If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""
I said, ""I knew there was something I liked about this town."" 
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down.

Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.

Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,

Preferring perfect strangers to the company of friends
Because strangers are so easily forgotten.

To face a lie and dare to try again, but there's nothing like a woman

Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died
Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife.

With the junkie and the juicehead who had problems of their own
Stuck with luck it kept me standin' just a step away from starvin'
And the talent that I swore I'd show before I'd go back home

Ninety days I looked the army makin' neither love nor money
And my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone
And the junkie placed an order with the prophet on the corner
And he told him of the soul that he'd been sellin' for a song

He said my future was my fortune but I let it slip away
Slowly smokin' myself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
Findin' out that crime ain't all there is that doesn't pay
And writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it? Who said it?

I can read my fortune in the bottom of a glass
And I can see it's time for me to make my last request
Won't you fill my grave with whiskey when I'm laid away to rest
So the boys can say I drank myself to dead

Well, I drank the whole thing over puttin' one and two together
And it added up to more of what I didn't want to be
I ain't blamin' Music City but it's only gonna see me
One more day and the wake up and the time it takes to leave

'Cause I got a dirty picture of what could have been my future
In a prophet pushin' day dreams on a corner for a fee
And the wino lookin' lonely at a bottle gettin' empty
And a hungry lookin' junkie huntin' tea in sympathy

And I bet that junkie's laughin' after the life he threw away
Slowly smokin' himself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
Pleadin' down the prophet to a price that he can pay
And writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it? Who said it?

And starin' into the future, findin' nothin' there at all

Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Kris Kristofferson,"I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loneliness and pain
Knowing no one, needin' someone bad as me

And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walkin' slowly how she'd never known a man
Livin' lonely in her cottage by the sea

When the mornin' came, her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping all the secrets she was keepin'
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind

In the mornin' as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leavin' nothin' but her silence next to me

And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walkin' slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearin' in the silence of the sea

And I sometimes hear the echoes of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find
'Cause the answer I was seekin' was the secrets she's still keepin'
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind

",Shadows of Her Mind [#][*]
Kris Kristofferson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning,
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast,
Wasn't bad so I had one more, for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet,
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair,
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs 
That I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first, and watched a small kid cussin' at a can 
That he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin'chickin
And it took me back to somethin' that I had lost somehow, 
Somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishin' Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy, 
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to a song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams 
Of yesterday

[Chorus] 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, make a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming do",Sunday Morning Coming Down
Kris Kristofferson,"A couple of years back I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio.  And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he had written, I saw that he was about a step away from dying, and I couldn't help but wonder why.  And the lines of this song occurred to me.  I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted, and he's got him a good woman.  And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped showed me how to beat the devil.

It was wintertime in Nashville
Down on Music City Row
And I was looking for a place
And to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whiskey
But my hunger needed beans
But it had been a month of paydays
Since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty
And a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually I'd guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling
And sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
And he turned and said,
Come up here, boy, and show us what you are
I said I'm dry, and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said,
It's a tough life, ain't it?
I just looked at him
He said, you ain't making any money, are you?
I said, you been reading my mail
He just smiled and said, let me see that guitar
I got something you ought to hear
And then he laid it on me

If you waste your time a talking 
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying
Who do you thinks gonna hear?
And if you should die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Who do you thinks gonna care?
There were other lonely singers
In a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
‘Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know

Well the old man was a stranger
But I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out
On the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me
But my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't want to join him
You gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil
But I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

And you still can hear me singing
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying
Praying someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Hoping someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer
And I'm bound to die the same
But I've gotta feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel
I won't ever die ashamed
‘Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know",To Beat the Devil
Kris Kristofferson,"The clubs are all closed and the ladies are leaving,
There's nobody nobody knows on the street;
A few stranded souls standing cold at the station,
An nowhere to go but to bed and to sleep.

Now that you're here, ain't you
Proud of your peers
And the long way you've come'

All alone, all the way

That you've thrown it away for a song'

Fair-weather friends that you no longer know;
You've still got the same lonely songs to remind you

Kris Kristofferson,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)
Kris Kristofferson,"See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down

He's a poet, he's a picker
He's a prophet, he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around
>from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
The goin' up was worth the comin' down

He's a poet, he's a picker
He's a prophet, he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.","The Pilgrim, Chapter 33"
Kris Kristofferson,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!

Lord, ain't it a shame
Grieving together
Sharing the blame.
But when she was dying
Lord, we let her down.
There's no use cryin'
It can't help her now.

The party's all over
Drink up and go home.
It's too late to love her
And leave her alone.

But he don't pray to be no Christian soldier anymore

And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone

And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms

Kris Kristofferson,"Little Jesse Younger was a well respected lad
Doing all he could to please his mommy and his dad
But he never planned to be the man
They said that he'd become
And somehow or another Jesse's little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son
Every day the neighbors say that it's a dirty shame
The way he spat upon his family and scandalized their name
And his parents never really ever said he'd been disowned
But somehow or another now his little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son
Oh, Jesse Younger you're a devil not a man
Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind?
You have selfishly refused to live your life the way they planned
And you've started going your own way and speaking your own mind.
Jesse Younger's parents wonder where it all went wrong
Now that Jesse's name has turned to ashes on their tongues
But he chose to starve asnd try to carve a future of his own
And he got his druthers because now his younger brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son.

And every cheap hotel,
Asking for my baby; they all knew her well.
Well, they said, ""She's out there working
For the wages of her sin,
And if you want to find your baby, Baby,
Look for Sugar Man.""

Well, tonight I found her
On the sorry side of town
Lying cold upon the bed
Where she had laid her body down.
I picked up the needle that had fallen from her hand
And stuck it through the money she had made for Sugar Man.

How he hated goin' home

Waitin' somewhere by the phone,

Lookin' lonesome and afraid,
At a city full of strangers,
And a cross He never made

And He's sadder than He's wiser,
And a longer way from home,
And He wonders why His Father,
Left Him bleeding and alone.

Daydreams are somebody's lies
Lies ain't no harder than telling the truth

Shedding his humble pretensions
One careful toke at a time
And wiping the mask off the man in the mirror
Who really was Billy the Kid
Smiling at somebody dying
For something that he never did

As soon as he sat down beside her
Shining like Saturday night
Shandy was his for the saving
Sweet as she looked in the light
And maybe they moved from the bar to the bedroom
Maybe just stood there instead

Dreaming of blood on the bed.

As you listen to your lies
Once again you realize
That she doesn't mean a thing to you at all

Kris Kristofferson,"Silver was a rounder with a wicked reputation
Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song

Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them
'Cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for Silver's flashing hands

Then, once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame

Because Hunger, is the surface of a darkened pool of sadness
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses
And Silver took it easy as the closing of a door

Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows
Following the line between her laughter and her lies

But Silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms

[Chorus]

Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise

Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find

And Silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day
And Silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away

Because Hunger, is the surface of a darkened pool of sadness
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul",Silver (The Hunger)

(Feeling love is feeling good

Yet I see,­ I see
Faces
Covered-up and empty-eyed
Empty spaces
Where there used to be a soul inside

Nothing and no-one ever gets to you
Seems the wind could blow right through you
Believing in gods that never knew you
I believe in love, I believe in love
I believe in feeling good, and that's feeling love

You got to hurry­ monkey do what monkey see
You're on a one-way street and you're speeding
Missing the signs you oughta be reading
Passing things you'll later be needing
I believe in love­ what?

I believe it - nobody sold me
Always knew it - nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love, I believe in love, I do
Yes, I believe in feeling good
And that's feeling love

That's enough for me, I won't be

Kris Kristofferson,"The black, black widow is sittin' in the middle of the web
It's the fly she seeks
You may be her lover but you never will recover
'Cause she ain't had a bite for weeks
You think your the same, 'cause you got the same name
But the widow has a mobile home
Remember what I told you, she got eight arms to hold you
And she's never gonna let your roam
She'll tuck in your head, then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack
So if you see a spider, don't you slide up beside her
Why'd you think the widow's wearin' black?
Queen bee, baby
Pray that you may be left on your own, uh huh
Nothin' she'll give you, gonna outlive you
But the queen bee's never gonna be alone
Long before Atlantis there has been a praying mantis
And you knows why he's on his knees
He may have religion but but he's just a sittin' pigeon
If a woman even stars to tease
He won't even quibble if she has a little nibble on his neck, what a way to go
And now you done and torn it!
You been messin' with a hornet
She's a blue-blood wasp, you know
And just as you do it
She'll inject yiu with a fluid that you ain't even got but none
You're the meat on the plate, not even first rate
She's gonna feed you to her seventh son
The queen bee's story, is the power and the glory
Of the women who have ruled alone
Little Nefertiti used to consummate a treaty
In the bad as much as on the throne
Everyone was urgin' Queen Elizabeth the virgin,
Just to try a man but she'd refuse.
Queen Isabella was the one who said
This fella named Columbus ought to take a cruise
Didn't Cleopatra try to gratify and satisfy
The men she held within the grasp?
The pyramids where shakin' from the peace that she was makin'
But she ended with a stupid asp
The queen bee, no way, and even tho' they think they're the kings
(escatological things)
Who are they foolin'? Playin' at rulin'
It's the queen behind the scene who pulls the strings
So, in conclusion, it's an optical illusion
If you think that we're the weaker race
Men got the muscle, but the ladies got the hustle
And the truth is staring in your face
The mother bear stalks, and the queen of the hawks
Is the one who brings home the bread.
The lion that is regal, and the bald headed eagle
Need a woman just to keep them fed
But come the evenin', we're like adam and his eve,
Inside the garden. hear the serpent's song?
It's so frustratin', when you're really into martin'
And there ain't a lovin' man around
Whoever wrote this story
Throw out the glory
Bring in the men (give me them an I'll swing)
Write me a sequel
Give me an equal
And I'll give that man
I'm gonna give that lovin' man
I said I'm gonna give that lovin' man
I'm gonna give that lovin' sting! Zap!",Queen Bee

Kris Kristofferson,"Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife
Fallin' ain't no fun when you're on the run honey we was running for our life
When Stagger Lee had drunk his fill of moonlight
He turned his burning eyes upon my soul
It's time my God to spend this night with someone else he said
Squeeze a little pleasure from the gold love and glory
We can take it easy when we're old
He said we'll take us into town lay our money down
I'll bring you to the sweetest thing that grows
Because the fairest ones in sight are bloomin' every night
At a tavern called the Sabre and the Rose
We swang into the saddle sick as breathing
And slapped 'em once for pleasure with the reins
The horses snorted frosty in the moonlight
Somethin' dark was singing in my veins older than the voices in my brain
He said this place you're gonna see is why they live and breathe
And sink down a little bit deeper everyday
And sometimes at night when the wind is running right
You can hear it suckin' thirty miles away
Then the light was crimson and I found her all naked and eternal and insane
Secred as the mysteries around her like a veil nothin' but her prison was profane
All we had in common was our chains
Oh burn it down boys burn it to the ground boys burn it on down
Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife
All there was she ran holdin' to my hand runnin' for the river and our life
Slidin' from the moonlight into shadows silent as the river as it flows
Swimmin' to the place they'll never find us all we left behind us was our clothes 
And the stories children sing about the Sabre and the Rose",Sabre and the Rose

They met along the highway to Aomeri where danger in the forest loomed
Shashiko dressed in silks and dreamed of heroes
She was carried in a hammock draped and veiled
Her father was a cruel and brutal warlord who fearful kept her in a shell
Seito he was but a lowly servant but his master knew him to be true and brave
When he happened on the scene of her education he sent her captors to their graves
Seito guarded Sashiko to her palace he had no thought of ransom to conceal
She took him in and washed his cuts and bruises and laid him softly down to sleep
When morning came she rose to tell her father
Of the stranger who had ruined the kidnap plot
But jealous and enraged her father seized him and chained him in the dungeon dark
Sashiko's tears flowed like the river Edo as she pleaded Seito's freedom face to floor
But the warlord turned his back and would not hear her

How will they make it all alone?

Kris Kristofferson,"She would meet me in the mornin' on my way down to the river,
Waiting patient by the China Berry tree;
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee,
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees.
I'd pay her no attention as she tagged along beside me,
Trying hard to copy everything I did;
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying:
""Look a-yonder; there goes Jody and the kid.""

After we grew older, we could still be seen together,
As we walked along the levee holding hands;
For as surely as the seasons, she was changin' to a woman,
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man.
And she often lay beside me, in the coolness of the evening,
'Til the morning sun was shining on my bed;
And at times, when she was sleeping,
I would smile when I'd remember,
How they used to call us ""Jody and the kid.""

Now, the world's a little older, and the years have changed the river,
'cause there's houses where they didn't used to be;
And on Sundays I go walking down the pathway to the levee,
With another little girl who follows me.
And it makes the old folks smile to see her tag along beside me,
Doing little things the way her Mamma did.
But it gets a little lonesome, when I hear somebody saying:

Kris Kristofferson,"I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern,
To buy me a bottle of beer.
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden,
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair.
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle,
For something un-foolish to say.
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows,
And smilingly stole her away.

I said: ""Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil.
""He's everything that I ain't.
""Hiding intentions of evil,
""Under the smile of a saint.
""All he's good for is getting in trouble,
""And shiftin' his share of the blame.
""And some people swear he's my double:
""And some even say we're the same.
""But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose,
""I'll only live 'til I die.
""We take our own chances and pay our own dues,
""The silver tongued devil and I.""

Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him,
She knew in her heart that he'd lied.
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her,
No matter how hard that she tried.
'Cause she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger,
Of somethin' that she's never known.
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger,
Who'll love her and leave her alone.

And you know, he's the devil.
He's everything that I ain't.
Hiding intentions of evil,
Under the smile of a saint.
All he's good for is getting in trouble,
And shiftin' his share of the blame.
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same.

With no way to hold my head

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt

And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs

With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

In the park I saw a daddy with a laughing little girl who he was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singing

And a funky bunch of friends
Reckon we'd just nail him up
If he came down again

'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Who they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

Eggheads cussing rednecks cussing
Hippies for their hair
Others laugh at straights who laugh at
Freaks who laugh at squares

Some folks hate the Whites
Who hate the Blacks who hate the Klan
Most of us hate anything that
We don't understand

'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Who they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

Kris Kristofferson,"There are shadows on the sidewalks
Of the city streets at night,
And the alleyways and ugly things
Are hidden from the light.
And somewhere, son, my baby's
Gonna sell her soul again,
For a custom tailored lady-killer
They call Sugar Man.

I searched the backstreet barrooms,
And every cheap hotel,
Asking for my baby; they all knew her well.
Well, they said, ""She's out there working
For the wages of her sin,
And if you want to find your baby, Baby,
Look for Sugar Man.""

Well, tonight I found her
On the sorry side of town
Lying cold upon the bed
Where she had laid her body down.
I picked up the needle that had fallen from her hand
And stuck it through the money she had made for Sugar Man.

There are shadows on the sidewalks
Of the city streets at night
And the alleyways and ugly things
Are hidden from the light.
But the sun's gonna shine tomorrow
On some dirty gargage cans,
And a custom tailored lady-killer
They called Sugar Man.",Sugar Man [Version]
Kris Kristofferson,"He's a giver, he'll give her
The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin her into the world she's been hungerin' for

'Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her 

He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
'Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I never
And damned if he won't do her wrong
'Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted

Kris Kross,"I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..
I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..

I went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP -  so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00
Jumped in the shower and I know I was late
Stepped out put on my jeans and my uni'
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED
I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS
Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool
Standin on my block like a fool
But (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone
(3) if I miss school this weekend I'll be at home
Can somebody come real fast to my rescue
I'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do

I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again

I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again

I was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down
Thinkin I could chill 'til the time came around
And I did - HE DID - but a little too long
Cause when I woke up yo the bus was gone
I almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door
And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore
On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up
I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck
Cause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted
Scuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted
And when I got to school it was the same old thing
Stepped in the class and the school bell rang
It was nothin I could do, I tried to explain
But the teacher treated me like I was playin a game
YOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win
I learned to never miss my bus again

I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again",I Missed the Bus
Kris Kross,"Hey yo, here's a real scoop, homie Loc
Them fools around my way gettin' high off gun smoke
And I ain't talkin' about the high like Indo
The kind of high that make you call your kinfolks

And tell Loc, Johnny's dead
A fourteen year old kid put a nine to his head
All because he wanted that gear he was sporting
Gimme that while you're at it, gimme them Jordans

Johnny tryin' to jet, homie wasn't hearing that
Johnny tryin' to run and got gatted in the back
Now tell me what happens to the way things used to be?
'Cause in this game, there'll be no future, G

When will all of y'all learn
That if you're playing with fire too long, you're bound to get burned
This ain't a small thing I'm addressing
It's a big thing, take it from the daddy as a lesson

Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a

It's a shame, the way this thing goes down
How one lay you down just to show he don't play around
He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
And wakes up involved in a child's gang banger

I'm talkin' about a tisket, a  tasket
Not knowing next day he'll be laying in the casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade they playin', the games ain't fun

Something like Pac-man
Same name but the game as you put it in the sack
And running to the next board
And gat down the fools standing in the way of the door

There's no board and no points
And in this game, then he saw Pac-man wants
The game that goes for always blowin'
Then you'll slip up and they'll smoke you

Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame

None of this exist with the word peace
(Brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, man, please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of 'Watch out quick, I send him to the sky'

There ain't nothing to be playin' with
So listen what I give and what I be sayin', kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
'Cause on my way to school, I'll be watching you

Big, big daddy in his caddy with all of his boys
It only had weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part has havin' hard
But when you get count, you know how to restart

You gotta know how to watch your back
'Cause if you're slack, huh, you're going in the sack
I advise y'all all watch out or the game
'Cause the game ain't nothin' but a

I was at this club, this place called Roy's
I snuck in past my curfew trying hang with the big boys
There were hands swingin', people singin' and others on the wall
Disco lights blinkin' and people big and small

Security finally caught me, talkin' 'bout ""Son you're kinda young""
I said, ""Beat this Mr. Officer I'm just trying to have some fun""
Now on my way out, this girl said, ""Whuddup shorty?""
I broke away from the officer and then said, ""Girl, it's time to party""
You know

Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party

Next I went to a club to see what he said I was missin'
Snuck through the back door, it was like ""Yeah, I can get with this""
A whole bunch of cuties surrounded by a bunch of moles
With dreadlocks, bell bottoms and a couple wearing Afros

Now I was Krossed Out, totally fly to the T
Getting all the girlies then I got caught by security
He grabbed me up and said, ""Yo, I just kicked out your friend
And I don't want to see you and him around here ever again trying out""

Totally Krossed Out, into more Krossed Out leather

We were lookin' diggy diggy doe ready to rock
You know?

Oh, the back door shouldn't have be locked

Of ways of getting in,

Kris Kross,"The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind

Kris Kross,"Now I'm known to rock a party, and turn a party out (ho!)
A nappy headed little nigga representin' for the South
When I bust, and I do frequently
I see niggas in careers trying to get with me
Now no longer am I small
See got me a ballme of women, huh I keep 'em wall to wall
See cause mackin' ain't easy (easy)
But I had to do it, get into it, and plus they love to please me
Over age, never under
Wonder in the words of Aaliyah, Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number
So I takes 'em, shakes 'em, show 'em the ropes
Let 'em get a little taste and then they never let go
They say (Daddy Daddy), they call me, it gets major
Surprise visits and blowin' up my pager
Asking for favors that I don't do
That's for a nigga in love, all I'm doing is mackin' you

Mackin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it (do it)
Mackin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it (do it, do it, do it)
Now tell me whose the mack, tell me whose the mack

Mackin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it (do it)
Mackin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it (do it, do it, do it)
Now tell me whose the mack

Now I ain't got no big hat or a Caddilac
I push a drop-top Benz and a baseball cap (say what?)
I, keep the pad full of women, bad bodies in bikinis on deck
For when I wanna get wet
I tell Chris all the time I more of a mack than he is
And it's been this way since we was real little kids
I, got women saying 'baby tie me up'
I got 'em going to mall, shop and buying me stuff
Now with me it's like the old days ain't gone no where
A light skin-ded nigga with real long hair
Perm, corn rowed, individuals, afros
No matter what, I'm fresh head to toe
So who's the mack?, daddy mack
Seeing all the women in my stable watch my back
From these, player haters trying to salt my game
And snatch my hoes, it ain't a possible thing

You know what I mean?, ain't no need to bullshit
These niggas in love, You know what I mean?
Talking about how fast
There ain't no players, I'm drunk now, You know what I mean?
I'm kinda, (I know, I know), but I'm cool (I know)....
(The rest is unintelligeble to me)
You what I mean?

Now tell me who's the mack

Mr. Black, and we can do whatever
Flossin' in the Benz, decked out in the leather
Never slippin', just sippin' on this champagne
And I'll be spittin' pure game to this pretty young thing
My aim, to control
Mind, body and soul
Have her on the stroll bringing me the flow
Pimp stylin', stay smilin', profilin'
Presidential suite, gang of hoes sippin' Crystal-in'
Yeah we puffing real La
Laid back to the funk flows I prescribed
I could write a thesis on the dime pieces
Gotcha on her, didn't flaunt, when I grab your nieces
Mack daddy forte, when I'm flossin with the double K
Got all these broads showing us where they stay
Pager blowin up all these hoes wanna skeez me

Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

It's Monday night and I'm out
Chillin' with my girl, top down
500 SL pumpin' some sounds
Now me I'm in Versace from my head to toe
Lookin' for a place to go
So I can spend my dough
I found a spot, jumped out
My girl was hot, no doubt
And that was all I heard these bustas talkin' about
Now I ain't payin' no attention to this high school skit
And I ain't even tryin' to fight over this here dip
I kept walkin', but all they did was follow
Tryin' to flex
Talkin' about ym girls titties
And the jewels around my neck
Now I can feel a confrontation bout to jump on off
And I can see these little bustas
Tryin' to play me for soft
I heard ""stick up, stick up, get down and don't look up
Nigga give me all your money and your jewels cause you're stuck""
I said ""What?"" Fightin' back hit my mind
But it's a waste of time cause I ain't got my nine
And these...

Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

Now I done did all this work
So I can be the man
Fresh to def, twenty grand in a black sedan
Not knowin' I done had some homies watchin'
Steady clockin', plottin' to put da drop on me
Cause I'm flossin', hit the streets left and right
Sittin' swoll, lookin' for me a party that's tight
I heard somebody yell ""112"" that's the spot
So I hit the parking lot
Not thinkin' of gettin' got
Cause it's mack, players, pimps, and dips everywhere
But niggas don't know how to act and they don't care
I heard ""freeze"" from these four niggas
That I knew, that I knew from back in grade school
I said ""What's up?""
He said ""What's up?"" It's on
Give it all up and then he showed me his chrome
I said ""Homes, you ain't even gots to trip
Cause I ain't even tryin' to die over materialistics""

Que humadera que nos viente ahogando
la gente se pregunta nadie sabe qué es
Un carra viejo que viene pitando
con llantas de triciclo y el motor al revés

En la esquina yo esperando
Como siempre su novia fiel
Mis amigas se están burlando
Murmuran cosas de él

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito

Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carra viejo
Me saca como reina
Un hombre de verdad

Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel
