Natalie Cole,"We used to be so very happy and we used to have so much fun
And we used to spend our time together, we were as close as anyone
I used to feel your every feeling, I was a part of your every dream

I'm not saying that you've thrown me aside, but oh that's just the way that it seems
So if Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,
Wanna say I'm sorry, darling, I'm so sorry
And if I said anything that I shouldn't have said, I'm sorry, sorry, yeah
Now were just getting used to a brand new situation

And I found out that temptation just wont let ya do good
So we must sit down and talk and be for real to each other
Cause I don't want my love for you to be misunderstood
If Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,
I'm sorry, oh baby, I'm so sorry, if I said anything that I shouldn't have said

(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh lordy I'm so sorry
(sorry) sorry, sorry, hey (sorry), if Ive (if Ive done anything) done anything
I (that I shouldn't have done) shouldn't have done

(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry, (if I said anything) if I, if I said anything I
(that I shouldn't have said) shouldn't have said well I'm so
(I'm sorry) sorry, sorry, sorry, (if Ive done anything)
I'm really, really sorry, baby, (that I shouldn't have done)

Ooh baby, I'm (I'm sorry) sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm (if I said anything) sorry, I'm sorry
(that I shouldn't have said) I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, really sorry
I'm so sorry, yeah, sorry, I'm so sorry, sorry",Sorry
Natalie Cole,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me

Natalie Cole,"Beautiful dreamer, you are like magic to me
'Cause you share all your love
And your life and your love is so fine in my life
It's just what I've been looking for
Searching for and you care
Beautiful dreamer, not an illusion to me
You know I can tell by the way that you've taken my hand
In a moment of sadness your gladness is there to surround me
Astound me and you care

I've seen all the people (waiting at the station)
Waiting at the station
(No imagination) no imagination
They're too busy doing nothing
Making all kinds of arrangements
(Nothing's really) but nothing's really changing them
(Changing them)

They're (they're) still asking why (why) their well is dry
I tried to tell them that love is the answer
They need a beautiful dreamer
If I could I'd share you with them
Oh, but you know it took so very long to find what I've needed
And my greatest obsession is doing my best
Just to keep you and love you 'cause you care

You're one in a million
(Always giving into) always giving into
(Me whenever I begin to) me whenever I begin to act
A little like I'm crazy
Still (still you never faulter) you never faulter
(Never try to alter) or never try to alter my integrity
How I could I not be proud to have your wisdom
You're such a beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)

You are like magic to me
'Cause you share all your love
And your life (and your life)
And your love is so fine

Looking for and you care

Natalie Cole,"Everyday the population is growing 
And to find some peace of mind is something rare
Don't you get discouraged, keep on going 
And don't you mind the way that the people turn and stare
Now how long can you keep on feeling guilty 
And tell me why should you feel bad about feeling good
Don't you know that the world is cold and filthy, 
Aw yes it is, but if you're a special child

They know sometimes you'll be misunderstood, (you can never look back)
Yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back) 
Your tomorrow is here today
Keep on fighting, a quitter never wins, 
Hold your breath stick out your chin
Count to ten, start again,
 
Everybody wants to be somebody
But they can't seem to see the forest for the trees, 
We just can't let our past hold back our future, oh, no, no, 
When its all over but the shouting
Nothing is left but memories, 
Looks like you could use a little bit of happiness
Now I know that its really hard to find, 
But you owe it to yourself to have the very best

And only a fool will try to catch up to what he has left behind, (you can never look back)
No, no, 'cause yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back) 
Your tomorrow is here today

And when you're crying, you need someone to hold on to
It's not the end of the world my friend, tip your hat, start again
And keep a positive direction, oh, 
Keep your vision straight ahead

You can't lose with the stuff you use, 
We've come too far just to turn around, oh, oh,
Don't you look back, yesterday is dead and gone (don't you look back)
Your tomorrow is on the way and if you're fighting people, a quitter never wins

Hold your breath, stick out your chin, 
Count to ten, start again, don't you look back
No, no, uh, oh, (don't look back) 
No 'cause we've come much too far
Just to turn around, uh, oh, oh, (repeat don't you look back) 
Don't you look back now
Yesterday is dead and gone, don't you look back, 
Your tomorrow is here today

And when you're crying, 'cause all your friends have forsaken you
Its not the end of the world my friend, 
Just tip your hat start again
Keep on steppin' y'all, don't look back, 
Don't turn your head around
Get up, get out on the good foot, 
Keep on fightin,' yeah, hold your breath

Natalie Cole,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars
Natalie Cole,"Hmm...., well, well, well, well, well
The mailman smiled as he handed me the news, tell you chil'

(Honey, I won't deny you) you took care of me, I'll take of you
(Doot, doot, doo, doo, doo) Now when I'm down (repeat Doo, doo)
You make me feel better, and your love for me really keeps me together
Come rain or shine, night or day, whenever you call me it'll be okay
If you want to stop by 'cause you're in the neighborhood
Or if you want me to make you feel real good (repeat Honey I won't deny you)
Oh, no (I won't deny you) that's one thing I'll never do to you
You took care of me, I'll take care of you (doot, doot, doo, doo, doo)
You know my body hungers for you and I know that's right
And when I can't get it, I get so uptight, here by my side
Is where you aught to be if you bring your lovin' home to me

Natalie Cole,"Every captain must steer the wheel, Not by choice but from the voice 
That's in his ear, I have lived long and I've done much wrong
But I've survived through my lies, I'm still here, so all you people 
Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on
Yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me
Well I felt fire and I got tired of running from the truth
And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool
So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you
I have lived on, yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me
There were times I had enough, I almost gave it up
But you reached out your heart to me, look what you've done now
I've become the best, oh, I'm the best I can be, oh, oh, oh
You've returned your love, the gift of love, yes, you gave this gift to me",The Gift
Natalie Cole,"I walked away from you once before
I still see you standing at the door
Trying to find the strength to say goodbye to you
Maybe we were wrong, gotta find what's right for me

Oh yes, we were brave to go our separate ways
But these days I wonder who's gonna [Incomprehensible]

I am nobody?s soldier
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart
I am nobody?s soldier
When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier

Life itself is war enough
I can't win for you, you can't lose for me
(I can't win for you, you can't lose for me)
Broken hearts and dreams we left along the way
Will only give us strength to fight another day

Maybe I just live too hard and love too much
But fighting, win or lose

I?ll be nobody?s soldier
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart
(A lonely heart)
I am nobody?s soldier
When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier

Where do we begin to learn to live again?
Find a place for me and one day we?ll be free

When lovers part they leave their broken dreams behind
And their wounded heart to heal

Still I am nobody?s soldier
(Nobody?s soldier)
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart
(A lonely heart)
I am nobody?s soldier

When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier

Though I think I really know you

And you think you know me

And we're as close at two people

Could ever hope to be

Still I can't escape the feeling

That no matter what I do

I'll never understand what it feels like to be you

I get the urge to know you better

To make our spirits one

I want to see us be together

As close as we can come

I get the urge to merge

I get the urge to merge with you

I get the urge to merge

I get the urge to merge with you

Have you ever wanted something

You just had to possess

And it turned into obsession

And wouldn't let you rest

There are times I can't help wishing

I could melt right into you

Hear every word you're thinking

Feel everything you do

I feel trapped inside my body

And there's nothing I can do

Want to leap across the wall

That's keeping me from you

To break what can't be broken

To say what can't be spoken

If only for a moment

To touch your soul

I get the urge to know you better




",The Urge to Merge

Is give you all I have and be right here with you

Something I don't want to lose

What I must do to hold you in my hands

I just hide it away

Don't want to remember what brings me pain

Who does it hurt if I'm masquerading

When anybody asks me you know I'll say, yeah

That I love him, he loves me

We're so good together

I'll pretend he's home again

Though he's gone forever

Don't mention my heartache

'cause I don't want nobody to know, no, no, no

Just keep it a secret that he let me go

'cause I don't want nobody to know

That I go through the motions (motions)

Put a smile on my face, yes, I do

I heard that the weather is changing today, yeah, yeah

And I don't talk about my business to no one

If anybody asks me you know what I'll say, yeah

Let me look at you, just look at you

You're a sight for sore eyes, yes you are

If you knew how many nights I spent holding you so tight

Then I'd wake up and we're still apart

Now you're really near and I'm really here

And I can wrap my arms around you, yes I can

This is just like I remember, no I think it's even better

Maybe even more than I can stand

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Honey, it's good to be back with you, oh yeah

Well it's not the first time we've been apart

But as far as I'm concerned it's the last

I don't care what we have to do to stay together from now on

But those days away from you are past

'cause when I go through the day and I haven't seen your face

Seems like nothing that I do feels right

You're the one I wanna see when I wake up every day

You're the one I wanna kiss goodnight

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again (ooh)

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Honey, it's good to be back with you

So good, so good, so good, so good, so good with you, baby

So good with you

Why don't you start me up with just one kiss

That's just one of the things I've missed

You better kiss me once again 'til it finally settles in

Well, I think I could get used to this

Baby, it's good to be back, so good, so good to be back, real good

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again, I just got to say it

Good to be back, so good to be back

Honey, it's good to be back with you

Baby, it's good to be back, feels mighty good to be back

Baby, it's good to be back with you

Baby, it's good to be back, so good, so good to be back

To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.

Stifling those who strive.

And there I'll be, while I rot

Natalie Cole,"NATALIE COLE - Unforgattable - Non Dimenticar

Non Dimenticar,
Means don't forget you are, my darling
Don't forget to be - all you mean to me

Non Dimenticar,
My love is like a star, my darling
Shining bright and clear
Just because you're here

please do not forget
That our lips have meant
And I've held you tightly

Was it dreams ago, my heart felt this glow?
Or only just tonight, dear?

Non Dimenticar,
Although you travel far, my darling
It's my heart you owe
So I'll wait alone, Non Dimenticar...

Se ci separò, se ci allontanò
L'ala del destino
Non ne ho colpa, no, e mi sentiro sempre a te vicino

Non dimenticar although you travel far, my darling
It's my heart you own, so I'll wait alone
Non dimenticar

Natalie Cole,"Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
For you 

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear maybe ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile- what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just smile
Oh that's the time you must keep on trying

Smile what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just smile",Smile
Natalie Cole,"(If I had to choose just one day)
If I had to choose just one day
To last my whole life through
It would surely be that Sunday
The day that I met you

Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-coming in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
Nodding all together, I can almost hear them whisper

Go on kiss him, go on and kiss him

If I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me
That way, that Sunday, that summer

Go on kiss him, go on and kiss him

And if I had to choose just one moment
To live within my heart
It would surely be that moment
Recalling how we started
Darling it would be when you smiled at me

Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand?

Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do

It seems I met ya, when my love had gone away
I start each day out just by saying to you

Stop haunting me now, can't shake you no how
Why don't you just leave me alone

Those straight through Sunday blues

Drivers show about love that it's hard on the curves

So I bring you a song for Christmas
May love be with us in our hearts 
And may joy and true happiness take part 


Christmas ? sometimes I wonder what it?s all about
And though I?ve had my doubts
Maybe that ray of hope can come shinin? through
And this old world can be a better place for me and you

(Chorus)
So I bring you a song for Christmas
May love be with us in our hearts 
And may joy and true happiness take part
",A Song for Christmas
Natalie Cole,"I go through the strangest kind of changes
Tryin' to find myself a way to pay my dues
And would you believe it I'm so urban
My suburban friends don't know my bag of blues
I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

Walkin' in a daze to my apartment where I'll grab another wink
And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news
But now in the meantime I'll just sit right here and cool it
We're gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm
Ahmad's blues",Ahmad's Blues
Natalie Cole,"Sky so vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know

Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling Stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and me

Oh Dindi, if I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me, oh, my Dindi

Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing Dindi
Happy Dindi when you're with me

I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do
I'd let you go away if you take me with you

Don't you know, my Dindi?
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my Dindi

I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do

Natalie Cole,"There goes my young intended
The thing has ended, regrets are vain
I'll never find another half so sweet
And we'll never meet again
I got impatient, told him goodbye
Sad eyes out in the rain

He was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close he stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
He would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was his fun

When I was mean to him
He'd never say go away now
I was a queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue
He was too good to be true",He Was Too Good to Me
Natalie Cole,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Natalie Cole,"There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face that music and dance
Soon we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune

And then 
There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance

Natalie Cole,"Like a lover, the morning sun slowly rises and kisses you awake
Your smile is soft and drowsy as you let it play upon your face
Oh how I dream I might be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover the river wind,
Sighs and ripples it's fingers through your hair
Upon your cheek it lingers, never have I known a sweeter place
Oh how I dream I might be like the river wind to you

Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips
Let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you

Like a lover the velvet moon shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
It's light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in it's embrace

Natalie Cole,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

So to whom it may concern
You've learned that heartache has no pride

Brought the sun and the flowers

Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear

There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss

Find romance on your menu

Went to Vienna but I found you there, too
Even in Switzerland, your memory came through
Where can I go without you?

I wanted travel, I wanted romance
I chased that rainbow across the sea
I'm tired of faces and quaint old places
If you can't be there with me

Back on the boat again and farewell to France
Farewell to London town they haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen for just one loving glance

Is all my time together
Take the rugged sunny days
The warm and rocky weather 
Take the roads that I have walked along
Looking for tomorrows time
Piece of mind

As my life spills into yours
Changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time
Turning time to flowers
I can show you all the songs 
That I never sang to one man before

We have seen a million stones
Lying by the water 
You have climbed the hills with me
To the mountain shelter
Taking off the days 
One by one
Setting them to breathe
In the sun

Take the lilies and the lace
From the days of childhood
All the willow winding paths

Till the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over
Till the Mojave Red turns into blue
When my lungs get tired of breathing 
And my heart stops its beating
Then I'll stop loving you

And if the dark, when there's no one calling out your name
Well I'll hold you so tight 
And I'll whisper to you once again and again

When the Mojave Red turns into blue
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless start praying

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Natalie Cole,"Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies

Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for our world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called?
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

There'd be no more lives torn apart
And wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

This is my grown-up Christmas wish
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown-up Christmas list

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.","Sleigh Ride, popular song (with lyrics by Mitchell Parrish)"

There was something that I never knew

I had an angel on my shoulder
With a plan for me divine
Must be an angel on my shoulder

But my broken heart just never knew

I had an angel on my shoulder
With a plan for me divine
Got to be an angel on my shoulder

With an unchanging love
I finally found a hand to hold on to
A shelter to run to, now I see 
He's watching over me

It's a good thing, or it's bad
But beautiful...
Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinkin'
I wouldn't mind at all...
Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful...
And I'm thinkin' if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be just beautiful I know
Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinkin'
I wouldn't mind at all...
Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful...
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I would never let you go!
And that would be so beautiful...
Yes, that would be but beautiful...

My dreamy friend
It's coffee time
Let's sing
This silly
Little rhyme

We'll celebrate
For just a dime

From their vast mysterious sky?

Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay

The friends we used to know
Would always smile ""hello""
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers

But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm

We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm recitin' a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home

She's afraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again

Spinning 'round

In a glass of champagne

You go to my head

Of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find
The very mention of you
Like the kicker
In a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might
Give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself
""Get a hold of yourself""
""Can't you see
That it never can be?""

You go to my head

My temperature rise
Like a summer

Natalie Cole,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

""Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""

""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.""
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas
Natalie Cole,"In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan, 
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; 
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, 
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; 
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign. 
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed 
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ. 

Angels and archangels may have gathered there, 
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; 
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss, 
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss. 

What can I give him, poor as I am? 
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; 
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part; 
Yet what I can I give him, give my heart.",In the Bleak Midwinter

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Natalie Duncan,"My head is in a black frame
Got your words all over my grave
He was a picture like no one would believe.
With a hit flask and a white mask, 
A flame head and an empty bed, I
Walked a mile out of town just to see.
Gravel 'neath the portrait, 
Your paint covering up the crack, so cracked up
If your coming back to visit me.
He was the wealthiest poor man
And he was the emptiest tunnel, 
'Neath the dark, darkest river to the sea.

You were my black thorn.
Underneath my ground and now my, 
My shaking hands forever bleed.
Forever bleed.
Forever bleed.

With a flat hat and a sharpened
Nose a body that crumbled under
The cold and the wind and hail
And rain of our bitter streets.
He called me sweetheart, 
I sold him my soul in return
For his charm and he used
My pain to suck my blood, 
To suck my blood.
He came back twice and
I wore him like an old shirt.
Wrapped me up and cut up my
Skin and made me weep, weep, weep weep.
Oh, my head is in a black frame, 
Got your words branded on my brain
I went insane so he could feel like a man again.

You were my black thorn.
Underneath my ground and now, 
My shaking hands forever bleed.
Forever bleed.
Forever bleed.

And, 

You were my black thorn.
Underneath my ground and now, 
My shaking hands forever bleed.

Oh and I say it to you, 
You were my black thorn.
Underneath my ground and now, 
My shaking hands forever bleed.

When it's slightly misty
And no one can run, 
'Cause they spent all of
Their money on alcohol 'n junk.
Like you did, little man sat in the corner, 
Waiting for an epiphany of some sort, 
As you spit and babble it all away to Jesus, 
Or some other spirit floating in your smoke.

You know you're gonna die pretty soon now, 
But you keep on smiling at your thoughts
And your leftover loose pennies
That you can just about clutch in those dirty, 
Curled up claws still carefully counted, 
They only amount to three more sips of ale
Before I saw water well up in your eyes, 
You told the same story to me.

And I think you may be the reason
For me to recreate my soul.

Become more than to be sitting
Right there by, that empty glass
You have left me.

It was all so much better back in your day, 
It was all so romantic back where you lived.
In the bedsit you grew marijuana
And took pride in your record player.
I sit dreaming of you as a young man, 
Before the smoke and liquor turned you grey, 
Before you all looked exactly the same to me, 
I see myself looking through a dusty mirror at me
After my babies, after my husbands, 
After I lose my loved ones.
When I grow into a different person, 
Yes I'm gonna write every single one of your words, 
I'll write every single one of your words, 
I'll write every single one of your words.
I'll write. I'll write...

Natalie Duncan,"She sucks in salty water
And sniffles down her hurt
And guzzles on the disassociation
In her thinning blood.
We drank wine for breakfast
Sitting by side in our dressing gowns
And waited for the sundown
To embrace the blue lit town.
She became my black leach, 
Sucking all my energy.
She stole all my money
And hundreds of pounds of the youth in me
And with red lips, that sucked many other dicks.
She got 24 years of pseudonyms
Resting on every one of her limbs
And I loved her once but she died.

For pissing on her doorstep.

And make you sleep in my bed and
F*** your mind instead, 'cause
I'm mentally distressed and
A sociopathic mess, 
I'm chugging these little brown cigarettes,

I'll cut out your heart
And eat it with your pride'

Narcissistic mirrors on a self inflicted sinner.

I was soft and low and weak.

With a naive flock of sheep to freak, 
She got a rotten shell of crystal chic, 
She got articulate tongues to speak, 
So split like a python snakes',

To blend with the leather skin I wear
That masks the tar covered streets.

Where do they all go?
Winding like ribbon silk
That old tarmac tapestry, 
That covers every one of our sins.
And I walked a long way home, 
Left behind a faded smile.
And walked right into the emptiness of my home, 
It covered up my cheeks.
And I sat in silence, 
Conversations in my ears.
I'm looking back on the happy returns
Of my birthday card years.

Hold out your hands together.
I don't need you here forever.
Just someone right now
To hold me 'cause I'm broken.
Then you can go and leave me, 
In uncomfortable silence.

Wearing out my shoes, treading over diamonds.
Ones that pave these broken streets, 
Ones that carry my dead weight.
Now my bed sheets look presentable.
And I feel the electric fire's orange glow
And I remember all the drunken promises made.
They lie shattered on the floor.
And I sit here wanting more.

It took some waiting to straighten out the bend
In and out of luck, yeah at times it was difficult

No sign of any rain
My skies are clear today
I keep bracing for that hit
But there's not sign of it

No obstacles in sight
My skies are clear tonight

I keep thinking, I might see that cloud arrive
Oh, but there's no sign of it, no sign of it

And as I look around, it's all new ground
The leaves on the trees touch down
But I'm above weightless as a dream
It's been a long road, a heavy load
I just simply had to go
Had to get here hard as it's been

In and out of luck, yeah at time it was difficult

Natalie Grant,"I stand in awe
That You know my name
Just a glimpse of Your love for me
And now I am changed
Because You showed me how
To walk a different way
I have peace like I've never known
I am living

You move me
Lord, You move me
There's a fire burning in my soul
And it's flowing through me
Lord, You move me
Lord, You move me
Now I must tell the world what I know
You move me

For too many years
I have been color blind
Only saw in shades of gray
Stuck in black and white
But by grace You opened my eyes
Now I see the light
And Your love has colored my world
And makes my soul cry

You move me
Lord, You move me
There's a fire burning in my soul
And it's flowing through me
Lord, You move me
Lord, You move me
Now I must tell the world what I know
Lord, You move me

Day after day I'm amazed
That You gave Your life for me
When I think of the price that You paid
How can I not say?

Lord, You move me
Lord, You move me
There's a fire burning in my soul
It's flowing through me
Lord, You move me
Lord, You move me
Now I must tell the world what I know
Lord, You move me

Natalie Grant,"Strong on the outside,
But coming apart at the seams, that's me
Tragically always together,
But bruised underneath, that's me

I stand just to stumble,
Tripping on my pride,
Why do I always try to hide

Meanwhile, back at my heart,
I'm desperate for all that you are,
Undo me, take me apart

Meanwhile, back at my soul,
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,
You know just where to start,
Back at my heart, back at my heart

Patiently waiting to pick up the pieces of me, that's you,
Healer of hearts, when the world leaves it broken in two, that's you,

Back at my heart, back at my fear,
Back at my brokenness, Lord meet me here,
No one's opposed, I'm not afraid anymore.

Natalie Grant,"I have been a wayward child,
I have acted out,
I have questioned sovereignty,
And had my share of doubts,

And though sometimes,
My prayers feel like the mountain of the sky,
The hand that holds won't let me go,
And is the reason why

I will stumble, I will fall down
But I will not be moved
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,
But I will not be moved

On Christ the solid rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand,
I will not be moved

Bitterness has plagued my heart,
Many times before,
My life has been a broken glass,
And I have kept the score,
Of all my shattered dreams,
And though it seemed,


That I was far too gone,
My brokenness helped me to see,
It's grace I'm standing on.

I will stumble, I will fall down
But I will not be moved
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,
But I will not be moved

On Christ the solid rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand,
I will not be moved

And chaos in my life,
Has been a badge of war,
And though I have been torn,
I will not be moved

I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,
But I will not be moved

On Christ the solid rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand,
I will not be moved",I Will Not Be Moved
Natalie Grant,"It's hard to stand on shifting sand
It's hard to shine in the shadows of the night
You can't be free if you don't reach for help
You cant love if you don't love yourself

There is hope when my faith runs out
'Cause I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground
So take this heart of mine there's no doubt
I'm in better hands now

I am strong all because of you
I stand in awe of every mountain that you move
Oh I am changed, yesterday is gone
I am safe from this moment on

There's no fear when the night comes 'round
I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground
So take this heart of mine there's no doubt
I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground

Natalie Grant,"She was only seventeen
Wild at heart and following her dreams
Even she was pretty, got a ticket to the city
Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine
It was only but it would lead the way
To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away
He said they'd take it slow but little did she know
She'd be all used up by the end of the day

But she was strong, she would survive
Ambition would be her drive

I'll make the way
I'll do whatever it takes even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though I may not understand
Someday I'll make a way
Here me say someday I'll make a way

Where did she go wrong
How did she get here
Living hard and looking older than her years
Miss Little Bigtown trying to hold a job down
Just doing what she could to choke her fears

But she was strong, she would survive
The spark of hope that kept her dream was not alive

I'll make a way
I'll do whatever it takes even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though I may not understand
Someday I'll make a way

Walking down the road
In the city where she'd come with so much hope
See her vision had long died
Along with all her pride
When she found herself at the end of her road
She heard angels through the doors
Of a church she'd passed a million times before
Inside the choirs song was ringing
Since she'd found herself believing
Out there maybe there was something more

And so she bowed her head to pray
She cried Jesus please make a way
And she heard Him say

I'll make a way
I'll do whatever it takes even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though you may not understand
Today I'll make a way
Hear Him say today He'll make a way

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Today He'll make a way
For you He's gonna make a way
For you He'll make a way",Make a Way (Britanny's Song)

Your life feels like a sinking ship
You're wondering how it came to this

Is it too late?
Is it too far?
For Him to reach you
And come to where you are

Step out on the edge
Don't be afraid of it
And when you feel the rain
Call His name
He'll find you in the hurricane

You're in the wreckage underneath
Your hope is buried somewhere deep
You're wondering how long it will keep?

It's never too late
Never too far
For you to reach out
And take a hold of love

Step out on the edge
Don't be afraid of it
And when you feel the rain
Call His name
He'll find you in the hurricane

Don't back down from the fight
He'll shelter you tonight
Just hold on for the change
Call His name
He'll find you in the hurricane

There's a place, there's a place you can run
When you fall, and it's all come undone
You'll be safe in the raging storm
So just let go
'Cause you are held in His arms

Step out on the edge
Don't be afraid of it
And when you feel the rain
Call His name
He'll find you in the hurricane

Oh oh

He'll find you in a hurricane",Hurricane

That he's outside of what you feel

Looks like we made it through the day

I love to watch you drift away
I would come with you but on my knees I'll stay

Take flight
Into your dreams and lullabies

But just fall more in love with you
And ask the angel armies to stand by

I will fall down flat

Of everything I don't know
And all I'm trying to be

Good night
There will be storms that we come through
In time
We will slay dragons me and you

I'll always wanna hold you tight
Keep you safe with all my might
So I will leave Jesus next to you
When I leave the room

And you will run ahead
As if you know the way
And I will pray more
Then one should have to pray

There will be words we can't take back
Silences too
And I'll be on my knees
You'll see

One night
When I am old and unsteady
You'll want me to fight
But I'll tell you that I'm ready

When there's nothing left to do
I will still be loving you

A burning bush, a flash of light

You calling my name
You pointing the way

I don't ever slow it down
Stop the wheels from going 'round

To take You at Your word
And know Your still small voice

I know I should wait on You

Spare me this heartache and change your plan

Help me want the Savior more than the saving

And you know I'd give anything for a remedy
And I'll ask a thousand more times to set me free today

Spent perfect days and sleepless nights whatever

Into something real
Wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now
I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

 Don't worry 
 'bout nothing 
 Don't know what's going on 
 I'm not one 
 Who can't say they're sorry 
 I just care what's going on

 And second hand opinions 
 Don't make you look any smarter 
 Don't you think 
 Don't you think 
 Don't you think that maybe 
 it's time , yes it's time 
 Time you started thinking 
 Time you started thinking 
 And don't just sweeten up the taste 
 Brother shoots brother 
 But meanwhile you're fixing up your face 
 You're not affected by the truth 
 Unless it's on your doorstep 
 Deodorise your paradise 
 No point in getting crazy 
 Don't you think 
 Don't you think 
 Don't you think that maybe 
 It's time , yes it's time 
 Time you started thinking 'bout things in the back of your head 
 Someone said before you turn a blind eye 
 Hear a bell ring sex sells everything 
 But I don't buy it so don't try it 
 Sleeping in the small world head in the sand 
 Better wash your hands , make a new plan 
 There's more important things 
 Than making sure your shoes just walk right 
 Ignore reality there's nothing you can do about it . . . 
 The clothes you wear don't make the man 
 It's just another party

Back home? But where is home?

Won't be long before I crush 
I'll stand in line 
Don't believe a thing they say   today 
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs 
All alone 
But I'm in a crowded room 
I'm sinking   in quicksand tonight 
You pick me up , and I shine across the sky till morning , then you 
colour me in 
Guess it won't amount

Seems to me I've lost my touch 
I'm back in line 
Don't believe a thing they say today 
Turn around and walk away

And place it in my pocket
Flick your eyes back in their sockets
Put those thoughts away
Sometimes they're much to loud
I'll take a breath
And cradle your sweet head
Should've stayed at home in bed
Put that face away
I'm melting for you
I know, I get cold
'cause I can't leave things well alone
Understand I'm accident prone
Me, I get free
Every night the moon is mine
But when the morning comes
Don't say you love me
Don't say you need me
I really don't think that's fair
Boy I'm not so dumb
But when you leave me
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there
I dreamt about another girl in bed with you
You just laughed and smiled
Denied the proof
We're fine till I think of the problem
I wish it made sense
Like a joke that no one gets
It's a life without regret
I want it to feel that way, forever and ever
I know, I get cold
'cause I can't leave things well alone
Understand I'm accident prone
Me, I get free
Every night the moon is mine
But when the morning comes
Don't say you love me
Don't say you need me
I really don't think that's fair
Boy I'm not so dumb

Natalie Imbruglia,"Why should it be,
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.
Haven't I learned,
People get hurt,
When they go diving in the deep end
In the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end.
Thought I was smart,
Controlling the art, of turning off my intuition
Haven't I seen, since I was fourteen.
That life is all just repitition
You lose or you win,
You sink or you swim,
When you go diving in the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end.
Now it's time to realise,
You don't have to agonise
You don't have to compromise
But the one thing you must do
Is open your eyes
Your eyes,
Your eyes.
Why should it be,
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.
Haven't I learned,
People get hurt,
When they go diving,
Diving, diving (fade).

Natalie Imbruglia,"I hear your silent scream
Deep in your private dream
Two ways to go from here
One way will bring you near
Fragile wish

Full moon, no rain, no shame
That distance still remains
More shades of grey to come
We've been through more than one
Close your eyes

Like a frightened child
Fragile in spirit
Like a wind blowin' wild
No name you can give it
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time

No tricks, no slight of hand
Find somewhere safe to land
Before your walls were shaken
But now the whole thing's brakin'
And it makes you feel

Like a frightened child
Fragile in spirit
Like a wind blowin' wild
No name you can give it
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time

What is right?
Yes it's night I can tell

Yes it shows
Yes I know

Natalie Imbruglia,"Lonely, lost every part of me
Maybe, outstayed my company
Walking in to sad scenes
Hold me tight and say goodbye
I've seen, behind tomorrow's sky
You be, my missing alibi
Bone me over backwards
Turn around and change my mind

Cause I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine

I swear, you've left me open
Nowhere, to hide this moment
Overcrowded daydreams
We're lost or so it seems

Cause I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine

Cause I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking into my appetite

Are you a friend of mine

Back home, but where is home

I'll stand in line
Don't believe a thing they say, today
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs
All alone
But I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking, in quick sand tonight
You pick me up, And I shine across the sky till morning, Then you colour me in
Guess it won't amount to much
Seems to me I've lost my touch

It matters most of all
You're not up for conversation
So I'm blinded by it all

The further away you push me
The closer I feel to you

Every fall
Every crash
Everything that was never meant to be
All the perfect little things I can't release
All the nights
Everytime we were just about to leave
Now makes no sense to me
But it seems that when we fall
That's when we land
Perfectly

Can't see what's before me
And I cannot feel the ground
This place that we exist in
Is the sweetest thing I've found

Falling over pieces of me

Foot down
Turn it around

All I need is you on the radio

No chance of sinking sailing ships

Is in you

I feel a little more than empty
But I want to feel more than full

It's a pity all I have
Is just enough to keep you satisfied

No matter how we try to keep it tied

Inside this bottle there's a message
You may be drinking way too much
If I had the strength to take the weight off you
I would

Something that keeps us together
You keep me dry despite the weather
I don't mean to feel this way for you

And hide that empty longing that you feel

And who will dry the tears that no one's seen?
There must be someone to share your silent dreams

Whisper the words of a prayer and you'll find Him there
Arms open wide, love in His eyes

Jesus, He heals your secret scars
All the love you're longing for
Is Jesus, the friend of a wounded heart

And hope deepens as you grow
And peace, beyond the reaches of your soul
Comes blowing through you, for love has made you whole

How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life

Let's fall in love again with music as our guide
We'll raise our ready hands and let go for the ride
Down into unknown lands where lovers meet and hide

We got these lives for free, we don't know where they've been
We don't know where they'll go when we are through with them
The starlight of the sun, the dark side of the moon

And in the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life, free life, free life

It seems so long ago, those empty afternoons
With nowhere much to go and nothing much to do
But sit up in my room and let the world unfold

And in the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?

In the air the questions hang
Will we get to do some, do something?
End up being
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?

Natalie Maines,"Looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
And maybe I'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so you never know

When I'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it
Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one

So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn

Oh lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come

It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever

Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

Oh lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

Well I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage i've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'm waiting for you

In the early morning light

On Sunset Boulevard 

Young and strong beautiful one 
We embraced so close

Include him in their prayers 
Let his image linger on 
Repeat it everywhere 

With candles, with flowers 
He was one of ours

Your casual slander 
You murder his memory

Lay beside your name 
Lay to rest your rage 
Your hunger and amazing grace 

With candles, with flowers 
You were one of ours 
One of ours 

I saw cameras expose your life 
I heard rumors explode with lies 
I saw children in tears 
Cry and crowd around the sight 
Of where you had collapsed that day 
Where your last breath and word 
Had been sighed 
Where your heart had burst 
Where you had died 

I saw how they were lost in grieving 
All half believing you were gone 
The loss and pain of it 
Crime and shame of it 
You were gone

A virtual stage, it seemed to me
Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

Well, I've walked these streets
In a carnival, of sights to see
All the cheap thrill seekers vendors and the dealers
They crowded around me

Have I been blind have I been lost
Inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen?

Well, I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond markets the scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me

And I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum they can be
Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped and he raved of saving me

Have I been blind, have I been lost
Inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen

Have I been wrong, have I been wise
To shut my eyes and play along
Hypnotized, paralyzed by what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen
What they have seen?

Have I been wise
Have I been strong
Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have found

We'll travel to Venus
we'll sail away to Mars
No one will see while we're kissing 
No one will know as we swoon
So come take a Trip in my Airship
and we'll visit the Man in the Moon 

One night while sailing away from the crowds 
we passed by the Milky White Way 
While idly drifting, watching the stars 
he asked if I'd name the day
Just by the Dipper, I gave him my heart 
the sun shone on our honeymoon 
We swore to each other, we never would part 
and we'd teach all the babies this tune",Come Take a Trip in My Airship
Natalie Merchant,"In a busy street, a man sits down
Oblivious to the traffic sounds
No chaos, no frenzied shrieking crowd
Thank God their silence, walking heads, bent down

Come when they saw us
Called it lethargy
The treadmill turns
There down below their feet

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or cross the waves of an angry sea
Risking, risking and braving, braving
The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing, assailing

In a haunted doorway and from the light of day
See another life fall to ruin in pain
False smiles from even children it seems
Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams

A league against me
I hear him say
It's not worth half the effort
Or the price you pay

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the Heavens above
And tell God, dear God, stop jeering and jeering
As our human frailties and all our failings, are we failing?

Pound, pound on an endless street
Again and again the nightmare scene
All strained against the tightened rope
Not one with a lasting lingering hope

There's evidence
Everywhere you see
Put a quarter down at the newsstand
So that you can read

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the clouds above
Entreating, entreating
Their mercy, some mercy

But as clouds will do, they'll rain down
First gently, gently and sweetly, so sweetly
Until they silence me
With a burst of thunder, thunder and lightning and lightning
And helpless landlocked screaming
I know god must be agreeing

It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part

Landlocked in screaming
God must be agreeing
To be helpless is the worst
Must be the worst part of watching
The worst part of watching",Party of God
Natalie Merchant,"Well, I've walked these streets 
A virtual stage, it seemed to me
Makeup on their faces

Natalie Merchant,"On the night that I was married
And upon my marriage bed
There all came a bold sea captain
And he stood at my bed-head

Sayin', ?Arise, arise, young wedded man
And come along with me
To the lowlands of Holland
To fight the enemy?

Now then Holland is a lovely land
And upon it grows fine grain
Sure it is a place of residence
For a soldier to remain

Where the sugarcane is plentiful
And the tea grows on each tree
Well, I never had but the one sweetheart
And now he's gone far away from me

I will wear no stays around my waist
Nor combs all in my hair
I will wear no scarf around my neck
For to save my beauty there

And never will I marry
Not until the day I die
Since these four winds and these stormy seas
Came between my love and I

Natalie Merchant,"I found this photograph,
Underneath the broken picture glass.
Tender face of black and white,
Beautiful, a haunting sight.
Looked into an angel's smile,
Captivated all the while.
From the hair and clothes she wore,
I'd place her in between the wars.

Was she willing when she sat
And posed the pretty photograph?
Save her flowering and fair,
The days to come, the days to share.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

I found this photograph,
Stashed between the old joist walls,
In a place where time is lost,
Lost behind, where all things fall.
Broken books and calendars,
Letters script in careful hand,
Music too, a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band.

From the threshold what's to see
Of our brave new century?
The television's just a dream,
The radio, the silver screen.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day,
Was she hopeful, did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside,
Family secrets, sworn to hide?
Did she feel the beat that stirs,
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend,
The love and laughter, 'til the end?

Natalie Merchant,"Maggie and Milly and Molly and May
Went down to the beach (to play one day)
And Maggie discovered a shell that sang
So sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles, and

Milly befriended a stranded star
Whose rays five languid fingers were;
And molly was chased by a horrible thing
Which raced sideways while blowing bubbles: and

May came home with a smooth round stone
As small as a world and as large as alone.
For whatever we lose (like a you or a me)
It's always ourselves we find in the sea",Maggie and Milly and Molly and May
Natalie Merchant,"I had a silver penny
And an apricot tree
And I said to the sailor
On the white quay

Sailor O sailor
Will you bring me
If I give you my penny
And my apricot tree

'A fez from Algeria
An Arab drum to beat
A little gilt sword
And a parakeet?'

And he smiled and he kissed me
As strong as death
And I saw his red tongue
And I felt his sweet breath

You may keep your penny
And your apricot tree
And I'll bring your presents
Back from sea.'

O the ship dipped down
On the rim of the sky
And I waited while three
Long summers went by

Then one steel morning
On the white quay
I saw a grey ship
Come in from sea

Slowly she came
Across the bay
For her flashing rigging
Was shot away

All round her wake
The seabirds cried
And flew in and out
Of the hole in her side

Slowly she came
In the path of the sun
And I heard the sound
Of a distant gun

And a stranger came running
Up to me
From the deck of the ship
And he said, said he

O are you the boy
Who would wait on the quay
With the silver penny
And the apricot tree?

I've a plum-coloured fez
And a drum for thee
And a sword and a parakeet
From over the sea.'

O where is the sailor
With bold red hair?
And what is that volley
On the bright air?

O where are the other

He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
Now he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.
Now if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
If you lose the devil gets your soul.

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Now, you're pretty good ol' son,
But just sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

He played ""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house with the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan picking out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.

And Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.

I done told you once you son of a gun, I'm the best that's ever been.""

Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love  you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't' want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

One day Ima learn hoe ass niggaz ain't worth my while
Funny style actin, dirty maccin, playa hatin, contemplatin, fuckin my thoughts up
I get caught up in this bullshit, the way bitches bullshit
Niggaz be jealous, sometimes even my fellas
Things change, niggaz rearrange whether ya tell us
Life is bullshit, and I know that this is true
Sometimes I feel depressed, what can a nigga do?
ain't no way out, only way out is the route of a slug point blank at my mug
Sometimes I just want to scream at the world, I'm mad
Other times I feel happy just to be sad
I don't really got much more to say
cus people die everyday, and we gonna all die anyway
Its kinda hard, but who said life was fair
And from the funky stains in my underwear
I don't care

[MASTAMIND]
No I don't care no more
No I don't care if niggaz stare at me
Look at my face, I ain't happy
Bitch what you want to come at me with?
Not that same shit, see I'm shameless
And I hang with that mentally derranged click
Stay up off it, you can't change this
can't teach a wicked witch new tricks
Hell's the fire on the candle sticks
Stay off these bloody streets
for you ain't gonna see no peace
I just don't give a fuck cus nobody gives a fuck about me
So we be like fuck 'em, mother fuck 'em, can't trust 'em
I'd rather .45 slug 'em before the grave diggers dug 'em
I'm ready when you not
my mind's twisted in a knot
Can't let jealous niggaz see me cause they'll kill me on the spot
Truth or dare, my gun gonna shoot up in the air
Pieces of my mind over there, and there
But I don't care

[ESHAM]
How can I care about somethin when I don't give a fuck about nothing.  You
don't care about me, you don't love me, and I don't love me.  So fuck you, and
fuck you, fuck he, fuck she and fuck your G-O-D nigga.  You know what I'm sayin?",I Don't Care

12 in the mornin, woke up with the shakes
Serial killa, Mr. Frosted Flakes
My hands were all bloody and I don't know why
I'm thinkin bout my bitch and why she had to die
Some niggaz out to get me said she settin me up
They pulled out they pistols started wettin me up
I seen my life pass before my eyes in a flash
I drew down my weapon and I started to blast
My bitch caught a slug in the back of the neck
I emptied out the tech and niggaz hit the deck
I ran for the beamer it was sittin in front
I left my bitch's body smokin like a philly blunt
And it was

(CHORUS)
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, it all happened
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, they started cappin

I'm bleedin like a motherfucker grabbin my chest
My heartbeat racin like a EMS
I called my partner up on the portable phone
I blew my bitch brains out with the chrome
My nigga said he'd meet me at the Omni hotel
Court date was today and he just jumped bail
Police out to get him, he was under arrest
Bitch warrant for my nigga with the mental stress
Met my nigga at the spot and he had nothin to say
Metro airport to East L.A.
When we got the city it was drama again
Seen a nigga that we jacked in 89 for 10
And it was

(CHORUS)

The nigga started trippin he was wavin his gun
Pissed off since 89 cause we murdered his son
Straight bullets started flyin every way but in mine
Still bleedin like a pig and I'm pressed for time
I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face
Now I'm madder than a motherfucker tryin to embrace
My homie body turned cold, I felt him slippin away
He was just here alive now he dead today
And the nigga who had shot him, he was shot on the floor
So I went to his body and I shot him some more
He looked me dead in the face and said you're going to hell
I spit blood in his face as I started to yell

Never talk about weed on your Bernie Mack cellular

With no worries in they eyes but time for the crime

Life's hard what am I supposed to do in this cold life
Only thing I really know how to do is hold mics
On cold nights we the hottest
On the blocks or the projects
Bless the mic for Natas
Now the heat is on we got the streets warm
We'll only stop setting shit on fire when the beat is gone
Keep it strong money keep it long
With each song history is born we da wrong
Cats to collapse so what the beef is on
Never cry about the pain if the game treat us wrong

Me and honey sipping Boone's finna go to the room
As I zoomed into the feature times rhyme with the clarity
No, I said it was all good in the land of prosperity
So I fly through the sky with a blink of an eye
Under the shade of my sombrero wouldn't think it was I
Mama see a seniorita we was smoking some reefer
She was hoping that I keep her but I'm nothin but a creaper
It gets deeper with the street sweeper
But on a day like today I just sit in back and parlay
In see-A-N, see-you-N
If you girl ain't bumping I bump her best 
friend in Cancun, yo in Cancun, yo I said
in Cancun, yo yo in Cancun

Hot like Cancun clock bank like Tommy Mottola
If you be a snake I'm a call you a boa
Constrictor till you get the pict-cha
As I squig the liquor
Drop the bigger figures
Ain't no stopping yo seniorita so tropi-co 
Cop a O and drop a flow
Cop a 4 with a 4-4 your undercover love go
From to Detroit to Chicago or wherever I go
I keep my blow tighter than the hair on your hoe
Under the cherry moon down in Cancun
I'm all about the boom 
Honeys know I'm about to hit the boom  boom
Up in Cancun all about the boom

and ask JFK if flyin through the skies you can die
And all the ballers out there cookin them pies
do you even realize why we lookin so high?
It's a surprise, It's the end for us all

I feel the force drag me into the light
The same one who stole the life in the still of the night

with all my might.)

I often wonder, do dead men dream?
about the life they lived and all the fancy things?
about who was paid? and who was broke?
about who had the most money, ho's and dope?
about that one nigga who just couldn't cope
life came down crashin like a nigga on a ski slope
Can I rock this one for Redd Fox?
I saw Biggie Smalls, I saw Tupac
I saw the nigga with the gun bust 2 shots
some of you believe me and some of you do not

Support us, look how far the dead brought us
2000 AD rock the funeral parlors

Stood out in the rain all day, little did I know
When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

I'm free to make my mind up you either got it or you don't 

[Chorus] 
This is my current single status 
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm tradin' places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant 

I'm single 
(Right now) 
That's how I want to be 
I'm single 
(Right now) 
That's how I want to be 

Ah yeah Uh Huh that's right 

Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good 
(I like who I am) 
I'm not saying I don't want to fall in love ''cause I would 
I'm not gonna get hooked up just ''cause you say I should 
(Can't romance on demand) 
I'm gonna wait so I'm sorry if you misunderstood 

[Chorus] 

Everything in it's right time everything in it's right place 
I know I'll settle down one day 
But 'til then I like it this way it's my way 
Eh I like it this way 

Make your move if you want doesn't mean I will or won't 
I'm free to make my mind up you either got it or you don't 
'Til then I'm single 

This is my current single status 
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm tradin' places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant",Single [Live]

Understand you
Open up your heart

Open up your mind
Nobody needs another stalker in your life
I'm only here to help you learn to love me
To know me

[Chorus]
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you, makes you want to stay. 
Don't want to speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't want to blink 'cause in a second you could be gone
I need a twist to help me to turn the story round
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through

Did ya see me staring
You caught my eye
Don't turn around
Don't walk away

The night is young, can we get together?
Got so many questions
Feelings I can't explain
We're worlds apart

Don't even know your name
I'm longing to give you my heart

[Chorus]

Turn around, don't evaporate
Like you never came 
Turn around don't be a ghost
Forever never there to haunt me

Sliding doors
They aren't just on a train
We're alone on a platform in the rain
There's a chance
And it won't come again
Turn around your whole life has changed

Of where my heart has been

Drop my defences down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow

[Chorus]
I bruise easily
So be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily

I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too
But if I never take this leap of faith
I'll never know
So im learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow

Anyone who can touch you
Can hurt you or heal you
Anyone who can reach you
Can love you or leave you

Goin' on a shopping spree
Pick something out to look good on me
I want quality
Not quantity
Want a classic
Not a trend
Casual yet still high end
I know what I want
And I'm not afraid to spend

So if you
Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

I'm checking out
Goods on display
Don't play it safe or too risque
I'm done window shopping
I'm ready to pay
I'm going up
Fifth floor
The best stuff's in store
Cos that's where they keep
What every girl would die for

So if you
Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Everythings perfect
When you're looking through the glass
The colors can fade as seasons pass
This time I wanna, wanna nail them to the mast

Fit me tight but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favourite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Fit me tight but let me breathe

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody

Natasha Bedingfield,"Standing still but still moving
Lying down but not resting
Breathing air, suffocating
All the while, I'm debating

Life was never what I thought
Never what I wanted it to be

Had a plan, couldn't follow
Had a dream, it was hollow
Everywhere felt like nowhere
Everything was so boring

Life was never what I wanted
Never what I thought
Until you came and turned it all around

Oh, you found the peace of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me
I was empty, now I'm better
All my peace is back together

Restless ways for a living
Fitting in 'cause I was driven
Saying yes when I meant no
Holding on, should've let go

I was scattered all around
Left shattered on the ground
You picked me up

All I wanted was a little bit of hope
Couldn't find it
You showed me something
That I never knew I owned
You put a light to it

Oh, you found the peace of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me
I was empty, now I'm better
'Cause you pieced me back together

What a life, always tried
What a life, lived without you
Don't leave me, and I won't
Fall apart, I won't leave you
And it's cold and I'm blind
And I would and it feels good
What a waste on my mind
Every time, all the time

Oh, you found the whole of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me
I was empty, now I'm better

Natasha Bedingfield,"I've been sizin' you up and stuff
Watchin you live life large
Enough for the both of us

Got the measure of the man in you
It's more than the sum of the parts
It's true what they say
You gotta big up the love

I've been checkin' nice things you do
Standing in the Starbucks queue
You buy coffee for a stranger
Who's down on their luck

Oh, don't confuse me when I say
Oh, please don't take this the wrong way
You can lead a heart to love
But you can make it fall
I'm tired of loving small 'cause

Size matters and not how you think
I'm talking bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant
The more flowers will grow
So big up the love 'till it overflows

Most blokes to shallow to swim in
Only interested in one thing
It's all so meaningless
'cause puddles dry up
With a view of the world so small
It limits the size of the dream
And you achieving it
A new panorama
With your arms around me,
I see my life how it should be

I'm not the kind of girl you kiss in public 
My manners leave a lot to be desired 
At least in not a liar 
I'm not about the subtle innuendo 
More likely to throw rocks up at your window 
Won't walk on eggshells 
so you don't hear the crazy things

I'd rather disappear than be faking it

Anyway, you like me yeah you know it 
You're so transparent 
How you stumble 'round those words so well 
You like me there I said it 
Don't need a dictionary helping me 'cause I can spell

They need glasses to believe it 
They don't understand so be it
What can I say anyway

By the way you lift me up when I'm fading

So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Oh, oh, oh

I break tradition, sometimes my tries, are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes, but I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken

I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
I'm looking out, hmmm

It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Hmm, wide open spaces far away

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh

Yeah, oh oh, ye-yeah

I see the girl I want to be
Riding bare-back, care-free
Along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping head-first, head-long
Without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I want to break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear, but not feel scared

I want some one to take the time fine dining not rushing

I keep my fingers crossed, you're not like all the rest, 
So when you come to pick me up come right to my door 
Don't stay in your car and beep beep the horn 

Baby I'm a hopeless romantic 
You pick the sounds for the background to our drive into town 
Baby don't be one of the traffic

My skin is like a map, where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks, but it's not a negative thing
So I lay down my guard, drop my defenses, down by my clothes

There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily

Do your know you're leaving them all over this heart of mine too
If I never take this leap of faith I'll never know

Silly jokes and fairy tales
Where did we leave them?

Your cowboy hat, my tutu
You hide and seek, I catch you
Why can't we be how we were in the backyard
In the backyard

Simple days of hand in hand
And drawing our names in the sand
Somehow life just complicates
Our buried treasure it just waits
Lost in the backyard

You hide and seek, I catch you
Why can't we be how we were in the backyard

You and I and hide behind the rose bed

Away from the sun, growing nowhere fast
Rushing along on the pavement

Growing through the cracks
And you didn't even notice

Wake up, take a moment
Grab it in your hands... and own it

Been neglecting the thing most precious to me
You've been talking but I haven't been listening
The static in the noise been drowning you out

Over my own shoe laces
In these human races
And I'm brought back to now

Natasha Bedingfield,"I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Oh, oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Natasha Bedingfield,"Ooooh

I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
I'm looking out, hmmm
Is this my life I'm wondering
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Hmm, wide open spaces far away

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Ooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh

Yeah, oh oh, ye-yeah

I see the girl I want to be
Riding bare-back, care-free
Along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping head-first, head-long
Without a thought
To act and down the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I want to break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear, but not feel scared

Oooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh

I want to run too
Oooh oh oh oh
Recklessly emboundening myself before you
I want to open up my heart
Tell him how I feel, ooh ooh

Oooh, wild horses I want to be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I want to run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses

Natasha Bedingfield,"(Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum)
I used to care so much about what others think about,
I almost didn't have a thought of my own.
The slightest remark would make me embark on the journey
Of self-doubt, but that was a while ago.
This girl has got stronger, and if I knew then what I know now,
I would've told myself don't worry any longer, it's ok

Cause a face without freckles is like the sky without the stars.
Why waste a second, not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable -
They show your personality - inside your heart,
Reflecting who you are (whispers: who you are 3xs)

Whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa
I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Will the whole world fall at my feet
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness
I could see, when the mirror looked at me
(sometimes I feel) sometimes I still feel like that little girl who doesn't belong in her own world I reminded myself that

Cause a face without freckles is like the sky without the stars.
Why waste a second, not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable -
They show your personality - inside your heart,
Reflecting who you are (whispers: who you are 3xs)

Landlords Knocking at my door cussing me out
Got laid off my job the night before
Can't figure how
I'm gonna fix tomorrow away
If today's still a mess
Can u tell me what's the point man,
It all seems meaningless
I wish that I could step away and breathe
This world's trying to swallow me
Clear away the clouds inside my head

Someone just tell me
That it's OK now
What are you worried about

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy
People lie, people hide, people cry, people fight

And they don't know why
If fear is all that we should fear
Then what are we so afraid of
Cause fear is only in our heads

Someone please say'

Any day ill go bad thinking bad
Everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
During my stressing I'm blinded to the lesson

I''m trying to beat is hiding inside of me

Listen, 'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right,
I want a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

And you always wanna fix what's broke, broke.
You keep searching through the rubble,

Sometimes it feels like I'm raining on the inside,
And all the things that I'm trying I don't get it right.
Yeah, sometimes, I fall but I get up,
And it takes a while but I get there in my own time.

If you wanna give me what I want,
Listen, 'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

Love is a very wide open door,
You can go through every time you want more.
Why do I feel like the glass is half full,
When I've got enough of it to feel, a swimming pool.

If you wanna give me what I crave,
Hold me so I can feel your love.

Natasha Bedingfield,"I'm at the point of almost breaking now
I've knocked on every door in this cold town
(Yeah)
The higher you go the harder you fall
If I wanna be safe then I just stay small
Wanna grow to the sky where it's beautiful
But I can't see that from the forest floor

How can I hold it together
When nothing I try makes it better
I just wanna lay here forever
'Cause if I don't get up, then I can't fall down

There is no manual for a broken heart
I want to use it but it's all in parts
(Oh)
The more you fall in, The harder to see
If this time it's different will I want to release
And I don't know if I have it in me
To love again in a face of defeat

How can I hold it together
When nothin' I try makes it better
Just wanna lay here forever
Us if I don't get up then I can't fall down
(Yeah yeah yeah, oh)
(And if I don't get up I won't let me down)

Hope is irresistible
Hope is irresistible
'Cause if I don't get up one day I will some how

Nothing I try makes it better
I just wanna lay here forever

Natasha Bedingfield,"Sometimes it hits like a car crash, and its too late too reverse
Sometimes you make me a better person, sometimes you bring out the worst

Sometimes we get on like fire
Sometimes we stopping like rain
Just when I think that its over,over
You wave a white flag again

Everybody hurts just a little too much
Everybody hurts but its never enough
Its wonderful to fall
Its love and risk it all
I'd rather love just a little too much

Sometimes we're trapped in a circle
'Til we're digging holes in the ground
We try but nothing is working
But still I want you around

Cause if I'm lost in the desert
I know somehow you'll find me
And if i drive in the ocean, you'll be
The first to rescue me

Everybody hurts just a little too much
Everybody hurts but its never enough
Its wonderful to fall
Its love and risk it all
I'd rather love just a little too much

Everybody hurts just a little too much

Its wonderful to fall

Natasha Bedingfield,"Everyday there's a thousand things
That somehow pass us by,
Go cut through the noise
So you can know what love sounds like
I'm comin' to your frequency,
To 106 point me
So there's no
Distractions

Take a breath
Take it in
Love has no expiration date
My heart will always beat for you
At a constant rate
It will outlast everything
You think is set is stone
It goes on and on and on and on,
On and on and on and on...

Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love

We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other

Oh it feels like...

Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?

Everyone is looking for a special connection
But it's like your compass points
A million directions
Do you need me to buy you
A telescope so you can see
How good
This could be

Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel me love?

Oh!

And I'll wait for you
As long as it takes
Until I get through
And it hits you right in the face

Can you feel my lo-o-ove?
Can you feel my love?

Natasha Bedingfield,"Too many things go unsaid cause you think you can't say them right
Get them out in the open instead of all bottled up inside
Cause I don't mind if it comes out all emotional
And I don't mind as long as what you say is real
I know you're the kind of man who wants to show your best side
But we can't always be perfect, and that's alright
Don't over think it, you don't have to perform for me
You want to know how to touch me, well it's easy

Oh, it's like playing the piano
I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
You don't have to be a Mozart, if you just play it from the heart
Oh oh
It's like playing the piano
Your fingers know just where to go
You don't have to be a Mozart, if you just play it from the heart

I know once something's been spoken aloud it can't be taken back
But don't be too proud, too proud to risk that
Between the tension the major and the minor chords
There's a magic we're waiting for, we're waiting for
Oh, it's like playing the piano
I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
You don't have to be a Mozart, if you just play it from the heart

You don't have to be a Mozart, no, if you just play it from the heart

Oh, the way you're playing that piano
I got a Mozart of my own
The way you're running up and down those keys
Sounds like a symphony to me
Oh 
You wanna know how to touch me well it's easy
Oh, it's like playing the piano
I don't care if there's a few wrong notes

Natasha Bedingfield,"Been torn apart,
Got so many scratches and scars,
Maybe they wont all go away,
But they'll fade,
Maybe time can mend us together.. again.
Its not what we've done but, how far we've come.

We will recover
The worst is over, now.
All those fires we've been walking through,
And still we survive, somehow.
We will recover
The worst is behind
And it hurts, but in time, I know that we will recover.
(Yeah yeah)

Got so much to lose,
Seems I've lost my power to choose, oh
What to love and when to let go,
That all changed,
Get bitten once and then your afraid
What a waste,

And everybody fights but, not everyone survives
And everybody's searching, not everybody finds
And I'm still in recovery, and I'll make it alive?

When I tripped and spilled my coffee
On a man who yelled at me
And then walked off in a hurry

Now he's gonna be late for work
So he called his secretary
Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby

Who's been waiting for a while
And talking on the phone
Got invited to a party and thought he couldn't go

But he's here right now
Standing in my house
And someone turns the music loud

So we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Yeah we dance
And we laugh

Gonna party all night till the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us

When we dance
When we laugh

I was planning out my party
Running errands 'round the city
Grocery bags full of alcohol
And chocolate chip cookies

Saw a dress that was amazing
In the window of a boutique
So I went across the street
Then my heel broke and it threw me

I tried to catch my balance
But I was 'sposed to fall
It seems that spilling coffee
Was no accident at all

'Cause you're here right now
Sitting on my couch
Funny how it all works out

When we dance
And we laugh

Yeah we dance

And every road we take
Every interaction
Starts a chain reaction
We're both affected when we least expect it
And then when we touched
Then it all connected

Just leave me alone

Might as well get used to you hanging around

Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone

Might as well get used to you hanging around

Natasha St-Pier,"Quand viennent pleurer tes soirs de solitude
Quand l'absence d'amour vient détruire tes rêves
Tu ressens chaque jours l'ennui qui se lève

Emotionally backed up against the door

Said it so many times
There's no reason, no rhyme
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

What's for real, you know, it's your choice, baby
Here we go, it's the story about me and you, that's right

When we were younger, growin' up together, we would talk
We'd share our problems and we'd call each other after dark
And you would tell me that she left you with a broken heart again

I'd lie awake and I'd imagine I was holding you
Just like a sister, I'd be there to guide and comfort you
And I would play the fool just to see your smile again

But you gotta stop wastin' my time, boy

Gone are the days when it was simple easy livin' boy
We've both grown older and we've found our place within this world
But when I see you with her, it just keeps breakin' my heart again

I wish that you could see the lovin' that I feel for you

I don't wanna waste another breath on you

And I really don't know why I bothered
Askin' why, listenin' to your excuses
I wanna rewind, cause now I know the truth is
I'm better off alone

I can't forgive this time
I'm done pretending to be blind

I'm being criticized
I can always find
Compassion in your eyes
I could have all the money in the world

And I'm always gonna reach too high

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door
'Cuz I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful
And I ain't coming back no more

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Nate Birkey,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know

The chestnut trees, the wishing well

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Nate Dogg,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the eats side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the two one to Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin' me I'm glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers and said, ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They gonna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I could fly let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me the Warren to the G

Just like I thought they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell I said, ""Ooh I like your style""

She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the East Side Motel

I'm tweaking onto a whole new era
G-Funk step to this I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level
The rhythm is the base and the base is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody G-Funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

If you know like I know you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era, funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster 213 will regulate",Regulate [Jamming Mix]

Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them

Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bulshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
I'm mashin' with the click 2-1-3 that is
They my homeboys ever since kids-
Real friends to the end

Hangin' out with my homies and I'm feelin' just fine
I've been ponderin' lately
A lot of different things on my mind
It seems lately my friends list
Done took a slight decline
And if you wanna know the truth man, man
Them wasn't no friends of mine

You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Deezy
Pressure and strikes
Don't wann take no lives
But these jaws, cracks and hood cracks
Will make you break bizacks

A familly to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like you

Stayin' tight and money right
And bustin' with a 44

It's the grave or incarceration
I know you hurt but you can't replace em
You go and dig a hole then erase em
You just created a smaller nation

I really hope you're kinda patient

When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies

You tell me that you want me, I tried to hide my feelings, d-o-g's
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)

There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing I really want you to do

Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real g's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be macking
I can't lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, ok
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone

Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

I'm sittin' here trippin'
My mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock
No one can do it better like this 2 man crew
They say we're one hit quitters
So what cha'll gonna do?

Always into somethin', that's my name
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who has the most is he who won the match

Strike one
Me and Nate Dogg is a match
Stike two
Leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three
You can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

My exhibition started back in '93
No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see
Nobody does it better than me

[Chorus]

They call me DJ and the spark plug
Keepin' it licked
There is no accident for these platinum hits
So when we make it to show love,
Bangin' in your club
Hangin' with your thugs
Givin' up G love

Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you think you really wanna step to me
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

[Chorus]

Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby
So I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now

All you pimp playin' hustlers, now ya know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me

Nate Dogg,"I ain't got no time for no bitches
I gotta clock my dough clownin'
Hittin' switches in a green 6-4
With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo
A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone ""what's happenin'?""
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking silver satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney motherfucker that they call kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some gin in his cup

Now I found myself blowin' out smoke 
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of the hoes
It's kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four
I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks
But I don't love that trick bitch
'cause bitches gettin' niggas dick sick
I don't pay pay rent, my rent gets paid
I pimp hoes like silky train
On and on it goes
I thought these motherfuckers knew, but now you know

Puppy love, call it what you want, bitch

1975 I was just a young pup
Tryin' to learn to be a dogg
But in the process steadily gettin' fucked
I met this lil' sexie dame y'all before I knew
All the rules to the game
It ain't no need to lie
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me
I thought I'd die
Y'all don't ask, I don't the reason why
Thought she was sent from the heavens above
Y'all it's just a bad taste of puppy love

Puppy love
Puppy love
Puppy love

Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be
Before I got converted to a d-o-double g
I'd like to thank that girl
From way back in the days
Cause if it weren't for you I wouldn't pimp this way

Why I don't like love

Maybe its because I know
As soon as I tell her
How I feel about her

But you don't know what I'm going through
You say you really care for me
But in love there's no guarantee
So, I think I outta take my time
'cause love ain't no friend of mine you see

Don't let me get you too confused
You're the friend I don't want to lose
If I made a choice its you I choose
But my heart's a tad bit through
So, I try to get you off my mind
But a remedy I cannot find for you

I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)

I'm never gonna try to find
Another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
But traces they'll never find
No, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)
Won't be nothing gettin' back to you

Now don't think that I'm being rude
Because I won't commit to you
And other women want to screw

So, I'll be slippin' on my hat
I won't be bringin' nothing back to you

And I'ma ask you is it runnin', baby?
You ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug
And fucked doggy style on a bear skin rug
Up and down stairs in the back of a limo
On interstate 5 on the way to San Francisco

I really go crazy baby
When I see a sexy girl

You make me,
You make me go

I'm having a ball
Watch out for I fall
I'm headed for the girl that's standing on the wall
No flashing no bills
Just testing my skills

Let me tell you this about me
Momma kicked me out when I was sixteen
Woke up the next mornin' with some D-O-G's
I felt a little bad but I had money
Went and bought some dope and some blue khakis
While you were hangin' out in the promised land
I was growin' up on the Long Beach sand
So if you're intentions were to leave with me
Remember when I'm satisfied
I'm just as cold as can be, stone cold

Damn this is a cavi beat
I feel like takin' time on this beat
To smash you all
But teachers are supposed to teach
So I'ma teach and you gon' listen or else you got to fall
To battle that's a thing that I've always done
Never lost a battle that means I'm number one
Don't hang with cowards 'cause they always run
If you be rollin' with cowards don't forget your gun (ah)
Damn I really love to compete
Another victim I would love to delete
Come one come all
Taste the agony of defeat
But I know how sneaky niggas can be
When're they fall

Some niggas try to take my cash
Dumb niggas try to make me blast
These days it's kinda hard to laugh
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past

For the gangsta lean, when I roll through in a rider
You looking at a ""coast to coast G""
I got love, but I still stash the toaster closely
We bailing on police rides, cause Nate
Got some sticky so strong you could smell it on the Eastside

Got 'em lounging in the lobby
Automatic tacts automatically cause tragedies and catastrophies
Suckers! (I got love)
And all the homies round up, throw the pound up
Kurupt out to show y'all how to strut like what (I got love)
Pros, they adore me, I keep all pros lookin for me

I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord I'ma get it
In the worst way, slay, competition
Move the opposition, back wake the fuck up! (uh-huh)
Cause when I get beyond enemy lines
I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty
RIDE for the funk, CRY for the funk
In the heat of night, I DIE for the funk
Pharoahe, when I'm six feet deep there's no grieving
Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance cause

There's no way o' dividin' me
'Cause my OG's in the streets gon' ride for me
I-I, promise to do ghetto things
'Cause I'm the closest thing to ghetto in this industry
That's why I be chillin' when it's 90 degrees

Fuck her whole life off, donate my kidney (Yeah!)
Wake up to vodka, crash with the whiskey
My name holdin' to much weight, you can't lift me
Came from my first out ghetto with King Tipsy
Hold a torch over my city, you can't miss me
Niggas say fuck me but can't fuck wit' me
Twist this shit, make your finger tips sticky
I need me a wify, shit I mean wifey

They can't separate my music from me

I hit em with the music from the slave
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave
I don't want to think I don't know
They thought me how to reach deep down and touch the soul
Without my music, where would I be
You thought me how to cry and still remain a G
You keep a lot of soldiers at ease
And together the next next level proceed

Put 3 to ya tummy, 2 to ya throat
And bulletproof cars, we ride like the pope

Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging
Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming
Macking, trying to get some action, packing, acting
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girls at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interruption, busted my girls in the club

All I'm trying to do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend

This funk is for them rowdy niggas liable to shank ya
A cock back blast, wit no questions asked
So just, hold tight, don't let the liquor run your whole night
Don't let a sucker into courage fuck up your whole life
I play the cut and analyze the view
Push up my glass just to acknowledge the chosen few
Cause I don't fuck wit many
Especially the tough ones off a glass of Henny
Especially the ones always frontin' that don't have a penny
I run wit niggas that demand respect
And I'm a boss bitch, most y'all can't handle that
All you can do is watch your glide
It take a special type 'a nigga 
'Bout something that can stop a stride
Cause I can't respect a nigga that's soft
And I bet y'all never seen it comin'

As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
Its true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real gs gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But whats the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in Id probably be macking
I cant lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of player hood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is tripping she got a block on the phone

Nate Dogg,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Just rolling in my ride, chilling all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothers shooting dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said ""what's up?""
Some brothers pulled some Gats, so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peeping me, I'mma glide and swerve
These hookers looking so hard they straight hit the curb
On to big better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm getting jacked, I'm breaking myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound-for-pound
I've got to come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They've got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happening in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

16 in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they dropping and yelling
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my Gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak-mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks, and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me: the Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ooh, I like your size
She said my car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings, we brings
Melody, G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate",Regulators
Nate Dogg,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",Till I Collapse
Nate James,"See now I'm not the picky type, 
But I'm gonna go out and get what's mine 
Got to quest my appetite,

Wanna set my record straight,

No need for no rehearsal, 
Seen everything I need to know. 
'Cause I'm keeping this universal. 

Sometimes feel you got me wrong, 
Won't come get your conversation on 
Feel I'm quite approachable, 
Don't let my propriate get out no 
In time ill settle down, 
Then my queen can share my crown 
But for now just gonna go out,

Left you, falling on the floor
Headed for the door
Went straight to Philidelphia
Oh no, what have I begun?
Called my mother, said I love her
Had another and another one
Questions, questions, suddenly suggestions
Where was anyone at the start of this thing?
Hold that gold up over your shoulder
All I needs a place to grieve

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Now I’m over my head
Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I’m from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm
Oh, I know, I can’t believe
That I'd let it get to me
Good to know I won’t become
Everything I’m afraid of

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive

If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Mama don’t cry
I was once your little baby boy
So full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement
Lower than the basement
And I couldn’t stand to smile
I thought of taking my own life
But mama don’t cry
I found songs among the tragic
Hung my hat on sadness
Mom, I think they’re trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I’m ready to free this grand romantic in me

I watched you walk slow past my window
Is that what you did it for?
I think it's best you left me alone
You know I'm bound to make you cry
From up here I can see the Carlyle
I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes
I never meant to set the world on fire
Just wanted something you'd remember me by

But now I wish that I was on the bright side
These friends of mine could spend the whole night dreaming
While you're holding me tight under the moonlight
Just you and I, we'll lead a new life singing
La la la

You know, I think it says a lot
That I could wake myself up from this dream
Grab the things that are most dear to me
And although I could have loved you better
I had to get the fuck out of the bed
Cause there's just something about you my love
Something in the way you comb your hair
And fall apart at the seams
When you were young I used to throw you down
You'd show me how it feels to feel

Oh God, I wish that I was on the bright side
These friends of mine could spend the whole night dreaming
While you're holding me tight under the moonlight

Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

I’ve been lost in this maze
Losing love, losing friends
Losing faith in chemicals
Afraid one day you’ll find me
Asleep above the stars
I watch my mother cry
Father Time is catching up
I keep the phone by my side
Afraid she’ll wake me up to catch the next flight
In time to say goodbye

But sometimes I fall asleep at night
To the TV light and it sings
Oh ooo whoa oh
One day the sun will break into the room

Because we’re holding our own in a great big storm
And though we’re cutting it close
We won’t let go
Oh no I can’t believe
Everything falling down around me
But now we’re holding our own
And won’t let go
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

Broken hearts broken homes and broken bones
Secret love let me go
You know I gotta find my own way
Through mistakes that I can’t change
Because there’s beauty in every sin
Every single black eye
Has some blue like the moon just before the sun shines
No I don’t believe in all the things that they preach

But sometimes I fall asleep at night
And I just know you’re smiling at me
Oh ooo whoa oh
One day I’m gonna make this up to you

Because we’re holding our own in a great big storm
And though we’re cutting it close
We won’t let go

It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

I can’t stand myself
And all the curse words that fall from my mouth
I can’t stand myself
Or my legs as they run from the ones here to help
But I just woke up with you next to me
Some new air to breathe
And a belief that it’s all gonna be alright
I can’t stand myself
But it’s high time that we gave it a try
And I think I’m gonna finally give myself a new try

Because I'm holding our own in a great big storm

And won’t let go",Great Big Storm
Nate Ruess,"I was born before the storm
My mother placed a dozen thorns
The sorry's and the take it back's
Lay silent in her folded hands and
Head to headstone I just danced
Oblivious to consequence
As morning sank into the ground
The highest branch I sorted out

Oh, I didn't mean to let it go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
And when she said to me it's still a ghost[?]

All your love may fade away
All you'll become may all go to waste
So I can't stand to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse

Oh you caught me come to life
The moment when your eyes met mine
And from your bed, the sun came in
And to this day it never set
But here's to this I'm used to it[?]
I stepped out for some cigarettes
The neon lights they called me in
Her eyes like yours, just different

And no, I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
What didn't mean a thing destroyed us both
Darling

All your love may fade away
All you'll become may all go to waste
So I can't stand to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse

I couldn't quite believe
The way you used to pull me down
It takes its toll[?]
I survived
The laws of gravity
Destroyed some property
I would not let them sink their teeth into my soul
Whoa-oh

All I love may fade away
All I become may all go to waste
So I can't stand, hear it say it hurts
When it only gets much worse

All we'll become may all go to waste

Nate Ruess,"Well, you were burning up the sky
Looking for a light when you saved me
I was convinced no one would take me
You turned and took me by the hand
But now that look in your eyes
All of your sighs are saying ""Go, please""
""Leave me alone and leave you lonely""
It looks as though we've reached the end

Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment
I'm alright right here on the floor
Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment to cry

And when I think about the ways
That you never waste your breath to say you love me
How you always held your lost loves above me
As you kept your other hand on the door
Yet I'll admit I might miss
Every scar and every wish that we'd make
But our wishes were nothing but ways
To act as if we could use the change
Well, maybe one of these days
We'll cross each other on a train to our new lives
We could talk about the old times
And how we're glad we made it out alive

But for now I'll sit and drink
As I think about the night that your father died
And I said I'd never leave your side
We once swore we could defeat this
Therefore, please excuse this little bit of weakness, oh

Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment of your time
To get all my things and let go
Well, I’m fine
I just need a moment to say goodbye

Well, Lord give me a reason
C'mon, show me you love me
I don't want to let it go
Just to watch it fly
And Lord, give me a moment
Any of it, show me
I don't want to feel it
I don't wanna watch it go by

Because I'm fine
I just need a moment
I'm alright right here on the floor
Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment to say I'm fine
I need a moment
I'm alright here on the floor
Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment to cry",Moment
Nate Ruess,"I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love

Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I want to rest in your light

I am nothing without love
I’m just these thoughts without a pen
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love",Nothing Without Love
Nate Ruess,"Well we're just two ships passing through the night
Two lost lonely people inside
I wanted to hold you tight
Or get away
Your eyes don't look close to mine
Lonely times and the people the same
You've seen what you've been
And you mean what you say
And you say what it is

Just take it back
Take it back
What we had
Take it

I wanna hold you tight
These days turn so lonely tonight
I wanna kiss your lips and get away
Sometimes lonely people change
And these days get so lonely in May
I try so hard to make what I can't seem to say
And these days get so far away
And I want what I can't say
So take it back

Oh, it's gonna come a day
Oh, it's gonna come a day
So take it back
Take it back
So take it back
Take it, no, no, no

Well we're just two ships passing through the night
Two lost lonely people inside
I wanted your touch, but you can't feel my fingers; I can't say too much
So I (try) try to get away
Oh, why did I stay?
Oh, you got this little lonely-hearted man
And you cry all the time, and I know
That these days, they don't go where they go
And I can't feel my hands anymore

So take it back
Take it back
What we had
Take it back
Just take it back
Take it back
What we had
Just take it, just take it
Just take it back",Take It Back
Nate Ruess,"Someone sucked the life out of the room
When that someone said goodbye much too soon
I’d hate for you to love me cause you saw me out
with someone who you read about in the news
But I guess that’s what this world is coming to

I watched as your wrists began to bruise
Threading ribbons weaving patterns
Beautiful and blue
All your late nights came to life
And then died upon just one dislike
Never mind all the people that you moved
But I guess that’s what this world is coming to

So let’s get high here in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I think I’m gonna shine in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead

So let’s get high in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I know I’m gonna shine here in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead

You know that I can’t stop thinkin’ bout you
You’re the source of everything I do
You brought faith to songs I sing
So I went and bought a diamond ring
I wanna spend each night here with you
Yeah you took everything I was
And you turned it into something I’ve become
Good god what’s a boy to do?

But I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world is, is coming to

But that would only make this harder
She can't stand to sleep alone
Oh no and I hate losing so
I wait till we get tired

Well the could outside knows we can't be alone
So I throw my arms right beside hers
Then I close my eyes lean in for something more
And you light my fire

As your heartbeat keeps me warm
We take Fourth Street cross corners to the bar
Where I slurred convinced we could make it brighter

I know we're not as young as we'd like to be
But I like to think you're bound to get the best of me
C'mon babe your love gets me high

I know one day I'll fall for an oath
I just spend all my life trying to find her
But I burned down every door I'd ever shut
When you light my fire

I wanna throw the fight and kiss away your pain tonight
But that would only make this better

Knockin on the door I'm at your house
You open up and say that you're not even ready at all

Nate57,"Ich fühl' mich wie besessen von einem Dschini
Ich trinke ein Martini an der Bar,
Mit den Piraten, ist meine Familie
Wir sind in irgendeiner Stadt gestrandet, wo wir nie waren
Verlorene Seelen die sich zusammentrommeln um Parra zu kriegen
Lass dich nicht täuschen die Oase bleibt 'ne Fata Morgana
Wie die Schlangen die dich in den Irrweg führen wollen, sei immer wachsam
Schwimmen in feindlichen Gewässer, trage mein Messer
Auf der Jagd nach Gold mit der Hoffnung danach wird alles besser
Ich sah viele Leute die scheiterten dran
Kein Caravan, alleine durchs Land 50 Grad,
Bis ihr verstand sie verlässt, fast wie bei ner Geisterstadt
Die Menschen konnten nicht lern', wollten immer mehr
Durchsuch' nochmal alle Schränke gründlich denn die Konten sind schon leer
Kleine Rast, aber dann weiter lass nicht Zeit verliern' vor Sonnenuntergang
Müssen wir zum geheimen Platz und uns den Schatz einkassiern'
Digga bleib lieber hier denn ich hab die Karte
Wir folgen schon lange dem Weg auf der Straße
Die Schrift ist verschlüsselt,
Viele fielen im Fall weil sie keiner vorwarnte

Alles dreht sich, ich krieg ein Hitzeschlag, Fata Morgana
Halluzination und der Wüstensand bringen mich vom Pfad ab
Kreuzt du unsern Weg wird dein Schiff gekapert
Land in Sicht, dürfen nicht aufgeben sind schon nah dran

Alles dreht sich, ich krieg ein Hitzeschlag, Fata Morgana
Halluzination und der Wüstensand bringen mich vom Pfad ab
Kreuzt du unsern Weg wird dein Schiff gekapert
Land in Sicht, dürfen nicht aufgeben sind schon nah dran

Wir ziehen durch das Land von Stand- zu Standort
Sei immer gut gewadmet denn hier endet es schnell in nem' Sandsturm
Lass unnötige Last zurück, sonst werden wir nicht vorankommen
Folge ihr nicht diese Frau ist ein Phantom,
Geb ich dir mit als ne Warnung
Viele merken zu spät die Verwandlung
Werden Handlungsunfähig und
Enden wie bei Medusa versteinert im Käfig
Alle Gefährten ham's versuchst doch sie ließen sich verleiten
Von der Schönheit und von Versprechen die sie nie halten
Dürre Zeiten, seh ein Kaktus da am Horizont,
Grün, ein gutes Omen sind durstig wollen raus aus dem trockenen komm'
Sei vorsichtig denn das alles kann nur Illusion sein
Besessen, hat nur einmal was von der falschen Frucht gegessen, sein Urteil
Hier war's mal voller Leben doch die Seelen sind verdunstet
Zeugen unzählige Fossilien und Muscheln, verschwundener Dschungel
Sehen 'ne Höhle mit Wandmalerei, sie zeigen auf 'nen Tunnel
Unser Ziel nicht mehr weit noch ein letzten Blick in die Runde und ich merk..

Come neve d'estate

Le nostre paure immotivate, congelate

In punta di piedi senza potersi fermare

Ma sento il tuo calore forte
Negli angoli bui delle mie stanze gelate
Appesa al tuo respiro mi vedo cadere
Per poi ritornare a sentirmi felice

Ma la tensione che sento verso il tuo respiro
Mi distoglie dal pensiero
Di tutto ciò che abbiamo perso
E credo a volte di volere riparare
Di poter ricostruire
Tutto nuovo e un po' diverso

Ma sento il tuo calore forte
Negli angoli bui delle mie stanze gelate
Appesa al tuo respiro mi vedo cadere

Nathan Berg,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Nathan Brian Wine,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Nathan Brian Wine,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket
In his tin cup I did drop it
I heard him say as I made my retreat

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

Found a hundred-dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came a-runnin'
Gave him back his dime for phonin'

Taxi driver said ""We'll make it just the same""

I've been the one who should've said 
Maybe I'm wrong and I've always been that way

Have you fallen from where glory sprouts 
Are you cut off in fields and pressed down 
Like an early spring till that don't come around

I think I'm waiting too long 
You tried this panting and poured
You set a course to cross me out

Lookin' for a place to stay. 
I was mighty, mighty tired, 
I had gone a long, long way. 
I said, ""Hey, hey, in there, 
Is there anybody home?"" 
I was standin' on the steps 
Feelin' most alone. 
Well, out comes a farmer, 
He must have thought that I was nuts. 
He immediately looked at me 
And stuck a gun into my guts. 

I fell down 
To my bended knees, 
Saying, ""I dig farmers, 
Don't shoot me, please!"" 
He cocked his rifle 
And began to shout, 
""You're that travelin' salesman 
That I have heard about."" 
I said, ""No! No! No!

I'm a clean-cut kid 
And I been to college, too.""

Whose name was Rita.
She looked like she stepped out of 
La Dolce Vita. 
I immediately tried to cool it 
With her dad, 
And told him what a 
Nice, pretty farm he had. 
He said, ""What do doctors 
Know about farms, pray tell?"" 
I said, ""I was born 
At the bottom of a wishing well

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails 
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie. 
""I guess you're tired,"" 
He said, kinda sly. 
I said, ""Yes, ten thousand miles 
Today I drove."" 
He said, ""I got a bed for you 
Underneath the stove.
Just one condition 
And you go to sleep right now, 
That you don't touch my daughter 
And in the morning, milk the cow."" 

I was sleepin' like a rat 
When I heard something jerkin'.
There stood Rita 
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins. 
She said, ""Would you like to take a shower? 
I'll show you up to the door."" 
I said, ""Oh, no! no! 
I've been through this before."" 
I knew I had to split 
But I didn't know how, 
When she said, 
""Would you like to take that shower, now?"" 

Well, I couldn't leave 
Unless the old man chased me out, 
'Cause I'd already promised 
That I'd milk his cows.
I had to say something 
To strike him very weird, 
So I yelled out, 
""I like Fidel Castro and his beard."" 
Rita looked offended 
But she got out of the way, 
As he came charging down the stairs 
Sayin', ""What's that I heard you say?"" 

I said, ""I like Fidel Castro, 
I think you heard me right,"" 
And ducked as he swung 
At me with all his might.
Rita mumbled something 
'Bout her mother on the hill, 
As his fist hit the icebox, 
He said he's going to kill me 
If I don't get out the door 
In two seconds flat, 
""You unpatriotic, 
Rotten doctor Commie rat."" 

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest 
At my head and I did run, 
I did a somersault 
As I seen him get his gun 
And crashed through the window 
At a hundred miles an hour, 
And landed fully blast 
In his garden flowers.
Rita said, ""Come back!"" 
As he started to load 
The sun was comin' up 
And I was runnin' down the road. 

Well, I don't figure I'll be back 
There for a spell, 
Even though Rita moved away 
And got a job in a motel. 
He still waits for me, 
Constant, on the sly.
He wants to turn me in 
To the F.B.I.

Nathaniel Street-West,"So now!
Coming out of the languid water
Shimmering from brightness of 
The American night

There, over there!

Alive the city
But wait it’s far away

Walking distant days,
Driving distant hours

It is alive though
It’s said to be so

Alive in the mute aliveness of being alive
Like a good muffled kick drum… ah! Music

That’s one of the reasons why
Why the city alive does there lie in lye

“Don’t lie to me”
Say’s the dirty scoundrel who aches all day
Taking away my thoughts to be placed in abstract morality based,
Dry with clink stains, 
Dry
Dry as a bone, how mutely solemn it is to grow up there

The only thing bringing water
Being your flaming tongue, with words of existentialism
“Here try this”
“What is it, peyote?”
“It is indeed,” says the coyote”

“Ah! Everything now much, much more dryer”
Oh no that won’t do,
And away I walk
Like a battered angel (aren’t we all)
Escaping from the war

Now I’m out alone in the moonlit night
Again seeing the city…
Alive I tell ya!
It ain’t so groovy though, when you’re in it
Drowning in the selfish day
Ah again! Away!
Eagle bearing sorrows but I think
“So! It’s a beautiful bird. Take me away oh fare hawk.”

Now lying in a gutter beside an outskirt road
High stalks of weed’s all around
To my left out of the gutter,
High straws and above a starless night…
Why? Because to my right across the highway
Across more weeds and stalks of brown floral,
An airport in its selfless mutiny
(Bright lights lighting up, oh i’d say at about)
200 yards away the whole of it infamously stands
(Rather than wonder who I am or where I am)
Like all occurrences during night and day
I travel on foot, leave my car parked behind me
Seems as i’d taken a nap,
Although you can’t really be sure in a place like this
“Where am i”? I say
Then, looking at my shoes, say “just kidding,” and walk on
Crossing the highway
For now completely absorbed in the moment

It seems like i’ve had this dream before
But don’t it always
Walking now through lugubrious fields of brown tall grass
And gravel,
I come to the concrete runway
Clouds, many clouds, must be the reason for no stars…i think.
So I get back to my car in what seemed like a shudder of a millionth,
(Billionth of a second)
(Tick-clocking, tick-tocking it’s way closer to a second)

And what it calls an infinity
Really being less than a minute…
Much like us waiting for death

Look outside…

Oh, oh,
Mind won’t leave me alone",Mind
Nathaniel Street-West,"The last time I saw
Poor repugnant
He was walking on towards
The sky way
With banana peel eyes and
Sorrow sentences

Singings songs of his disposition

With his rail rod instincts and
His material poof by his side
Some say he would go forever and
Never die
But me I knew that someday
His time would come

Singings songs of his disposition

With his long fur coat that
He had covered in plastic
With his concubine and
His cigarettes
He lumbered on

He was gonna pray to Ra
To light his eternal 
Smoke",Repugnant James
Nathaniel Street-West,"I’m going down
That road of life
Going down
That road of life
I’m going down
That road of life

Feeling sad
Feeling bad

My baby she left me
She gone away
Said my woman left me
She gone away

She went and left me
On a big jet plane

I’m going down
That road of life
Going down
That road of life
I’m going down
That road of life
	
Feeling sad
Feeling bad",Road of Life
Nathaniel Street-West,"Milk cartons delivered daily
Put under the waving American flag
Newspaper folded neatly 
Coffee ground fresh for the dad

The sun he rise’s early
Puts Visine in his eyes
He’s got an exam on junk he memorized the day before
Which he’ll forget as soon as the teacher gives the “A”

And there’s a sound like thunder
That feeling you get when there’s incoming rain

The wife she eats her milk and honey
And turns on the AM radio
Good morning Bill O’liely’ 
Always like to here your show

Meanwhile in the segregated projects
There aint no honey or waving flag
The tenement has a thousand eyes like mollock
With drapes winking and winking
Against the frozen sun

And there’s a sound like thunder
That feeling you get when there’s someone on the run

There’s a thousand WASP’s on all the flowers
And they’re changing the way the flowers grow
They’re sucking out and feeding back false knowledge
So as the flowers they grow deformed

There are masquerading angels at the palace
But there horns they show through but no one cares to notice
They got their hand inside each other’s pockets

And there’s a sound like thunder	
That sense you get when you know something’s wrong

Give me your warm embrace

As I lie against this stone
Put your skin against mine
I’ve got to go back out in this rain…

Who needs religion when you got money?
Who need to care when gods on your side?
These crutch chairs are liquid and filled with water
They engulf you and cripple you from inside

The bush is burning and there’s a tire on fire
Rolling down this empty freeway
To save the unit I shot first cause’ I saw em’ coming
But my time had come

And there’s a sound like thunder
Coming from the barrel of a gun
And there’s a sound like thunder
Coming from a bomb	
There’s nothing like the sound of thunder
When it means your time has come!",Thunder

Nathen Page,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride
Nathen Page,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Nathen Page,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
